                correctAnswer: "Its displacement pattern helps determine the origin of adjacent masses.",
                explanation: "The text highlights: 'Displacement and distortion of the PPS secondary to mass effect from lesions arising along the PPS border is an informative finding.' and 'Surrounding mass lesions shift the PPS in specific directions, serving as a signature for the source of origin.'"

                correctAnswer: "Benign Mixed Tumor (BMT) from ectopic rests",
                explanation: "The text states: 'Primary PPS masses are rare, but if no clear contributor from the surrounding spaces is identified, the source is likely minor salivary gland ectopic rests. The most common tumor arising from these rests is a BMT.'"
