Violet Sets Sail

Violet stood on the promenade deck of the Lusitania; her hand tucked into her husband
Henry's. The sea breeze ruffled her hair as she looked out over the waten barely able to
contain her excitement and nerves. She was really on her way to England—-to his England.

101
“Do you think they 'll..like me?”

she asked softly, glancing up at
him.

Henry gave her hand a
reassuring squeeze. “How could
they not? You're brilliant, Violet.
They'll see that.” But even as
he spoke, there was a hint of
uncertainty in his eyes.

Violet let out a laugh, though it
was a little shaky. “[ hope you re
right. I still can't believe I'm
here. A poor seamstress from
New York on the deck of the
Lusitania, married to a proper
English lord. It sounds more like
a fairy tale than real life.”

Henry grinned, his arm slipping
around hen “And yet, here you
are.”

Violet's smile was shy. “Yes, here =
Iam. Here we are. Her words
were heavy with meaning. Seven
long months from now, they
would have a little one joining
them. “You broke so many rules for me, Henry. °

Henry watched the receding shoreline, a bit more serious now. "Yes, I did. My family expects
certain...well, let's just say they won't be as open-minded as I'd like. My parents wanted me
to marry someone with a title, wealth, the proper background.’ Not...” he hesitated,
glancing at her apologetically, ‘not a girl from the tenements. °

Even in the early 1900s, it was highly unusual for an English lord or aristocrat to marry
someone outside of his social class. Aristocratic families valued tradition, wealth, and social
status, and marriages were often arranged or encouraged to maintain and even strengthen
these advantages. If a lord did marry outside his class, there could be serious consequences.

Families were often strict about “marrying up’ or “marrying equal.” Marrying a poor or
lower-class person would likely bring strong opposition from parents or guardians. His family
might see the marriage as shameful, viewing his spouse as “unworthy” of the family name
and privileges, which could cause family rifts and even estrangement.

102
Many aristocrats depended on family wealth and support to maintain their estates. If a lord
married someone outside his class, his family might withdraw financial support, including
inheritance or allowances. Without these funds, he might struggle to maintain the family
estate and lifestyle.

The aristocracy was also a close-knit group, and reputation was everything. Marrying
“below” his class could lead to social isolation. Friends and neighbors in high society might look
down on the marriage and avoid the couple at events, parties, and gatherings. This could
make the couple feel like outcasts within their own world.

In some cases, a marriage outside the class could risk the lord’s position in society on if the
marriage displeased a title-holding figure (like a father or elder relative), he might even lose
his rights to certain titles or privileges within the family.

Marrying for love was a brave decision but often came with a heavy cost, one that many
aristocrats avoided.

Violet swallowed, feeling the weight of what lay ahead. “I know, and I'm prepared... or as
prepared as I can be.” She squeezed his hand. “But if things get

hard, and if they...” her voice wavered. “If they don't accept

us, I don't want you to lose everything, Henry. I could never ask
that of you.”

Henry turned her to face him, his hands on her shoulders.
“You're my wife, Violet. We'll face this togethen no matter what
happens.” He smiled, glancing down at her growing belly. “And
maybe the thought of a grandchild will soften their hearts?”

Violet and Henry jumped up and without saying a word ran for the stairs. When they
reached the deck, the ship was already keeling a bit to the side. Captains Turner and
Anderson were near the bridge waving their arms and ordering everyone to stay out of the
lifeboats, and that the ship would be fine. “We've been hit by a torpedo, but the engine room
said we are in no immediate danger! Don't lower the boats. No need!”

As if to contradict him, the ship listed (titted to the side) a bit more sharply. Most of the
passengers soundly ignored the captains, wrestled themselves into life jackets, and ran for
the lifeboats anyway.

For one moment Violet thought of the Triangle Shirtwaist factory fire all those years ago
and was filled with a choking panic, but Henry took charge and pulled her toward the
lifeboats. Everything was confusion and noise and fear as men helped load frightened women
and children onto the swinging decks of the boats.

Violet shook her head violently. “I won't be separated from youl I won't!”

Henry had a wild look in his eyes. “Don't be daft. Get in a boat. I'll help some of the others
and will find another way. Think of our child!”

Suddenly the Lusitania began to tilt even more severely to the starboard side. With the ship
leaning sharply, launching the lifeboats became a frantic struggle. The boats now swung too
far out, making it almost impossible for passengers to board safely. Neither captain was
anywhere to be seen at this point.

In an instant, Violet and Henry
realized that even if a person was to
make it into a boat-the ship's
leaning side would soon overtake
them. They were placing people into
what would become a trap. There
was no way those boats could clear
the ship in time. A brave steward
was frantically cutting away at the
thick ropes connecting one of the
lifeboats to the ship with a
pocketknife. If he could get the boat
into the water more quickly, perhaps
the passengers inside it could escape
the impending doom.

There was no time to watch and see
if he was successful. Things were
happening more rapidly than anyone
could believe! Henry grabbed Violet's
hand, and they ran toward the port
side while stuffing themselves into
awkward life vests and attempting
to fasten the straps.

On the port side, a different
nightmare unfolded. The lifeboats
scraped against the hull as they were lowered, snagging on the ship's rivets—tiny, inch-high
obstacles that threatened to tear the lifeboats apart before they could even reach the
waten

Violet's heart pounded as she watched several boats overturn as they were lowered, spilling
passengers into the churning sea. Others, as they hit the waten were immediately tossed
about by the ship's motion, capsizing or crashing back against the side of the ship.

A few panicked screams filled the ain One lifeboat even came crashing down onto the deck,
crushing passengers in its path and sliding uncontrollably toward the bridge. Violet felt
Henry's grip tighten around her hand, grounding her in the chaos, but she knew they
couldn t wait much longer They were running out of options—and fast.

The two suddenly collided with a man dressed smartly in a knickerbocker suit who was looking
calm despite the chaos. It was Charles from yesterday's luncheon!

Charles had a determined look in his eye and waved his hand toward the quickly approaching
water

recommend you do the same.”

Henry nodded, “You're right.
Violet, take off your shoes. °
He nodded to Charles, relieved
to have some sort of solution.
“Let's do this.” Then he forced
a smile toward Violet. ‘T'll be
right with you, my darling.
Everything is going to be OK. I
promise.”

Violet was terrified. She
couldn t swim, but Charles
assured her that the bulky life
vests would do their job.

The three headed for the rail. Charles was urging some others nearby to join them.

“We're going to have to jump, and then you'll need to swim away as fast as possible. Just
follow me and be prepared for a vortex when the ship goes unden Violet, just kick your legs
and paddle your arms. Look for a bit of wreckage to grab onto. You'll do great."

The next moments were a watery whirlwind with no other thought but survival.

The whole thing was over in 18 minutes. The Lusitania’s mighty hull slipped under the water
leaving the sea around it littered with people, shattered pieces of the ship, floating deck
chairs, and scattered debris.

The rest of the story is up to you. Did Violet and Henry survive? Did cousin William? If they
did, how were they received by Henry's family? You are in charge of the ending. You can
write it down or dream it up next time you are doing a chore like cleaning your room. Will you
make it a happy ending? A tragedy? Sometimes we don't have all of the information about
events in history, and someone like you comes along and turns it into a tale. We need good
writers or dreamers like you to bring history to life!

As you read on, somewhere in this book, you'll see the ending I chose. I'm not going to tell
you where to find it, though! You'll have to come across it later!

For some clues to how the story could end, you can read the real-life account of what
happened to one of the real characters: Charles! He wrote a short book in 1915 about his
experiences aboard the sinking ship and what happened afterwards.

The Lusitania's Last Voyage by Jr Charles Emelius Lauriat

In a single moment, the Lusitania went from being a symbol of luxury to a tragic memory-a
grand ship that was caught between the lives it carried and the war that ultimately sank it.
Among the nearly 1,200 people lost, 128 were American passengers. Back in the United
States families mourned, newspapers roared with outrage, and people demanded answers.
How could innocent civilians—men, women, and children—be targeted like this? Americans
were furious! The outrage was so strong that the United States began to seriously question
its position in the wan Could they really remain neutral when their own citizens were being

killed?

The tragedy ignited a wave of anti-German feelings all over the United States. President
Woodrow Wilson, a man of peace, was forced to confront the growing tension. The Kaiser
(the German leader), caught between military ambitions and diplomatic pressure, issued a
formal apology and promised reparations (paying money to those who were wronged). But
the damage was done. The sinking of the Lusitania had irrevocably changed the course of
history, pushing the United States closer to the brink of wan

Newspapers in America continued to report
horrific stories from the front lines, tales
of trench warfare, gas attacks, and
soldiers enduring brutal conditions in “no

challenging by the day.
