CIVILIAN CONSERVATION CORPS (CCC)

David Nowak stepped off the bus at his new home for the next year—a CCC camp nestled
near a wide meadow lined by cottonwood trees in a northern corner of Illinois. Rows of
wooden barracks lined the area, with a dining hall at the center A stern but friendly
supervisor greeted the group of new men.

“Welcome to Camp Pine,” he said. “You're here to work hard, learn discipline, and make a
difference. And don't forget—your families are counting on you. Wash up for dinnen
Tomorrow is going to be a long day as we build
some trails through the forest! Jack will issue
your clothing as soon as you get settled.’ He
pointed to a man lounging against one of the
structure's beams who lifted his hand and

After stowing his gear under a simple, metal-
framed bed, David proudly stood in line to
receive a uniform, work boots, and gloves. It
had been impossible to find a job in his New
York neighborhood, and at 20 years old, he
felt as if he'd been a burden for his aging
parents, though they would never say anything
of the sort to him. Now, he would be sending
most of his wages home to their little
apartment in New York to help supplement
their meager income.

meals, medical care, and a monthly wage of $30. However the men could only keep $5 for
themselves and were required to send $25 home to support their families.

The men worked on a variety of forestry related projects. They created trails in the
forests, planted trees, fought fires, improved streams and stocked them with fish, built fire

lookout towers, sprayed areas of land to prevent mosquitoes, and other related jobs.
