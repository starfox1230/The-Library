MARCH 14, 1932: THE
SEARCH AND THE
MYSTERY DEEPENS

As the days pass, the search for the child
has intensified. A massive network of law
enforcement, private detectives, and
volunteers have combed through the area
surrounding the Lindbergh estate. The
authorities have questioned numerous
suspects, but no clear leads have emerged.
With the Lindberghs’ fame and fortune,
many are wondering if the crime was a
result of targeting the family for ransom,
or if there might be deeper motives
involved.

Was the family under surveillance before
the abduction? Was there someone close to
them who could have had a hand in it? The
authorities have not ruled out any
possibilities, including an inside connection.

Despite the unsettling details and mounting
fean the Lindbergh family is not without
support. The case has united Americans,
with donations pouring in to help fund the

investigation. The newspapers and media outlets have covered the event extensively, keeping
the public updated on every new development in the case.
