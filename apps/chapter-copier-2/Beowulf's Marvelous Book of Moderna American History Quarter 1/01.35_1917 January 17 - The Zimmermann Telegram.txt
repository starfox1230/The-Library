together make peace; we shall give

general financial support, and it is

understood that Mexico is to reconquer y,
her lost territory of New Mexico, Texas

and Arizona. The details are left to you for settlement.

You are instructed to inform the President of Mexico of the above in the greatest
confidence as soon as it is certain that there will be an outbreak of war with the United
States, and suggest that the President of Mexico shall on his own initiative communicate with
Japan suggesting the latter's adherence at once to this plan, and at the same time offer to
mediate between Germany and Japan.

Please call to the attention of the President of Mexico that the employment of ruthless
submarine warfare now promises to compel England to make peace in a few months

Ahhhh! The treachery of the Germans! It makes my heart weep to
see it, but here is the translation of the telegram:

We plan to attack any ship, regardless of nationality. We hope the
United States will remain neutral. Howeven if the U.S. declares war on
us, we urge you fo join our side. In exchange, we will provide money and
military support to help you reclaim the territories of New Mexico,
Texas, and Arizona.

Now here's where it gets even
more interesting. The telegram,
sent through undersea cables, was
intercepted by British intelligence.
The British, who d been monitoring
communication channels, managed
to decode the message and were
shocked by what they read. They
knew this was exactly the kind of
spark that could change everything
in their favor

So, the British immediately sent
the decoded telegram to President
Woodrow Wilson. When news of
the message broke, Americans
were stunned. The idea of Germany asking Mexico to attack the U.S. was outrageous.
People felt betrayed, realizing that Germany wasnt just waging a war far across the
ocean-it was willing to strike close to home.

At this point, the U.S. had already been angered by Germany's unrestricted submarine
warfare, which had sunk several American ships. But the Zimmermann Telegram felt like a
personal, direct threat to American soil. It was the final straw. President Wilson, who had
worked hard to keep the U.S. out of the conflict, now saw that neutrality was no longer an
option. He went before Congress, asking for a declaration of wan saying that America
needed to fight ‘to make the world safe for democracy."
