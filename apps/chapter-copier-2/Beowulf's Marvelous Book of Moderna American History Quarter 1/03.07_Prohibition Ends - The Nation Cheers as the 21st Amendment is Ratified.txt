PROHIBITION ENDS: THE NATION CHEERS AS THE
21ST AMENDMENT IS RATIFIED

December 5, 1933

In a historic turn of events, Prohibition has officially come to an end. The 2]st Amendment
was ratified today, marking the end of the nationwide ban on alcohol that has lasted for 13
long years.

The amendment, which passed with overwhelming support, gives states the power to
regulate the sale and distribution of alcohol. Americans across the country are celebrating
the return of legal drinking, and businesses are in a flurry of preparations for a resurgence
of bars, breweries, and distilleries.

The end of Prohibition is seen as a victory for many, especially for those who have struggled
with the rise of illegal speakeasies and violent organized crime during the alcohol ban. The
legal sale of alcohol is expected to provide a much-needed boost to the economy as the
country continues to recover from the Great Depression.

As the nation celebrates, cities are already buzzing with a bit of cheer during these tough
times.
