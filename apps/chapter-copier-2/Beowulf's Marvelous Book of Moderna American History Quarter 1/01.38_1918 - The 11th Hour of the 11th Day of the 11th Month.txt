1918: THE 11TH HOUR OF THE 11TH DAY OF THE
11TH MONTH (WEEK 5 DAY 2

On the crisp morning of November 11, 1918, the world waited in suspense. It was the IIth
hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, and the Great War-the war to end all wars, as it
was called—was finally coming to an end. For 4 long years, the batHefields of Europe had
echoed with the thunder of artillery, the cries of soldiers, and the relentless horror of wan

In the muddy trenches, weary soldiers waited anxiously, their hearts pounding with a mix of
hope and disbelief The news had spread: an armistice (truce) had been signed. At precisely

11:00 AM, the guns would fall silent. The minutes ticked by, feeling like hours, until at last,
the appointed time arrived. Then, as if a switch was flipped, the roaring of artillery ceased.

For a moment, a soft silence blanketed the battlefields, broken only by the sound of a gentle

breeze rustling the fallen leaves. It was as if everyone was collectively holding their breath,
but then cheers erupted!

Back in the United States, the news of the armistice caused an emotional flood of joy and
relief Cities across the nation broke out in celebration. In New York, confetti rained down
from skyscrapers as jubilant crowds danced in the streets. Bands played patriotic songs,
and church bells rang out in triumph. In small towns, parades were hastily organized, and
families gathered to share the long-awaited news with loved ones.

The end of the war brought both relief and sorrow. America had lost over 116,000
soldiers, and many others returned home carrying the physical and emotional scars of
battle. Some men had trouble sleeping and panicked at the sound of gunfire or loud noises,
while others suffered from trembling hands, headaches, or difficulty speaking. Today, we

understand that many of these men were likely experiencing concussive brain damage and/or
PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder).

Concussive brain damage happens when the brain is repeatedly shaken or exposed to
powerful blasts, which can cause lasting injury to brain cells. In wan soldiers were often

type of damage could cause memory loss, difficulty concentrating, and emotional problems
like anxiety or fear

PTSD, or post-traumatic stress disorden is a mental health condition that can develop after
experiencing or witnessing a very scary, shocking, or dangerous event. People with PTSD
might continue feeling fean stress, or anxiety long after the event has passed. They may
have nightmares, unwanted memories, trouble sleeping, or intense reactions to things that
remind them of the trauma.

Back then, people didn t fully understand these injuries, but today we recognize that these
brave soldiers faced lasting effects from the intense blasts they experienced on the

battlefield.

The Spanish flu pandemic had also compounded the nation's grief, taking even more lives.
Families mourned their losses, and communities grieved together

As soldiers returned, they brought with them stories of adventure, hardship, and a new
understanding of the world beyond America’s borders. These experiences would shape the
“Lost Generation’ - young Americans who had seen the horrors of war and now felt
disillusioned (disappointed and bitter), unsure of what came next.

Yet, there was also a sense of triumph. America had played a crucial role in the Allied
victory, emerging as a global superpower while other countries were weakened by wan
