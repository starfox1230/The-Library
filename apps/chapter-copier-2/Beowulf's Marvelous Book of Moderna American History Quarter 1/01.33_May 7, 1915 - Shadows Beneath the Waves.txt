The Lusitania was no ordinary ship. It
was like a floating palace, complete | ety ee ie.

rooms that looked like they belonged in | | |
a royal mansion. Built by the British,
the Lusitania was famous for being
modern, fast, and incredibly luxurious.

Wealthy travelers loved it, drawn to
the first-class cabins with their fine
wood paneling, soft carpets, and
beautiful furniture. The ship boasted
cutting-edge amenities for its time: a
wireless telegraph, electric lights,
elevators, and even an early version of
air conditioning.

Meals on board included dozens of gourmet dishes like shrimp, lamb pot pie, grilled steak,
boar's head, and beautifully crafted pastries fit for a five-star restaurant.

It wasn't just the rich and famous who traveled aboard, though; the Lusitania welcomed
people from all walks of life, from middle-class families to immigrants dreaming of a fresh
start in America.

This grand ship had a busy schedule, making regular trips across the Atlantic between New
York and Liverpool, England. With its speed and style, the Lusitania quickly became one of
the top choices for those who could afford to cross the ocean in comfort. Besides
passengers, it carried loads of cargo, including mail and other goods.

Now, here's where things got tricky. Germany had a problem. They knew Britain was
probably using ships, even luxury liners like the Lusitania, to smuggle in supplies from the
United States to support their war effort. To make it harder for Britain, Germany
announced they'd use their submarines to attack any ship heading to British ports, even
ones carrying passengers. They thought this would be a good way to stop Britain from
getting the supplies they needed.

Howeven passengers on these ships, like those aboard the Lusitania, were unaware of the
danger They were simply traveling, hoping for a safe journey. They had no idea they might
be sharing space with hidden military supplies.

So, while the Lusitania was a marvel of speed and luxury, it was also sailing into dangerous
waters.
