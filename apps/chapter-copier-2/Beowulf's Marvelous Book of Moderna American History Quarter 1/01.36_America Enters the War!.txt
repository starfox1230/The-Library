AMERICA ENTERS THE WAR!

Suddenly, the war wasn't just Europe's problem—it had become a direct threat to American
sovereignty. On April 2, 1917, President Wilson went before Congress. His words were
powerful and stirring: “The world must be made safe for democracy.” Congress agreed, and
the United States declared war on Germany four days laten

The United States had just entered the Great Wan and the entire nation was rallying to
support the troops overseas. American soldiers, known as ‘doughboys,’ crossed the Atlantic
to join the fray. They brought fresh energy, resources, and hope to the weary Allied
forces. Everywhere you looked, people were eager to do their part to help win the wan

On the busy streets of cities and towns, you could see patriotic posters plastered on walls,
urging citizens to buy war bonds and stamps. These bonds were like loans to the government
and buying them meant you were financially supporting the war effort. But it wasnt just
adults getting involved— President Woodrow Wilson had a special plan to mobilize the younger
generation as well. He called on children in youth organizations, like the Boy Scouts, to help
raise money for the war effort.

The idea was clever: these kids, armed with their war bond collection kits, would go around
their neighborhoods asking adults fo pitch in for the war effort. Adults who were hesitant to
buy bonds often felt a little embarrassed or guilty when a child would come up to them with
hopeful eyes, asking for help supporting “our boys” overseas. In a way, the kids’ efforts
helped mobilize public opinion—they were like small ambassadors of patriotism, inspiring
neighbors, teachers,
and even their own
parents to join the
cause.

“Come on, Mr Loomen
buy a bond!" a young
scout might call out to
his neighbor with
enthusiasm. ‘It's for
our soldiers fighting
overseas!"

Seeing the dedication
of these young patriots
often nudged grown-
ups to dig a little
deeper into their
pockets.

The war effort
touched every aspect
of daily life. Factories
that once made household goods were now producing weapons, ammunition, and uniforms.
Women stepped into roles traditionally held by men, taking up jobs in factories, offices, and
farms.

People were encouraged to conserve food, with campaigns like “Meatless Tuesdays” and
“Wheatless Wednesdays.” Citizens planted “Victory Gardens’ in their backyards and vacant
lots, growing their own vegetables so more food could go to the soldiers.

Everywhere you turned, the spirit of unity and sacrifice was palpable. Families wrote letters
to soldiers, knitted socks and scarves, and held community events to boost morale. Churches
held special prayer services, and parades filled the streets with patriotic fervon Everyone
felt connected to the wan even if they were thousands of miles away from the battlefields.

And so, through the combined efforts of men, women, and children alike, America’s home
front became a powerful engine driving the war effort, embodying the spirit of
determination and unity.

PANDEMICS STRIKES THE WORLD

— jumping rope rhyme, 1918

The country had just emerged from World War 1, soldiers were
coming home, and people were ready to celebrate. But instead of
peace, they found themselves in the midst of a deadly worldwide
pandemic that swept through cities, towns, and rural areas alike.

It began in the spring of 1918 when the war was in its final months. Soldiers, weakened by
the stresses of combat and exposure to chemical attacks, were especially hard-hit by what
was initially thought to be a bad case of the yearly flu. People assumed it was just a rough
flu season and believed it would pass within a few weeks. But this flu was different. It
spread with alarming speed, jumping from one person to the next and quickly sweeping
through cities and towns.

During the first wave, most infected people had typical flu symptoms like fever sore throat,
and headache. But, in the second wave, things took a terrifying turn. Many flu victims in
1918 showed a ghastly mauve-blue color on their face, lips, and ears, known as cyanosis. It
started with two dark, reddish- purple spots that appeared on the cheekbones. Within
hours, these spots would spread until the entire face turned a deep blue. Soon, the blackish
color would creep into the fingers and toes, then move up through the arms, legs, and even
into the chest. Patients struggled to breathe as fluid filled their lungs, almost as if they
were drowning from the inside.

In some cases, blood trickled from noses, mouths, and ears: a grim sign of internal damage.

Teeth and hair fell out. Coughing fits grew so intense that they tore muscles, leaving people

gasping for breath. Crippling headaches and body pains struck, turning every movement into
an agonizing ordeal.

It didn't just target the elderly or those who were already sick; young, healthy adults—
people who'd normally bounce back from the flu- were suddenly struck down, sometimes
within hours of showing symptoms. Hospitals quickly filled up, and doctors were baffled by
the intensity of the illness.

The Spanish flu was so dangerous partly because it caused something called a “cytokine
storm.’ The immune system has many parts that help you fight of f infections. It includes
different types of cells that send messages to each other using special molecules called
cytokines. Sometimes the body makes too many inflammatory cytokines and not enough

mM
calming cytokines to control them. The inflammatory cytokines start “storming out of
control, with nothing to keep them in check.

Imagine your body as a fortress with an immune system army ready to defend it. When a
bad germ, like the Spanish flu virus, tries to invade, your immune system quickly sends
soldiers to fight it of £ Normally, the immune system only sends enough soldiers to deal with
the invader without harming the fortress. Cytokines, the little messenger molecules, help
control this process.

In these cases, the body
released way too many
cytokines at once, like an
emergency alarm going of f
at full blast. Imagine that
instead of sending just
enough soldiers (white blood
cells), the immune system
sent all of them at once.

This flood of cytokines filled the lungs with blood and fluid, making it very hard to breathe.
Instead of helping, this immune system overreaction-the cytokine storm—ended up hurting
the body even more than the virus itself

As the flu spread across America, life changed in an instant. Schools, theaters, and
churches closed their doors, and people were urged to stay home. Cities passed laws
requiring everyone to wear masks, and newspapers published mask- making instructions. In
places like San Francisco, police patrolled the streets, ready to fine anyone caught without a
mask. Signs in public spaces read, “Wear a mask or go to jail!” It became common to see
people with cloth masks covering their faces, adding a strange, unsettling air to everyday

life.

In smaller towns, people stopped visiting neighbors or going out to socialize, and there was a
constant fear that the next person fo fall ill might be someone close. Coffins were in short
supply, and funeral homes struggled to keep up. Sometimes grieving families had to dig graves
for their dead loved ones, and gravediggers dumped corpses out of coffins into graves, so
they could use them over again.

The Bell Service brings cheer and encouragement to

Friends, whether close at hand or far away, can be
easily reached, because Bell Service is universal service.

community centers. Some people tried home
remedies, from eating raw onions to drinking
whiskey or hanging camphor around their neck,
hoping something might protect them.

By the time the Spanish flu finally eased in 1920,
it had claimed the lives of over 675,000
Americans. Everyone knew someone who had been
affected, and many families had lost loved ones.
The flu left scars on every community. It changed
America’s approach to health, made people more
conscious of hygiene, encouraged scientific
progress, and shaped how the country prepared
for future health crises. It was a challenging time,
but it ultimately left the country more prepared
for what might come next.
