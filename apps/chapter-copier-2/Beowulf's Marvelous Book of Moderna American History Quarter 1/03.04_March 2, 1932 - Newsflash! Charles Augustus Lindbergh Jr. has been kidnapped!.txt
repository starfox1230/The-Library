MARCH 2, 1932: NEWSFLASH! CHARLES AUGUSTUS
LINDBERGH JR. HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED!

The world was stunned this week when Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr, the 20-month-old
son of famed aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne, was kidnapped from the family's
secluded home in East Amwell Township, New Jersey. The young child's abduction has
sparked a nationwide manhunt and created a tense and uncertain time for the Lindbergh
family.

Charles Lindbergh, the world-renowned hero who made history by completing the first solo
nonstop transatlantic flight in 1927, is now a household name. His heroic accomplishments
and celebrity lifestyle, including a glamorous marriage to Anne Morrow, the accomplished
writer and aviatrix (female pilot), have made the Lindberghs the darlings of American
society. Their son Charles Jr, born in 1930, was a symbol of the family's dreams, living in
luxury on their wooded estate while being raised in a picture-perfect world.

That world was shattered when the unthinkable happened. Around 9:00 p.m. yesterday,
the Lindbergh family discovered that their infant Re hee

son had been taken from his crib. A ransom note, Clio, A 7

Authorities and private investigators have been

working around the clock, but the trail has remained cold, leaving the Lindberghs in a state
of anguish and uncertainty. The shocking nature of the crime has left everyone-from

to law enforcement and close friends. Anne, his wife, has been reportedly inconsolable,

desperate for the return of their son. The couple's close-knit relationship, once seen as a
model of American success, is now tested in the most unimaginable way.
