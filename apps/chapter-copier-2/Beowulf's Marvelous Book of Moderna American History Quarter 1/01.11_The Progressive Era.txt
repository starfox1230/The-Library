With all this change came problems like poor working conditions, Ge

political corruption, and a big gap between the rich and the poor

Political corruption is when people in power like government leaders or officials, use their
position to do dishonest or unfair things for their own benefit instead of helping the people they
are supposed to serve. This can include things like taking bribes, giving jobs or contracts to
friends instead of qualified people, or stealing public money.

So, in the midst of all these changes, came a period of time called the Progressive Era.

The Progressive Era, which lasted from about 1901 to 1920, was a time when people in the
U.S. worked hard to fix these problems and make life better for everyone. It was like a big
clean-up and improvement project for the whole country, but especially for the big cities.

Think of progressivism as focusing on three main goals: making the government fairer and less
corrupt, improving life by fixing problems caused by industrialization (all the factories and
such), and controlling the big companies: power

Here are some key things people called progressives worked on during the Progressive Era:

UL
o— Education

Progressives wanted fo improve education for all children. Many children of the time only
attended a few years of school, often just enough fo learn basic reading, writing, and math.
This wasnt enough to prepare them for the rapidly changing world. Some children like Paulo
didn't go to school at all, because they had to work fo help their families survive.

Most American schools at the time were in rural areas, often in one-room schoolhouses with
limited resources. Schools in the cities had more resources but were often very overcrowded.

In the early 1900s, schools focused heavily on memorizing facts and repeating information,
which didn't help kids learn to think creatively or solve problems on their own. Progressives
wanted to improve education to make it fairen more useful, and better suited to a rapidly
changing world. They pushed to lengthen the school yean provide better training for teachers,
improve school buildings, and expand the subjects taught. This included adding practical skills
and job training to help students prepare for real-life challenges.

Living Conditions

Progressives wanted to help people who lived in poon overcrowded areas of the cities. They
worked to improve housing, sanitation, and public health.

Industry

Progressives wanted fair competition between businesses. They wanted to bust up monopolies
and make things better for consumers.

@— Politics

Cities were often run by powerful political groups led by “bosses” who used bribery to stay in
control. These bosses would offer jobs, housing, and other favors to people in exchange for
their votes. This system caused widespread corruption, as politicians paid more attention to the
bosses interests instead of what the public needed.

When a politician or political party won an election, they got to pick people for government jobs.
Instead of choosing the best-qualified people, they often gave jobs to friends, supporters, or
those who helped them win. This meant many jobs went to people because of their connections,
not their skills.

Progressives fought to make politics fairer and to get rid of the corruption which was rampant
in the cities. They aimed to stop powerful bosses and businesses from controlling elections and
ensure that government jobs were given to people based on their skills and qualifications, not
favoritism.

Prohibition

Some progressives wanted to ban alcohol, which led to Prohibition in the 1920s. They said
alcohol hurt lives and families, and that it was often to blame for abuse and joblessness. They
believed that many lives would be better of f without this damaging drink.

e— Women s Rights

Progressives fought for women to have the right to vote. In the early 1900s and before,
women werent allowed to vote for several reasons. Many people believed a woman's main job
was to take care of the home and children, but it wasn't just about her time or knowledge.
Back then, many women saw their husbands as the family’s representative when it came to
politics. The idea was that the family functioned as a unit, with the husband casting a vote on

behalf of the household.

Some argued that women's votes wouldn't matter because they would just vote the same way
as their husbands or other men in their lives. Others thought women were too emotional or not
capable of understanding political issues.

Progressives believed women were just as capable as men and deserved equal rights. They
worked hard for women's suffrage, which means the right to vote, as part of their goal to
make society fairer and more democratic.

It's important to understand, though, that not all women supported the people who fought for
voting rights. Some of these activists had radical (extreme) ideas about changing traditional
family roles, and many women didn't agree with them. Some progressives even opposed
marriage and family life, which made their ideas controversial.

= Workers Rights

Progressives in the early 1700s were passionate about improving workers’ rights and ending
child labor They saw the harsh conditions many workers faced and knew things had to change.

Workers were paid very low wages, barely enough to survive. Progressives fought for fair
wages fo ensure workers could support themselves and their families.

Many workers, including children, worked long hours— sometimes 12 to 16 hours a day.
Progressives pushed for an eight-hour workday to give workers more time to rest and spend
with their families. They also fought for better safety regulations to prevent accidents and
injuries.

Wait! Whaaaaaaaaaat? Children worked? You mean like loading the )

Well, first of all, there were no automatic dishwashers in the early 1900s.
And yes, children worked at real jobs—the same as adults! Child labor was a
big issue during this time. Many children, some as young as five or six, worked
in factories, mines, and farms under terrible conditions. They often worked

the same long hours as adults, which left them exhausted and with little
time for education or play.

The jobs children did were often hazardous, too. Working with heavy machinery often led to
children losing fingers, hands, or even limbs. Little girls had their hair ripped out when it got
caught in the textile machine looms. Little boys working with hot equipment got severe burns.
Boys working in coal mines got lung diseases from breathing in air thick with coal dust deep
underground. Exposure to chemicals and flying debris in factories led to serious eye injuries,
and sometimes even blindness.

1910. The boy on the left is named Frank.

He worked a mile underground.

Long hours and physically demanding work left many children exhausted, making them more
prone to accidents and injuries. Working long hours meant children couldnt attend school,
trapping them in a cycle of poverty and limiting their future opportunities. Think of Paulo stuck
at home in the semi-dark sewing all day long. How would he be able to do anything else when this
was required for his family to survive?

Children were paid much less than adults, which made them appealing to employers. Why hire an
adult when a child could do the same work for half the price?

Progressives worked tirelessly to change these conditions. They pushed for laws to restrict

A litle spinner in the Mollohan
Mills, Newberry, S.C., 1908

One significant event that highlighted the need for reform was the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory
fire. At this factory, teenagers as young as 13 years old worked 7 days a week, in 12-hour
shifts with just a single 30-minute break. Extra bathroom breaks were not allowed, so
sometimes the girls peed on the floon When we get a bit further down the timeline, I'll tell you
more about it, and youll see how it spurred a wave of reforms (changes). But first, let’s see
how one president burst onto the scene unexpectedly and helped usher in the Progressive eral!
