JULY 1925: THE SCOPES "MONKEY" TRIAL

In March of 1925, Tennessee passed a law called the Butler Act that said public school
teachers couldn't teach anything that went against the Bible's story of how God created
humans, as described in the book of Genesis.

Some Christians believe that Genesis says that the earth was created in / literal days and
man was created on the 6th day. Here's what it says:

Genesis 1:26 Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let
them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the ain and over the cattle,
over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.” 27 So God
created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He
created them. 28 Then God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply;
fill the earth and subdue it; have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the ain
and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”

Genesis 2:18 And the Lord God said, “It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him
a helper comparable to him.” 19 Out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the
field and every bird of the ain and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them.
And whatever Adam called each living creature, that was its name. 20 So Adam gave names
to all cattle, to the birds of the ain and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was
not found a helper comparable to him.

2] And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of
his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. 22 Then the rib which the Lord God had taken

from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man.

23 And Adam said:

“This is now bone of my bones
And flesh of my flesh;

She shall be called Woman,

Because she was taken out of Man.*

Back in the 1920s, many people in the United States were Christians. Most Christians
believe that the Bible is not just a regular book, but the inerrant word of God.

Greek and Latin roots: Inerrant comes from the Latin word in meaning not and errare
meaning to wander stray, or roam. Something that is inerrant does not wander or stray

from the truth.

Most Christians believe that everything in the Bible is true and without mistakes because it is
inspired by God Himself: For Christians, the Bible is a guide for how to live, what to believe,
and how to understand the world. They believe that God guided the people who wrote the
Bible to write what they did through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and so its teachings
and stories are the truth. This is why, in the 1920s, many people thought it was important to
make sure that what was being taught in schools matched what the Bible says about things
like creation and the origins of life.

It was a blistering hot afternoon in Tennessee, and John Butler sat on the front porch of his
modest home, rocking gently in his chain trying to catch any whisper of a breeze. He'd
finished cutting the grass a few moments ago and the fresh scent lingered. His shirt was
plastered with sweat. Kermit, his son, was sitting on the steps, holding a biology textbook in
his lap. It was too hot to study inside. Kermit's face was scrunched up in frustration.

“Dad, I don't know how to say this,” Kermit said, looking up from his book, “but we are
learning things in school that go against the Bible."

John leaned forward, his hands gripping the armrests of his chain “What do you mean, son?"

Kermit stood up, holding open his book, Civic Biology: Presented in Problems. “This book says
that humans came from animals. That we evolved over millions of years from creatures like
apes!"

John had heard rumors that evolution was being taught in the schools but hearing it from his
own son made it suddenly real and quite personal. “Now, Kermit, hold on a minute, John said,
trying to keep his voice calm. “That book says the Bible is wrong?"

Kermit shook his head. “Well, it doesn't actually mention the Bible, but it completely goes
against it.”

John stood up from his chair and walked over to his son. He took a deep breath, trying to
think of how to respond.

His voice was steady and strong, “You've got to remember son, the Bible tells us the truth
about our world. It tells us God created us exactly the way we are.”

Kermit shrugged. “Yeah, but this is what scientists are saying. It talks about natural
selection, how animals change to survive, and how we came from other creatures over time.

152
If that's not true, then why are scientists believing it and why’s it being taught at school?"

John paused. “Look, Kermit, I haven't studied evolution yet, but I believe the Bible, and it’s
been guiding people for thousands of years. It says God created everything, and that

includes us. If we start believing this evolution stuff, where does it end? Next, they'll tell us
that the Bible's just a bunch of stories.”

He sat down beside his son on the steps. “Scientists dont always have everything right, and
we don't have all the answers yet to prove what we believe. It’s okay to ask questions and
look at things from different angles, but in the end, the truth will come to light, and I believe
that we are the ones who are holding onto it.”

That evening, John picked up the paper and read a similar story. In his own recorded words
from history, he stated to others, “I'd read in the papers that boys and girls were coming
home from school and telling their fathers and mothers that the Bible was all nonsense.”

Kermit's schoolbook contained information about evolution. Evolution is a scientific theory
that a man named Charles Darwin came up with in 1859. In his book The Origin of Species
and The Descent of Man, he said that all living things share common ancestors but have
evolved into different forms over millions of years. Darwin suggested that different animals
and plants came from a common ancestor and slowly changed over many generations to
become the different species we see today.

153
This was a big idea at the time because it challenged the belief that all animals and plants
were created separately. From a Biblical viewpoint, dogs can change into different breeds
like a Fox Terrier and a Golden Retrieven but they can’t turn into a new type of creature
(species). Dogs can only come from dogs and will always only be dogs, not something else.

Evolution suggests that dogs didn't come from one specific creature, but rather that they
evolved over billions of years. It says that all living things, including dogs, began as tiny, single-
celled organisms. These simple organisms slowly changed and developed into different
creatures over millions of years. These changes continued over time, leading to the animals
we see today, including dogs. Evolution also leaves open the idea that, in the future, dogs
could continue to change and evolve into something entirely different—maybe developing
wings, extra eyes, or even the ability to breathe underwater though that would take many
more millions of years.

“This is dangerous stuff,” Butler muttered
to himself, shaking his head. “If children are
being taught this, it’s no wonder they're
questioning the Bible.” He determined right
then and there to draft a law that would
stop the teaching of evolution in
Tennessee's schools. In his mind, it was
clear: teaching evolution was harmful, and
he had to do something to protect the
beliefs that so many people, including

himself, held dean

John managed to get the following law
passed, called the Butler Act:

It shall be unlawful for any teacher in any
of the Universities and all other public
schools of the State which are supported in
whole or in part by the public school funds
of the State, to teach any theory that
denies the Story of the Divine Creation of
man as taught in the Bible, and to teach
instead that man has descended from a

lower order of animals.

One man named William Jennings Bryan said to Butlen “The Christian parents of the state
owe you a debt of gratitude for saving their children from the poisonous influence of an
unproven hypothesis.

Several months after the Butler Act was passed, the small town of Dayton, Tennessee, was

154
about to become the center of a storm. It all started when a high school teacher named
John Scopes agreed to become the face of a major court battle that would challenge the
law. Scopes wasn't alone in this—he had been convinced by the ACLU (American Civil
Liberties Union) to say he had taught evolution to his students, even though it was against
the law.

Are you sure about this, John?” his friend and fellow teacher Bill, asked after Scopes told
him the plan.

“Just between you and me, I didn't even teach that chapter in the book. But I don't know if
we ll ever get another chance like this,” Scopes replied, looking at his friend with a
determined look. “I believe in
what the ACLU is doing, so I'm

g
going to say | did it.”

The town of Dayton was eager
for the attention. They thought
this could put them on the map,
and soon enough, some of the
Dayton residents helped set up
the trial. Scopes was arrested
for teaching that humans
evolved from animals, which
directly challenged the Butler
Act. The trial quickly grew into
something bigger than just one
teacher's actions—it was about
whether schools could teach

scientific ideas like evolution or if
they had to stick to the Bible's story of creation.

When the trial began, it was clear this was no ordinary case. People from all over the
country came to see the battle unfold. As Scopes walked into the courtroom, he could hear
the murmurs of reporters and spectators. “This is bigger than any one of us,” he said to
himself, bracing for what would come next.

The case became a spectacle, with the country divided. As the trial began, the courtroom
became a battleground. Clarence Darrow, the defense attorney, was calm and calculated,
determined to show that science had the right to be taught in schools. On the opposing side,
the fiery Wiliam Jennings Bryan, a former presidential candidate, and a devout Christian,

stood firm in his belief that the Bible’s creation story should be the only truth taught to
children.

“This trial is not just about one teacher” Darrow said to the court. “It’s about whether we,

155
as a society, will allow our schools to teach what science tells us, or if we will stick to old
beliefs that may not stand up to what we ve learned. *

The Scopes “Monkey” Trial, as it came to be called, wasnt just a legal fight. It was a
national debate about whether science or religion should hold sway in the classroom. As the
trial carried on, it became clear: it wasn't just about John Scopes anymore; it was about the
future of education in America.

Clarence Darrow paced back and forth; his eyes locked on William Jennings Bryan as he
fired question after question.

“Mr Bryan, you believe in the literal truth of the Bible, don't you?"
William Jennings Bryan (the prosecuton answering confidently):

“T do. The Bible is the word of God, and I believe every word in it is true.”
Darrow (leaning forward, his voice growing more intense):

“So, you believe that the story of Jonah and the whale is a true account? That a man was
swallowed by a whale and lived to tell the tale?"

Bryan (pausing, clearly uncomfortable, but trying to stay calm):

“Yes, Mr Darrow, I read that a big fish swallowed Jonah. It does not say whale. A big fish,
and I believe it, and I believe in a God who can make a fish and can make a man, can make
both do what He pleases.”

Darrow (pressing, his voice almost a challenge):

“So, you think it's perfectly reasonable that a whale could swallow a man whole, and he could
survive inside for three days? No questions asked?"

Bryan (defensive but steadfast):

“Yes, Ido. The Bible is the word of God. There are many things in the Bible that people
might not understand, but that doesn't make them less true. One miracle is just as easy to
believe as another”

Darrow (turning to the jury, gesturing with his hands):

“Ladies and gentlemen, here we are, debating the most basic science of life. The prosecutor
himself believes that a man could survive inside a whale-yet he refuses to accept the
science that tells us life on Earth evolved over millions of years. This is the battle we are

fighting!"

156
Darrow did not triumph. In the end, the jury found John Scopes guilty of violating the Butler
Act. He was fined $100, but the trial's significance went far beyond the verdict.

The Scopes Monkey Trial brought a lot of attention to the growing conflict between science
and religion in America. It made people across the country talk about what schools could and
should teach, and how they should handle controversial sub jects.

In 1967, the Butler Act was repealed (removed from law), marking the end of the ban on
teaching evolution in public schools. By that time, many, if not most, public schools and
universities had already incorporated evolution into their curriculums. In many places, it
eventually became illegal to present the origins of mankind in any other way, as religious
perspectives were kept out of schools and not even discussed as an alternative.

Today, the only way some students learn about creation vs. evolution is through religious
schools or homeschooling. There are many scientists today who believe in creation, but they
arent often mentioned in textbooks or the news. Sometimes, these scientists even face
problems or criticism for sharing research that supports creation.

Many Christians think there is good evidence to support creation, and they believe science
should be open to different ideas instead of hiding them. Scientific ideas, including evolution,
are theories, which means they arent proven facts. Real science encourages questions,
open discussion, and exploring many ideas, rather than saying one idea is completely right and
ignoring all others.
