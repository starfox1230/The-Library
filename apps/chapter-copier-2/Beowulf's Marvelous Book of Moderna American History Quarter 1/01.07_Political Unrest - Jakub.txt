Political Unrest: Jakub WEEK 1 DAY 3

Jakub Kowalski was only 12 when his life changed forever It was 1901, and like most boys his

age in the small town of WrzeSnia, Poland, he attended the local school. But school wasn’t like
it had been in the past. Poland, divided and controlled by Russia, Germany, and Austria-
Hungary, was under strict rules. Wrzesnia was in the part of Poland controlled by Germany,
and the German authorities wanted fo erase anything Polish and force everything and everyone
to be German.

One day, Jakub and his classmates received news that shocked them all: from now on, every
sub ject—including religion—would be taught only in German.

A new set of German catechisms arrived soon after this announcement. Jakub’s heart sank
when he saw the new pile of books. Polish was the language his parents and grandparents
spoke, the language of his village, and the language of his heart. He couldn't imagine a life
where Polish was completely forbidden.

Things became worse. The next morning

_ the religion teachen Herr Schultz,
~~ announced that even the prayers they

recited at the start of the day would have
to be said in German. Jakub, like many of
his classmates, was furious. Prayer was
sacred and speaking to God in any
language other than Polish felt wrong.

The next day, Jakub wasn't alone. More of
his classmates refused to do their German
religious lessons and recite German
prayers, and soon, word of this protest
spread across Wrzesnia. Parents
supported their children’s decision to stand
up for their language and their heritage.
The school became a battleground of
words and defiance. When German
officials learned of the strike, they were
furious. They decided to punish the
children to make an example out of them.

Jakub and thirteen of the other striking
students were dragged to the front of
the classroom, one by one. The teachers
began to beat them with sticks over and

oven Jakub's back stung with every blow, but he refused to cry out. His hands shook, but not
with fear—with anger How could they punish him for wanting to be Polish?

Hearing children’s screams from inside, desperate parents and concerned neighbors rushed to
the school, trying to intervene and stop the cruelty. Insults to the teachers were thrown about
and some physical fights between parents and teachers broke out. The police were called by
the school and afterwards 26 adults were put on trial for “public disturbance, preventing the
officials from carrying out their duties, trespassing, and similar crimes.” One poor woman, the
mother of 7 children, was sentenced to over 2 years in prison.

Jakub’s mother and father were furious, not just at the school but at the entire system that
was trying to erase their Polish identity. His father had always been a quiet man, but Jakub’s

flogging pushed him to the edge.

A week later his father made an announcement at the dinner table. “We're leaving,” he said
firmly. “We're going to America, where no one can tell us what language to speak or beat you
for being Polish. I've arranged our passage. We're leaving after the sale of my business is
final.” In the meantime, Jakub was ordered to stay home from school.

At the end of a few months, the Kowalski family packed up clothes, small valuables, and a few
family trinkets and boarded a ship bound for New York. They were one of the lucky immigrant
families who took with them a tidy sum of money. The journey was long and difficult, with
cramped quarters and seasickness making things nearly unbearable. The smell of unwashed
bodies and vomit seeped into every breath of air belowdecks, but the travelers tried to make
things better with little acts of kindness and sharing a bit of music in the evenings. Jakub tried
to imagine what his new life would be like, but it was hard to picture anything beyond the rolling
waves and the creaking of the ship. He'd never been more than a few miles from home. He was
both nervous and excited.

When the family finally arrived in America, it was nothing like the liHle village of WrzeSnia. The
streets of New York City buzzed with life-horses clattered down cobblestone roads, vendors
shouted in dozens of different languages, and huge crowds of people rushed to and fro. Jakub
felt overwhelmed by the noise and the size of the city, but there was something else he noticed,

too— freedom. No one cared what language he spoke or how he prayed. In America, he could
be Polish and still belong.

Jakub's family settled in a Polish neighborhood, where he attended school with other immigrant
children. They spoke Polish at home, but they also learned English, eager to fit into their new

life. Jakub never forgot the strike in Wrzesnia. The pain of being beaten for standing up for

his heritage remained with him, but it also gave him strength.

In America, Jakub felt a sense of pride whenever he heard Polish spoken on the street or saw
the Polish flag flying at a community event. He knew that his family had made the right decision.
They had escaped the repression of their homeland and found a place where they could be
free, where Jakub could grow up without fear of losing his identity, even as he combined it with
anew American one.

Even though Jakub would never return to Wrzesnia, he carried a piece of it with him always.
Later in his life, he told his children and grandchildren about the strike, about the courage of
the Polish children who refused to bow to oppression, and about how they found freedom
across the ocean.
