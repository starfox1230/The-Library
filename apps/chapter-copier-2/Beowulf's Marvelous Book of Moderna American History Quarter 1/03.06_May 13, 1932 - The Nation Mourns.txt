MAY 13, 1932: THE NATION MOURNS

After weeks of uncertainty, the Lindbergh kidnapping case has taken a tragic turn.
Yesterday, Charles Augustus Lindbergh Jr's little lifeless body was found in a wooded area
not far from the Lindbergh home. The discovery brought a wave of grief and disbelief to the
Lindbergh family. What began as a daring and hopeful search for a missing child has ended in
tragedy. The Lindberghs, who are deeply private despite their fame, could not be reached
for comment. A trusted source has shared that the famous couple has left their home and
have no plans to return.
