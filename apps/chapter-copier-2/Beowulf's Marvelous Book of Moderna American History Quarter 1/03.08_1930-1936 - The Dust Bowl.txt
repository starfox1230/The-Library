1930-1936: THE DUST BOWL WEEK 9 DAY 1

In the early 1930s, long before the country had fully recovered from the Great
Depression, a different kind of disaster began to unfold in the heart of the United States. It
wasn t caused by an economic crash or a sudden event, but by a series of harsh conditions
that combined in a perfect storm. This was the Dust Bowl, a time when the land seemed to
fight back against the people who had tried to tame it.

The story of the Dust Bowl began when the U.S. government encouraged people to settle
the Great Plains after passing the Homestead Act of 1862.

The Homestead Act was a law passed by the U.S. government during the presidency of
Abraham Lincoln. It was designed to encourage westward expansion by offering free land to

settlers willing to move to the western
frontier and cultivate it. The law granted
160 acres of public land to any adult
citizen (or intended citizen). That's about
the size of 121 American football fields.

To claim the land, settlers had to pay a
small filing fee and agree to improve the

AO A land by building a home, planting crops, and

living on the land for at least five years.
After fulfilling these conditions, the settler could claim ownership of the land. The idea was
to populate the western territories, develop them for farming, and create a strongen more
settled nation.

The Great Plains

is a vast, flat
region in North
America that
stretches across
the central
United States
and parts of
Canada. It is
characterized by
wide, open
spaces and
gently rolling
land, with few
trees and mostly
grassy areas.

The entire area is typically semi-arid, which means it's dry but not as dry as a desert. While
it receives more rain than a desert, it doesn't get enough to support many plants or crops
without additional help, such as irrigation.

The Great Plains covers parts of several U.S. states, including parts of Montana, North
Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas and the right edges of
Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico.

This area was once home to large herds of bison and Indian tribes, but it became a major
farming and ranching area after settlers moved west.

In the 1870s and 1880s, the Great Plains experienced a period of unusually wet weather It
made people think the area was getting greener and better for farming. At the time, people
didn't fully understand climate patterns, and a popular saying emerged: “rain follows the
plow.” According to this theory, scientists believed that plowing the soil for farming released
moisture into the ain which caused rain to follow. This belief was based on the idea that
farming and human
settlement could
permanently change the
weathen

It seemed to make sense!
Before the Homestead
Act, the Great Plains
were much drier and more
arid. After people began

land, suddenly there was a

grass exploded across the
region!

In the early 1900s, the

U.S. government started giving out even larger parcels of land to settlers. In some areas,
you could get 320 acres or more for free! Remember how the country was flooded with
immigrants in the early 1900s? Many of them moved out to the plains. Imagine what it was

188
like for a family from Europe who couldn't afford land in their home country, If they moved to
the U.S., they could claim hundreds of acres for nothing but a filing fee. It was an incredible
opportunity.

When World War 1 broke out, the price of wheat soared due to a global shortage of grain.
European countries, heavily affected by the wan needed huge amounts of wheat to feed
their troops and populations. As a result, wheat became a highly profitable crop. The U.S.
government, eager To support the war effort, encouraged
wee». farmers to produce as much wheat as

possible, even using slogans like “Win the
War with Wheat" to rally support.

Farmers flocked to the Great Plains,
hoping to make their fortunes by growing

wheat. The land was now seen as a fertile
opportunity,

As more and more people moved west and
plowed up the land, something started to
go wrong. By the late 1920s, farmers
had been working the land intensely. They
planted wheat on huge stretches of

land, often using plows that dug deep

into the soil. As they plowed, they dug

In 1930, along drought, lasting for years, settled over the region. The once-strong rains
that had nurtured crops became rare. Some areas went for years with less than 10 inches

The crops were ruined. Wheat fields, once lush and golden, were now dead. The soil
already weakened from over-

farming, dried out and turned into a lifeless powden

189
Then, the strong winds that once blew
through the plains were now sweeping
across miles of bare, dusty earth.
Without the cover of grass, the soil
was picked up by the wind and blown
into massive clouds of dust.

As the drought continued, the region
became a giant, dry desert, and the
winds turned the land into something
unrecognizable. The dust storms,
known as ‘black blizzards,” were
enormous. The sky would turn dark

and ominous, and a thick cloud of dirt would pour in, blocking out the sun. People could barely
see in front of them, and the dust would cover everything—homes, fields, crops, and even

inside houses.

Farmers tried everything
they could think of to

save their fields and stop the dust from ruining everything. Some dug trenches to hold every
drop of precious rainfall, others planted trees to act as windbreaks, and still others tried to
cover the soil with a special type of grass. For most, it was a losing battle.

On May 9, 1934, a two-day dust storm of epic proportions swept across the Great Plains.
This was one of the worst storms of the Dust Bowl era, stripping vast amounts of topsoil
from the parched earth. Dust clouds, billowing high into the sky, traveled as far east as
Chicago, where a staggering 12 million pounds (5,400 tonnes) of dust settled on the city.

190
Two days laten the storm's relentless march continued, reaching cities along the East Coast,
including Cleveland, Buffalo, Boston, New York City, and Washington, D.C. Iconic landmarks
like the Statue of Liberty and the U.S. Capitol were completely obscured by the dense haze.
The fine dust particles penetrated even the most tightly sealed homes, settling on food,
furniture, and the people inside. Hair was gritty with dust. Dust coated the surface of the
glass of water or milk set out for lunch.

That winter the skies over New England even saw red snow fall, a grim reminder of the far-
reaching effects of the Dust Bowl.

On April 14, 1935, on a day known as “Black Sunday,” a relentless onslaught of 20 “black
blizzards" swept over the Great Plains. This environmental catastrophe, one of the most
severe during the Dust Bowl era, stretched from the Canadian border to the southern
reaches of Texas. The storms, with their ominous, dark and billowing black clouds,
transformed day into night, reducing visibility to a mere five feet. For a terrifying moment,
the darkness was so absolute that you couldn't even see your own hand stretched out.
Eyewitnesses recounted the eerie sensation of being shrouded in darkness. It was as if a
black fog descended over everything.

One reporter wrote:

‘Ever since Friday of last week, there hasn't been a day pass but what the county was
besieged with a blast of wind and dirt. On rare occasions when the wind did subside for a

191
period of hours, the air has been so filled with dust that the town appeared to be overhung
by a fog cloud.

Because of this long siege of dust and every building being filled with it, the air has become
stifling to breathe, and many people have developed sore throats and dust colds as a result.”
