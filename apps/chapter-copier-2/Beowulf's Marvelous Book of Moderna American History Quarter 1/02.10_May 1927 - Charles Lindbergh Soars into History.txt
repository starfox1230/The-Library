MAY 1927: CHARLES LINDBERGH SOARS INTO
HISTORY

A couple of years laten
another historic event was
splashed across the
newspaper headlines.
Charles Lindbergh, a
dashing airmail pilot, was
getting ready fo try his
hand at claiming a
$25,000 prize (worth
about $453,000 in
2024) that had been
offered by a group of
wealthy businessmen for
the first successful nonstop
solo flight across the
Atlantic Ocean, from New
York to Paris.

157
Several other aviators had tried with no luck. One man crashed during takeoff Another was
killed while testing a new plane. Yet another had disappeared while flying somewhere in the
Atlantic, never to be seen again.

The flight was incredibly dangerous. Flying solo across the Atlantic at that time was a daring
feat, with the odds stacked against any pilot brave enough to attempt it.

Airplanes in the late 20s were still relatively new, and while aviation had made great strides,
the technology was far from perfect. The Spirit of St. Louis, Charles Lindbergh's custom-
built plane, was designed specifically for the journey, but it was still untested in such extreme
conditions. With no backup systems or modern tools, a single malfunction could mean disaster

Besides the risks involved with the airplane, navigating the vast ocean was another huge
challenge! Back then pilots relied on dead reckoning and basic instruments, with no GPS or
radio beacons to guide them. The weather was unpredictable, and flying through storms,
fog, or high winds could make the journey even more perilous. The biggest fean though, was
running out of fuel.

Lindbergh's plane was fitted with extra fuel tanks, but there was always the risk of
miscalculating how much was left, with no land in sight for hours. And once in the ain there
was no help to be found. No radio communications, no emergency landings, just the endless
stretch of water beneath the sky. Despite these enormous risks, Lindbergh pressed on with
unwavering courage, knowing that if he succeeded in flying across the Atlantic, he would not
only make history but also claim a hefty prize of $25,000!

Lindbergh stepped onto the runway; his confident face already familiar to the hundreds
gathered around Roosevelt Field. At just 25, he had the appearance of someone much
younger—tall and lean, with his blonde hair damp and ruffled from the rain. He approached
the Spirit of St. Louis, the plane that would carry him on his historic solo flight across the
Atlantic, for a final inspection.

Hundreds of people stood packed togethen eagerly waiting to witness one of the greatest
moments in aviation history. Many had arrived as early as midnight, determined to secure a
choice spot and not miss a single moment of the excitement. Even so, the unrelenting rain
had chased away many of them. Now, on this cloudy, wet morning, about 500 people
remained, ignoring their soaking feet and damp clothes, all eager to watch the plane and his
pilot take to the skies. A murmur broke out as they noticed Lindbergh walking confidently and
waving.

A sliver of the plane's silver nose peeked through a crack in the hangar doon wet from the
rain and gleaming, the color mirroring the clouds above. Lindbergh moved toward it
purposefully, nearly bouncing with excitement.

“You ready to go?" one of the mechanics called out to Charles, watching closely as the last

158
drops of the 450 gallons of fuel filled the tanks.

Lindbergh turned to him with a steady look. “As ready as I'll ever be. Just make sure
everything is tight. There's no turning back once I'm in the ain”

With steady hands, he climbed into the cockpit of the Spirit of St. Louis and started the
motor After letting it idle for a moment, he pushed the throttle forward, and the engine
roared to life. The plane shook and vibrated beneath him, the powerful hum of the motor
filing the ain

Frank Tichenon the editor of an airplane digest, waved up pat + him laughing "Ts it true you are
only taking five sandwiches?"

"Yes," smiled Lindbergh. “That's enough. If I get to Paris, I won't need anymore, and if I
don't get to Paris, I won't need any more eithen”

Lindbergh's mechanic approached and his presence interrupted the conversation.
“Well, how is it?” the young pilot asked.

“She sounds good to me,” replied the mechanic.

“Well, then, I might as well go,” answered Lindbergh.

The blocks were removed from beneath the wheels, and the engine roared to life as the

159
heavy plane slowly began to move forward. It felt agonizingly slow. The wet runway made
the wheels sink into the mud, and halfway down the stretch, the plane jolted and bounced,
its wings tipping dangerously from side to side. Lindbergh gripped the controls, struggling to
lift the plane into the ain The spectators stood in anxious silence, their faces tense, groaning
and wringing their hands as they watched the tense battle for lift-off

With a sudden surge, the plane lifted off the ground, barely clearing the telephone lines, but
it was airborne and gaining speed!

Then, the long and grueling flight began. As the Spirit of St. Louis sliced through the clouds,
Lindbergh faced fierce winds, waves of exhaustion, and the constant struggle to keep his
mind focused. He had to fight of f sleep and remain alert for any sudden changes in the
weather

At one point, the engine sputtered, sending a jolt through the plane. Lindbergh's heart
raced. “Stay with me my bright and shiny girl,” he whispered, gently pulling back on the
controls. “You're not letting me down now.”

Hours passed, and the vast Atlantic stretched endlessly beneath him. In the small, cramped
cockpit, Lindbergh kept his eyes on the horizon. He didn't know how to navigate by the sun
and stars, so he did so by dead reckoning. Radio equipment would have been too heavy to
take. He calculated his course using a combination of tools such as a compass, a stopwatch,
and a chart to estimate his speed and direction. By carefully tracking the time he had been
flying and how fast he was going, Lindbergh could ad just his course, even though the vast
expanse of the ocean offered no clear reference points. This required immense focus and
precision, as even a small error in time or speed could lead to going astray.

As night fell, the stars began to emerge, but the sea quickly disappeared beneath a thick
and blanketing fog. Lindbergh pushed the little plane higher until he rose above the clouds. An

hour later he was soaring at 10,000 feet. Ahead of him, a towering thunderhead loomed.
He flew into the cloud, but a dangerous situation began to unfold. The temperature dropped
rapidly, and when Lindbergh thrust his bare hand through the cockpit window, he felt the

sharp sting of ice particles. He would have to turn back.

Ice on the wings was a serious threat for any pilot, but especially on such a long and high-
stakes flight. The build-up of ice not only added extra weight to the plane, making it harder
to control, but it also disrupted the smooth flow of air over the wings— airflow that was
critical for keeping the plane aloft. With ice clinging to the surface, the wings could lose that
vital lift, making it much harder to
stay in the ain The extra weight
of the ice was also making the
plane heavien

Charles circled the plane around
to a clearer and warmer sky.
Once he found it, the ice that had
been building on the Spirit of St.
Louis thankfully melted away.
Eighteen hours into the flight, he
was halfway to Paris, but instead
of the excitement he had
expected all he felt was dread.

“Just keep going,” he muttered to

himself. “Halfway there. Do or
die.”

The hours seemed to stretch
endlessly. As Lindbergh crossed
multiple time zones, dawn arrived
earlier than expected, around
2:52 AM. By 4:00 AM, the
fatigue began to take a toll on
him. His eyelids felt heavy, and
soon he found himself dozing off repeatedly, waking up moments laten disoriented and
groggy. The night before the flight, he'd only managed a couple of hours of sleep, the
excitement buzzing through him. Now, that lack of rest was catching up, and he fought to
stay awake, his eyelids heavy as he struggled to keep the plane steady and aloft.

“What have I gotten myself into?” Lindbergh thought, trying to shake of f the overwhelming
exhaustion. His body and mind, worn down by the endless hours in the air and the lack of
sleep, began to betray him.

161
His vision started to blun and before he knew it, he was seeing things. At one point, he swore
he saw another airplane flying alongside him, perfectly matching his speed. The image was so
clear that he even thought he could make out the shadow of the plane on his wing.

As the hours stretched on, his fatigue deepened, and soon he began to see people appearing
inside the cockpit with him, though he knew they weren't real. They weren't there.

With a steadying breath, Lindbergh reminded himself that it was all in his mind. Somewhere in
the fog of his tired brain, he recognized the hallucinations for what they were. But despite
the tricks his mind was playing, he pushed on, determined fo finish the journey ahead.

At 9:52 AM New York time, 27 hours after taking off from Roosevelt Field, Lindbergh saw
the first signs of land— “porpoises and fishing boats’ —and with them, the realization that he
had crossed the Atlantic. His heart raced.

A new energy filled him as he circled the area to get a closer look. A face peeped at him
from a boat's porthole. Lindbergh checked his charts and confirmed what he'd suspected—
he had reached Dingle Bay in County Kerry, Ireland. It was 3:00 PM local time, and he had
arrived with remarkable precision. The Spirit of St. Louis was 2.5 hours ahead of schedule
and only a few miles of f course.

Lindbergh, now fully awake, pushed the plane to 110 miles per hour eager to reach the
French coast in daylight. Soon, the English coast appeared ahead of him, and news reports
were already coming in from Plymouth, England, confirming that he was over the English
Channel. The crowd at Le Bourget Aerodrome in Paris was starting to gathen waiting for
the historic arrival.

After 33 and a half
hours Lindbergh
approached Paris.
The lights of the city
grew brighten and
finally, the Eiffel
Tower came into
view. At 10:22 PM,
he landed at Le
Bourget Field.

A crowd of
150,000 people
stormed the field,
dragged Lindbergh
out of the cockpit
and carried him

162
above their heads cheering and shouting. Souvenir hunters stripped the plane of everything
they could pull of f, even going so far as to cut pieces of linen cloth off the frame.

The police and a squad of soldiers with bayonets fixed to their rifles quickly surrounded the
plane to protect it. The crowd continued to carry Lindbergh around screaming, and shouting,
and laughing. Their spirits seemed to soar to the same heights the plane had reached.
Charles Lindbergh was an instant global hero!

Once he finally got to bed that night, happy and exhausted, Lindbergh had been up for 63
hours straight.

In the words of biographer A. Scott Berg, people were “behaving as though Lindbergh had
walked on water not flown over it’.

Suddenly the entire nation was struck with Lindbergh feven “Lucky Lindy” was adored and
celebrated. He attended countless ceremonies, banquets, parades, and awards, with some
attended by over 4 million people jostling to get a glance of the now famous aviator At least
200 songs were written about him. Back in Harlem, Jimmy and his friends danced the Lindy
Hop in his honor Lucy's friend Dorothy in New York joined the other millions of girls who
wrote the handsome bachelor love letters. Lindbergh's face appeared on toys, buttons,
wrappers and labels of every kind, spoons, cups, and coins.

After this moment (in the words of the aviator Elinor Smith Sullivan), *..after Lindbergh,
suddenly everyone wanted to fly, and there weren't enough planes to carry them.”
