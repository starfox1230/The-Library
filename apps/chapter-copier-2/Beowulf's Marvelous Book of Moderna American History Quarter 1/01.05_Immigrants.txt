immigrants who were new to the
country also poured into cities looking for jobs and a place to call home. Between 1900 and
1915, more than 15 milion immigrants arrived. In 1910, three-fourths of New York City's
population were either immigrants or first-generation Americans (in other words: the sons and
daughters of immigrants).

Immigrants were people who left their home countries, often to escape famine, failed crops,
rising taxes, and fo buy land (due fo land shortages in their home country). Some people were
fleeing religious persecution and political unrest. For others, it was simply in hopes of economic
opportunity—a place to get a job, earn some money, escape poverty, and make a better life.

It's easy to read the words religious persecution, political unrest, and economic opportunity
without those things meaning much in our minds. Why would people risk everything and start a
new life in a new country with sometimes nothing more than the clothes on their backs? Why
were there literally millions of immigrants pouring into the cities and countryside of America?
