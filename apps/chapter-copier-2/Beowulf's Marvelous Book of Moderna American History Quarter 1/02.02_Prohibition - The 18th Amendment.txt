PROHIBITION: THE 18TH AMENDMENT WEEK 6 DAY 1

Greek and Latin roots: Prohibit comes from the Latin word pro meaning away and habere
meaning to hold. If you prohibit something, you hold it away (where it can't be accessed).

Imagine this: One day the government bans sugan No more candy bars, sodas, cookies, or
even ketchup, flavored yogurt, granola bars, or peanut butter The idea is to make people
healthien but people aren't exactly thrilled. Almost overnight, a “Sugar Prohibition’ changes
daily life.

Suddenly, grocery stores have empty shelves where the sweets and sodas once sat, and
your favorite corner bakery gets boarded up.

People become desperate to get their sugar fix!

People start talking in hushed voices about “sweet rooms,” hidden spots where you can go to
satisfy your sugar cravings. Only a select few know the locations, and to get in, you need a
password.

“Did you hear about the sweet room in town?” whispers Sam to his wife Mia as they walk the
dog, looking around to make sure the neighbors aren't being nosey again.

“Sweet room? You mean, like for candy?” Mia asks, eyes wide.

“Yessssssss! They have everything—chocolate bars, gummy bears, even sugar packets you
can take home to use for baking! You just say ‘Sugar Rush’ at the door’

The two make plans to head there in the evening.

People who can't find these hidden sugar spots start making their own sweets at home,
selling them in back alleys or trading them for other things. In some places, sugar smuggling
becomes a big deal, with people sneaking candy and sodas across
@ the borders from Canada and Mexico. A new kind of “sugar cartel’
KY emerges, and they make a lot of money supplying illegal sweets to
\
y eager buyers. The smugglers start fighting among themselves,
shooting each other to take over territory and hurting innocent
people in the process.

Without sugan birthday parties and holidays feel strange. Cakes and cookies are replaced
by healthier—but less exciting— alternatives, and lots of people start to grumble about the
new, sugarless world they live in.

“This is the worst!” says Mia. “My birthday’s next week, and Aunt Sherril says she’s making
me a broccoli cake.”

“Broccoli cake? Ugh,” Sam says, wrinkling his nose. "We have to do something about this. ”

A world without sugar leaves people desperate for a taste of sweetness, and soon,
underground markets, secret recipes, and hidden “sweet spots” spring up, making life during
“Sugar Prohibition’ a strange mix of strict rules and rebellious indulgence.

That is what happened in 1920, but with alcoholl

Before we dive into Prohibition and the 18th Amendment, let's talk about why some people
were (and still are) so strongly against drinking. Today, we know more about the science

2 @ a : ees off a chain reaction in the brain and
ae body. Alcohol is a depressant, which
- means it slows down how the brain

works by changing chemicals called
neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters
send messages between nerve cells, helping control how we move, think, and feel. Alcohol
raises a brain chemical called dopamine, which gives us a “feel-good” signal. It's similar to the
happiness you feel when scoring a goal or getting a compliment, which is why people
sometimes feel happy when they drink.

But here's the catch: when people overuse alcohol, their brain becomes dependent on it to
trigger the chemical that creates good feelings. It's like using training wheels on a bike for
too long and never learning to balance on your own. Over time with repeated abuse, this can
lead to mood swings, sadness, and anxiety. In extreme cases, long-term heavy drinking can
even shrink brain tissue, making it more difficult to focus, remember things, and make sound
decisions.

Alcohol's effects don't stop at the brain. The liven the body's
natural filter works hard to process alcohol. Drinking too
much over a long period of time overloads the liven leading to
fat buildup (fatty liver disease), swelling, or scarring that
makes it harder for the liver to function properly. The heart
can also be affected. Excessive drinking can raise blood
pressure and weaken the heart muscle, making it
harder to pump blood.

Another problem with alcohol is that when it's
broken down, it creates a chemical called
acetaldehyde, which can damage DNA-the
instruction manual for our cells. This can
increase the risk of cancer in places like the
mouth, throat, and liver

chronic disorder where a person struggles

to control their drinking despite negative
consequences) can change how someone acts,

With all this in mind, many people choose to drink alcohol in moderation and don't experience
negative consequences from it. In many cultures, alcohol is a common part of social
gatherings, celebrations, and religious traditions. It is often enjoyed responsibly at weddings,

Because alcohol affects people differently, individuals must make informed and responsible
choices based on their own health, beliefs, and circumstances. While some choose fo drink in
moderation, others may avoid it altogether due to personal, medical, cultural, or religious
reasons.

For those who choose to use it in moderation, the decision of whether to drink or not is best
left to adults who are fully developed and capable of making informed choices about their
health and well-being. The real issue isn't alcohol itself, it’s the lack of self-control, wisdom,
and moderation that can lead to harmful consequences when alcohol use is irresponsible or
abused. Perhaps this is why the temperance movement failed in the end (as you will see)!
Instead of focusing on helping people learn values promoting self-control, the temperance
movement treated alcohol itself as the bad thing, thinking that if they got rid of it, it would
solve everyone's problems. Spoiler alert: It didn't!

Learning to make wise choices not just about clcohol but about all areas of life, is what
truly leads to a healthy and balanced future. —

While the story about banning sugar at the beginning of this section was silly, the
temperance movement had real concerns about the impact of alcohol on society. At that
time, many Americans were focused on improving life for everyone by creating safer
workplaces, ensuring clean food, and helping working families. The temperance movement
saw banning alcohol as another step toward creating a healthier happier society.

Members of the movement, many of them women, saw alcohol as the cause of family
struggles, poverty, and violence. They argued that people who drank too much were more
likely to lose their jobs, spend all their money on alcohol, and hurt their families.

To them, Prohibition was a way to build a
society where people wouldn't suffer from
these alcohol-related issues—a society they
hoped would be healthier and more moral.

I, speakeasies and organized crime during
Prohibition.
1 3 The efforts of the temperance movement
paid off when, in 1919, Congress passed the
18th Amendment. They also passed the
National Prohibition Act (nicknamed the
Volstead Act after Andrew Volstead, the
congressman who worked hard to push it
through Congress). This act was a law to
enforce the new Amendment. The states
ratified the new amendment in 1920. Now it
was illegal to make, sell, or transport alcoholic
drinks in the United States. People call it
“Prohibition,” because it prohibited (or
banned) alcohol. The whole country was about
to change, but not in the ways the
temperance movement had hoped.

_ TALKS

At first, many people were excited about
Prohibition. They thought it would bring peace and happiness to their communities. But soon,
people realized that just because something was illegal didnt mean everyone would stop doing it.
In fact, a lot of people didnt want to give it up at all. People who wanted to drink started finding
secret ways to get alcohol. Hidden bars called “speakeasies" popped up all over cities.
Speakeasies got their name because people would only talk about them softly in public to avoid
attracting attention from the police or nosy neighbors. Speakeasies were also sometimes called
blind tigers, because they often pretended to be different kinds of businesses to avoid being
caught by the police.

Speakeasies ranged from lavish and sophisticated clubs, decorated with crystal chandeliers and
plush couches, to shadowy backrooms, cluttered apartments, and damp basements illuminated
by the flickering light of a single bulb. By 1925, there were anywhere from 30,000 to
100,000 speakeasy clubs in New York City alone.

To get in a speakeasy, you of ten needed to know a password or have a secret knock. Inside,
people gathered to drink, dance, and listen to jazz music in dimly lit and smoke-filled rooms. It
was all very hush-hush, and quite illegal!

Competition among speakeasies was fierce. To attract patrons, these hidden bars needed
something special. Live jazz music was the perfect answen The energetic rhythms and soulful
melodies of jazz filled these secret clubs, making them the place to be. The night was filled with
lively music, dancing, and forbidden liquor

129
The rise of jazz didnt just set the stage for partying; it changed the way people connected
with each other Speakeasies became more than secret drinking spots—they turned into
social hubs where people made new friends and found romance. For the first time the word
“dating” became a concept. Young people began to sneak into these clubs without the
watchful eyes of their parents, embracing the newfound freedom that came with the era.

Before the 1920s, finding a boyfriend or girlfriend was a pretty serious business! Families
had a major say in who their kids could consider as a future spouse, which meant that young
couples often had to stick to arranged visits. Young people had to be on their best behavior
while a parent or chaperone watched their every move. There were lots of strict rules
about how boys and girls could interact, and many times, young people were expected to
marry someone their families chose for them. Relationships were usually taken very
seriously right from the beginning.

But everything changed after World War 1. When the soldiers came back home, everyone
was ready to break free and have some fun after all the tough times. The economy was
booming, and people had more cash to spend as well as extra free time to enjoy life. Thanks
to the rise of the automobile, young people could drive around, exploring new places together
without anyone watching over them.

Now, couples were heading out for dinner hitting the dance floon or sneaking into
speakeasies to soak up the boozy nightlife. The idea of

dating became associated with having fun, exploring
romantic interests, and enjoying each other's
company without the immediate pressure to get
married.

Even though dating became more popular in

the 1920s, not everyone was on board with
this new way of finding love. Many parents

and older generations were concerned

about the changes they saw in young people's
social lives. They thought that the casual dating
scene could lead to trouble and that it
encouraged behaviors of which they didn't
approve.

For starters, traditional Bible- based values
were still strong, and many people believed
that relationships should be serious and lead to
marriage. They were worried that dating, with its
more relaxed rules, might make young people forget
about the importance of commitment. Parents often

thought that if their children were allowed to date freely,
130
they might get distracted from their responsibilities or make poor choices. Some parents
feared that young people might feel compelled to date simply to fit in with their friends,
rather than forming genuine connections. The idea of “dating for fun" was a big shift from
the old-fashioned view of courtship, which was much more focused on finding a lifelong
partner

Moreover the rise of jazz music and nightlife culture, which often included drinking and
dancing in speakeasies, was believed to lead to risky behavior or influence young people
negatively. Ironically, that’s one of the reasons why the temperance movement had worked
so hard to make it illegal! WEEK JEM

The culture was changing and in the middle of all of this, a new type of criminal emerged.
People called "bootleggers” (who were like alcohol smugglers) began sneaking alcohol into the
country or making it in secret locations. They smuggled alcohol in creative ways, hiding
bottles in fake books, under car seats, and even in hollowed-out loaves of bread. These
bootleggers became quite famous, and some even became very rich and powerful.

This trick became so common that the term "bootlegger” started being used to describe
anyone who made, sold, or transported alcohol illegally. During Prohibition, it was used as a
term to describe the people who made and sold alcohol illegally.

hidden for centuries was inside the top part of a tall boot. The term
"boot-leg,” referring to the leg of a tall boot, has been used since the
17th century and was commonly in use during the mid-1800s. Inthe 4

late 1800s, people would secretly carry flasks of alcohol in their a
boots to avoid getting caught.

Today, the term “bootleg” still means something unauthorized, but it’s mostly used to

13]
describe unlicensed, illegal, or
fake copies of media like movies,
music, or clothing. Here's a
modern use of the word
“bootleg’:

In fashion, ‘bootleg’ refers to
fake or imitation versions of
popular clothing, shoes, or
accessories. People might say
they bought a “bootleg” pair of
shoes, meaning they're fake or
imitation versions of popular
brands. For example, if someone
buys a pair of inexpensive shoes
that look exactly like an
expensive brand but were made
by someone else without
permission, these are called
"bootleg" shoes.

So, whether it's music, movies, fashion, or games, “bootleg” means something that was
copied or made without permission and isnt considered the real deal. Note that bootlegging
items is often something that's illegal. During Prohibition, though, the word was used mostly
when talking about alcohol.

Prohibition didn't stop people from drinking—it just pushed it into the shadows. The
government tried to catch the bootleggers and shut down the speakeasies, but it was a
tough job. The more they tried to enforce the law,
the more people found sneaky ways to break it. It
was like a giant game of cat and mouse!

Gangsters like Al Capone (who operated in Chicago)
saw an opportunity and started making big money
from bootlegging. Capone's favorite response to
questions about his illegal activities was: “Iam just a
businessman, giving the people what they want.”

Organized crime grew as different groups fought
for control. Gangsters created underground
networks to supply speakeasies with alcohol, and
soon there were organized machine-gun ambushes .
and shootouts, as feuds (fights) over territory 8 16 ae

establishment that refused to purchase liquor from Capone often got blown up, and as many
as 100 people were killed in such bombings. Overall, crime rose 24% during this time!
Bootleggers paid huge amounts of money to corrupt police officers and government officials
to look the other way and not arrest them.

Gangsters weren't the only dangen homemade alcohol, sometimes called ‘rotgut” led to
deaths by alcohol poisoning. To stop bootleggers from using industrial alcohol to make illegal
drinks, the federal government decided that it needed to be made undrinkable. They added
chemicals that made the alcohol taste bad or even poisonous. The bootleggers found a way
around this problem by hiring chemists who could take those bad chemicals out, making the
alcohol drinkable again.

In response, the Treasury Department required manufacturers to add even more
dangerous and deadly chemicals to the alcohol. Up to 10,000 people died after drinking this
denatured alcohol. Some of the people who didn't die went permanently blind.

Charles Norris, the chief medical examiner of New York City said:

" .. Fhe government knows it is not stopping drinking by putting poison in alcohol. It knows what
the bootleggers are doing with it and yet it continues its poisoning process, heedless of the
fact that people determined to drink are daily absorbing that poison. Knowing this to be true,
the United States Government must be charged with the moral responsibility for the deaths
that poisoned liquor causes.”

Llama McRama translation service:

The government puts poison in alcohol even though they know it doesn t
stop people from drinking it. They are responsible for the poisoning
deaths caused by this alcohol!

Poorly made alcohol tasted awful, so speakeasies combined it with things like ginger ale and
Coca-Cola, sugan mint, and fruit juices, creating what is now known as the ‘cocktail’ or
mixed drink.

Companies also found obvious ways to sidestep the law, actively encouraging people to make
their own alcohol at home. One example was a company that shipped packages of grapes to
people all over the country. On the package of grapes it stated: “After dissolving the brick in
a gallon of water do not place the liquid in a jug away in the cupboard for twenty days,
because then it would turn into wine.” Of course, that was put on the label with a “wink and a
nod” knowing full well that people would turn it into wine. The package just gave the
instructions on how to do sol

Some of the packages of grapes were ibe E t uni rad

labeled with the names of wine flavors they A Weekly for Everybody

There was an immediate surge in demand
for grapes (so that people could turn them
into wine at home). The price for a ton of
grapes skyrocketed from $9.50 to $375
in 1924. An average sized vineyard at the
time would make around at least 2 million
dollars or more in U.S. dollars (as of

2024).

The Duke of Windsor visiting Canada,
wrote the following after returning home:

|| This magazine cover shows someone
E ~=making homemade wine during Prohibition.

‘When I arrived home my fathen who had DELMAR + PALMER + DUGANNE ~- GREEN - WODEHOUSE

never been to the United States, asked me

innumerable questions about various American phenomena - the height of New York's
skyscrapers, the number of automobiles on the streets, the state of President Wilson's
health...but most of all he was curious about life in America under prohibition. An abstemious
man, himself, he considered it an outrage for the government of any country to attempt to
regulate the conduct of its citizens in such a manner And of all the information which I
brought back I think what delighted him most was the following doggerel (funny poem) picked
up in a Canadian border town:

Four and twenty Yankees, feeling very dry,
Went across the border to get a drink of rye.
When the rye was opened, the Yanks began to sing.

God bless America, but God save the King!”

Greek and Latin roots: Abstemious comes from the Latin word ab meaning off or away from
and temetum meaning strong drink. Apparently, the king of England (the Duke's father) at
the time generally stayed away from strong drinks with alcohol.

In the little rhyme the prince quoted, it is talking about Americans who went over the border
into Canada to get rye whiskey which was illegal in the U.S. due to Prohibition. Canada is part
of the British Commonwealth, which includes countries that were once part of the British
Empire. Although these countries are now independent, they still maintain a special

134
connection to one another and the British monarch serves as their symbolic head. This is
why the Americans sang “God save the King” while they were in Canada - as if they were
celebrating the king due to the accessibility of alcohol in “his” country.

People started to realize that Prohibition wasnt working as they had hoped. Instead of
solving problems, it was creating new ones.
