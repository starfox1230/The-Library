JUNE 4, 1919: THE 19TH AMENDMENT —- ALMOST
THERE...

As the biggest battle of all ended, the battle for women’s rights also headed toward closure.
During World War 1, a group of women in America were fighting a different kind of battle—

one for their right to vote. These women, known as suffragists, had been working tirelessly
for decades to earn the right granted to their husbands, fathers, and brothers to influence
the law of the land.

Women had been pushing for voting rights since the 1800s, but by the time World War 1
began, their fight took on a new urgency and purpose. While American men were of f
fighting in the trenches of Europe, women stepped up to keep the country running. They
took on jobs that were previously considered “men’s work’ —they worked in factories, drove
streetcars, and even worked in the government. Some women went overseas and served as
nurses or switchboard operators.

Switchboard operators connected important calls across battlefields and between military
offices. Here's how it worked: when someone needed to make a call, they'd use a telephone
connected to a switchboard: a large panel with rows of plugs and wires. The Hello Girls (as

like
the operators were nicknamed) would answer the
call, ask for the destination, and then plug in the
right wires to connect the caller to the correct
location. They had to be incredibly fast and
accurate, sometimes managing dozens of calls at
once, and often spoke both English and French to
connect with soldiers and officers in France.

The dedicated efforts of women during wartime led
many Americans to recognize that women could
successfully take on roles traditionally dominated by
men, proving their abilities in areas such as industry
and manufacturing. While women’s contributions

have always been essential and valuable, like in the Back our
home, on farms, and in countless other areas, dirls over there
wartime service highlighted their capabilities in new United War Work Campaign
ways. Despite their significant contributions to the

nation's success during the wan women still lacked

the basic right fo participate in their country’s elections.

In 1917, women’s rights activists decided it was time to take a bold stand. A group called the
National Woman's Party (NWP), led by Alice Paul, organized picket lines outside the White
House. They held up banners that read, "Mr President, how long must women wait for
liberty?” Rain or shine, they stood there, sometimes even facing angry crowds. One woman

shouted at the passing traffic, “Americans are fighting for democracy abroad, but restrict
it at home!"

Some of the protesters were arrested and thrown in prison for “obstructing traffic, ° so
then they went on hunger strikes to make their voices heard. Prison guards held some of

Although it may be difficult to imagine today, the issue of women’s right to vote was a really
controversial issue at the time. Many people opposed women’s voting rights because they
believed women’s primary roles were within the home, centered around family and household
responsibilities. However others believed that women could also actively participate in politics
from their homes while still Fulfilling traditional roles. Many people said to just let a husband
represent his wife and family with his vote, while some worried that allowing women to vote
would disrupt family harmony, thinking that wives might vote differently from their husbands
and create fights between them. People at the time also argued that voting and politics
were ‘too harsh’ for women and that they were naturally more suited to the roles of caring
and nurturing. Leave the arguing to men!

Some people even argued that women couldn't understand politics well enough to make good
decisions, and that women were ‘too emotional’ or “not rational” enough for voting. This
idea was based on a stereotype-or fixed idea—that had been around for a long time.

Greek and Latin roots: Rational comes from the Latin word rationalis meaning belonging to
reason. Reason comes from the Latin word ratus, meaning to think. Someone who is rational
has the ability to think things through with clear thoughts. Women in the early 1900s had
the stereotype of being irrational and making decisions based on their feelings instead of
logic.

Some women argued that they were already involved in their communities and were active in
groups that helped children, fought for better working conditions, and pushed for healthier
safer cities. They said they had the skills and knowledge to make good decisions and deserved
the right to vote just like anyone else.

President Woodrow Wilson initially wasn't convinced that women’s suffrage was necessary,
but in 1918 he was facing a difficult reelection and realized he was going to have to confront
the issue and decide one way or another Fifteen states had already extended equal voting
rights to women, and so the President decided to fully support the amendment proposed to
give women the vote.

In a dramatic, unprecedented (never done before) move, President Wilson took to the
Senate floon With the weight of the war pressing down on the nation, he delivered a
powerful, stirring appeal. He looked around the room, challenging the senators with a
question that cut straight to the heart:

‘Are we alone to ask and take the utmost that women can give, service and sacrifice of
every kind, and still say that we do not see what title that gives them to stand by our sides in
the guidance of the affairs of their nation and ours? We have made partners of the women
in this war; shall we admit them only to a partnership of sacrifice and suffering and toil and

"Is it fair for us to ask women to sacrifice and serve but not allow them
to help guide our nation? Women are our partners in this wan Shouldn't
they be partners in the right to vote?"

Wilson's words hung in the ain urging the lawmakers to see women as equals, deserving not
just of the burdens they'd borne for the nation, but of the rights and privileges that came

with true citizenship.

Congress debated the issue fiercely, with supporters fighting to convince every last voten

states for ratification. ‘WEEK 5 DAY 3
