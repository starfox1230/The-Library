=o Once upon a time, starting in 1923, there was a big
= eapot piece of land in Wyoming called Teapot Dome. It got its
— name because there was a rock formation that looked
like a teapot. This land was special because it had a lot
of oil underground, which was very valuable.

The government decided to keep this oil for
emergencies, like for the Navy. But a man named
Albert Fall, who was in charge of the land, did
something sneaky. He secretly gave permission to
some rich oilmen to take the oil from Teapot Dome
and other places in California. In return, these
oilmen gave Albert Fall a lot of money, about

$400,000, which is worth over $7 million in
2024's dollars.

People started to get suspicious about what was happening. A senator named
Thomas J. Walsh began to investigate. He found out about the secret deals and the bribes.
When the truth came out, everyone was shocked and angry. They realized that Albert Fall
had broken the law by taking bribes and letting the oilmen take the oil without any
competition.

Albert Fall was found guilty and became the first U.S. government official to go to jail for
crimes committed while in of fice. This scandal showed everyone how important it is to have

honest leaders and to keep an eye on what the government is doing. Even though President
Harding didn't have anything to do with the scandal, his reputation was hurt by it.

The Teapot Dome Scandal taught people that corruption can happen even at the highest
levels of government. It also showed the importance of investigations to keep things fair and
honest. It was the biggest U.S. government political scandal until Watergate in the 1970s.

The End.
