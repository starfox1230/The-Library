other
projects. Less investment isn't good for anyone (even the government), because businesses
might not grow as fast, and that affects jobs and the whole community.

When there is an income tax, the government doesn't have much reason to spend its funds
carefully since it has a steady and nearly endless supply of money. It often uses taxes to
create all sorts of social programs and projects which makes it grow larger and more
powerful. It can also become very wasteful, spending money in ways many people dont approve
of. Here are some examples of government waste:

¢ In June of 2017, the U.S. government spent $28 million to buy camouflage uniforms for the
Afghan army. The problem? Afghanistan's countryside is mostly desert or mountains, and
the new uniforms featured bright green colors that didn't blend in.

¢ The U.S. government paid $20 million to a nonprofit group to make a Sesame Street show in
Iraq.

¢ The U.S. government paid $2 milion for pottery classes and promotion in Morocco.

¢ The government pays (as of 2024) around $1.7 billion a year to maintain buildings it no
longer uses. Money is used to mow the lawns, keep the pipes from freezing, and for
electricity.

Keeping taxes low is the best way to prevent the government from growing too big, wasting
money, and getting involved in everyone's business. Taxing income is just a legalized form of
stealing.

As arguments over income tax raged on, people across the country spoke out. Some supported
the 16th Amendment, saying it was necessary, while others strongly disagreed and wanted it
gone. Newspapers were filled with passionate editorials, and public rallies drew crowds eager
to hear the arguments.

Imagine you re reading a newspapen and you come across an article that feels different from
the others. It's not just telling you facts or reporting what happened; instead, it's giving you
someone s opinion on a big issue, like climate change, school policies, or a recent event. This type
of article is called an editorial.

An editorial is written by the editors or the people in charge of the newspaper or magazine.
They write it to share what the newspaper or magazine thinks about an issue. It's like the
publication saying, Here's what we believe is right, and here's why.’ They often try to convince
readers to see things from their perspective.

Unlike regular news stories that stick to the facts and try to be neutral, editorials are all about
sharing a viewpoint and trying to convince you to think the same way.

In Congress, heated discussions took place as lawmakers weighed the potential impact of the
amendment on the country's economy and its citizens.

Finally, after a lot of arguing, the ]}6th Amendment was passed by Congress and sent to the
states for ratification. On February 3, 1913, after more than enough states had approved
it, the 16th Amendment was officially adopted into the Constitution.

When it comes to a change made to the U.S. Constitution, three-fourths of the states (38
out of 50) need to agree on the new rule before it can become a law. This process of agreeing
and officially approving a new law added to the Constitution (an amendment) is called
ratification.

The 16th amendment says:

The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source
derived, without apportionnent among the several States, and without regard to any census or
enumeration.

Llama McRama translation service:

Congress can collect income taxes from any source, no
matter where the money comes from. They can do this
without dividing it up among the states and without
considering the population count.

So, that's how things have been since 1913. The U.S. government takes some of the money
that all citizens earn. In the process, the government became much more powerful and
centralized.

Being more centralized means that more power and control are now concentrated at the
national, or federal, level instead of being spread out among individual states. Originally, as

we ve discussed, the U.S. government was designed to be more dependent on the states and
collected funds mainly through tariffs. Once the federal government began collecting income
taxes directly from individuals and states, it gained more control, giving it more power over the
country's money. This shift allowed the federal government to make decisions and fund projects
across the whole country more
easily. That means it can
