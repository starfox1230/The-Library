\ fe Dignitaries gathering in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles, France, for the Ba
signing of the Treaty of Versailles

With the memory of the Great War and the sacrifices made etched in the hearts and minds
of the American people, President Wilson headed to the glittering palace of Versailles
(pronounced ver-sigh) for a treaty that would impact the decades to come.

The treaty, signed in 1919, was supposed to mark the end of World War 1 and create lasting
peace. Imagine the grand halls of the Palace of Versailles in France, where leaders from the
Allied countries— Britain, France, the United States, and Italy-gathered to decide
Germany's fate. The leaders hoped that by punishing Germany they'd prevent another wan
but the terms they laid down would have consequences that no one could have imagined.

Let's pretend we are listening to the countries talk as the treaty is ready to be signed:

Britain: Alright, Germany, let's get one thing straight—you started this mess, and now you
have to pay for it.”

Germany: “Wait, hold on! It wasn't just us! There were so many factors, and all the
alliances—*

France: (interrupts) “Enough excuses. You invaded our land, destroyed our towns, and
caused unimaginable loss. We need reparations, and you're going to pay them.’

Germany: (looking around nervously) “Reparations? But... how much are we talking about
here?”

United States: (trying to stay calm) “It's alot, but these reparations will cover the damage
caused and the lives affected. Think of it as your responsibility for starting the wan’

Germany: (stunned) “But I don't have that kind of money! My people are struggling already,
and if you make me pay all of this, my economy will collapse. °

France: “That's not our problem. Oh, and by the way, you'll also be giving up land and
shrinking your military, so you dont even think about starting trouble again.”

Germany: (angry and frustrated) “So I'm left defenseless, poon and humiliated? How do you
expect me to rebuild? Youre taking away everything- our land, our resources, our dignity!"

Britain: (with a stern look) "You brought this on yourself’ We can't just let you walk away
after all the damage you caused. °

United States: (turns quietly to Britain and France) “Maybe we're being a bit too harsh. This
punishment could backfire one day if Germany gets too desperate. °

France: (firmly) “We need security. Germany needs to know we're serious about peace, and
this is the only way.”

Germany: (grifting its teeth) “This is going to hurt us all. You're planting seeds of angen and
my people won't forget this. One day, they'll want to restore our pride.”

United States: (sighs, looking worried) “Just sign the treaty, and let's get on with our lives.

Germany: (signs reluctantly) “Fine! But know this, we ll never forget how you treated us
here.”

Germany was shocked, angry, and felt betrayed. The treaty blamed Germany entirely for
the war with a paragraph known as the ‘War Guilt" clause, and demanded huge payments,
called reparations, for the damage caused.

These reparations were overwhelming, costing Germany the equivalent of $500 billion in
2024 US dollars and putting a massive strain on its economy.

Greek and Latin roots: Reparation comes from the Latin word reparare meaning to repair
or restore. Someone who is paying reparations is having to repair the damage they caused,
restoring things back to normal.

To pay towards the amount owed, Germany was
allowed to pay in cash or in goods. Some of the goods it
could use to pay its debt were coal, timben chemicals,
livestock, construction materials, and factory
machinery.

Factories struggled, people lost jobs, and money lost
its value so quickly that families needed a wheelbarrow
full of cash just to buy bread. With many people out
of work and prices soaring, life in Germany became
hard and frustrating for ordinary people.

But that wasn't all. Germany also lost land, including

areas rich in resources that it relied on for its

economy. Its military was nearly dismantled, stripped down to a small force, and it was
banned from building up its navy and air force. To many Germans, this was a national
humiliation. The people felt they had been treated unfairly and that they were suffering for
decisions made by leaders they hadn't even chosen. A wave of bitterness swept over the
country as many Germans longed to restore their pride and powen

This hardship eventually paved the way for Adolf Hitlen who promised to bring Germany back
to greatness and overturn the treaty's humiliating terms. Many Germans saw him as the
leader who would help them recover from years of punishment. With anger still simmering
from the treaty, the seeds of World War 2 were sown. Instead of lasting peace, the
Treaty of Versailles planted the roots for an even bigger and deadlier conflict to come.

While Germany struggled under the weight of its post-war troubles, America thrived,
stepping eagerly into a new decade filled with excitement and promise.
