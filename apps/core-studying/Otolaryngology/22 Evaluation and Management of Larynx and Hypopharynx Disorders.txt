                Larynx and Hypopharynx
                Disorders

EPIGLOTTITIS

                   Epiglottitis (supraglottitis) is inflammation of the epiglottis and adjacent supraglottic
                   structures. Acute supraglottitis is a serious condition and can be potentially fatal. The
                   area around the epiglottis is rich in lymphatic tissue and this makes it easy for inflam-
                   mation and infection to spread to the epiglottis. Airway management takes priority
                   in these patients. Often, patients are seen in the emergency department and quickly
                   intubated. The condition is usually short lived and with appropriate management the
                   epiglottis returns to normal size after 48 to 72 hours.

                          Making the diagnosis between epiglottitis and viral laryngotracheobronchitis
                   (croup) is often confusing and difficult because they both share the same signs and
                   symptoms. Epiglottitis occurs much less commonly than croup in children. Usually
                   with croup there is coughing and an absence of drooling and with epiglottitis there is
                   drooling with an absence of coughing.

                    Most common: Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). NOTE: There has been a decline

                        in epiglottitis since the introduction of the Hib vaccine in childhood immunization pro-

                    Laryngeal sarcoidosis (rare)
                    Trauma

Symptoms and Presentation

                   The following may or may not be present:

                    Cough
                    Drooling
                    Rapidly developing sore throat
                    High fever
                    Restlessness
                    Lethargy
                    Inspiratory stridor

Tests

        The diagnosis of epiglottitis is essentially clinical but can be supported by plain x-ray
          or flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy (FFL).

        Acute epiglottitis can usually be seen easily with plain x-ray, which usually shows
          thickening of the epiglottis--"thumb print sign"--and the aryepiglottic folds. NOTE:
          If a patient suspected of having epiglottitis presents to the emergency department,

          bring the x-ray machine to the patient while at the same time closely monitoring the

          patient for airway compromise. There have been cases where the patient went to the

          radiology department for an x-ray, without being closely monitored; symptoms worsen

          quickly and obstruction of the airway occurred.
        FFL can be done, however; careful attention needs to be made not to further injure

          the larynx as this can provoke airway spasms and cause an immediate worsening in
          symptoms. On FFL, findings for epiglottitis usually include the following:
           Normal or mild inflammation of vocal cords (VCs)
           Normal or mild inflammation of upper trachea
           Edema of the epiglottis
           Edema of the aryepiglottic folds

Treatment

                    In cases of airway compromise, intravenous antibiotic therapy is often given. NOTE:
                        Usually second-generation cephalosporin (Ceclor, Cefzil, Ceftin, etc.) or third-generation
                        cephalosporin (Omnicef, Rocephin, etc.), either alone or in combination with penicillin
                        or ampicillin for streptococcal coverage, is given. If the patient is allergic to penicillin,
                        clindamycin can be used.

ACUTE AND CHRONIC LARYNGITIS

Laryngitis is a general term that refers to any infectious, noninfectious, localized, or
systemic inflammatory process that involves the larynx. Laryngitis in children is most
often caused by viral croup. Laryngitis in adults is most often caused by viral upper
respiratory infection, smoking, or laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR).

LARYNGOPHARYNGEAL REFLUX

                   LPR is the retrograde movement of gastric contents into the laryngopharynx, lead-
                   ing to symptoms referable to the larynx/hypopharynx. Many issues with respect
                   to the diagnosis and treatment of LPR are considered controversial, including the
                   clinical diagnostic criteria and the studies necessary to establish a diagnosis. There
                   are differing opinions between otolaryngologists and gastroenterologists regarding

                   some patients are mistakenly diagnosed with LPR; therefore, it is important to rule
                   out other causes of laryngeal symptoms (smoking, allergies, sinus and pulmonary
                   disease, etc.) in patients who fail to respond to LPR treatment measures.

Symptoms

                   The following may or may not be present:

                    LPR may be associated with an acute, chronic, or intermittent pattern of laryngitis.
                    Dysphonia/hoarseness
                    Globus sensation
                    Mild dysphagia
                    Chronic cough
                    Nonproductive throat clearing
                    Excessive throat mucus/postnasal drip
                    Heartburn: Only 35% of patients report this symptom (Franco, 2006)

Associated Conditions

                    VC granulomas
                    Recurrent laryngospasms
                    LPR plays a role in the formation of subglottic stenosis

                      Chapter 21: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease section.
                       Within 2 to 3 months of treatment, most patients report significant symptomatic
                         improvement; however, it may take 6 months or longer for the laryngeal findings
                         of LPR to resolve. Usually, symptoms improve before objective laryngeal findings
                         occur (DelGaudio & Waring, 2003).

landmarks.
                      The vocal apparatus consists of two pairs of mucosal folds--the false VCs and
               true VCs. The false VCs are thicker, do not vibrate, and are not responsible for speech
               production, although they do help produce deep tones such as screaming or growl-
               ing. The true VCs are used primarily in voice production and produce sounds associ-
               ated with speech. Muscles attached to connective tissue--the thyroid and arytenoid
               cartilages--help the VCs with movement. The recurrent laryngeal nerve innervates all
               laryngeal muscles responsible for adducting and abducting the vocal folds. By adduct-
               ing (bringing together) the arytenoid cartilages, the vocal folds can vibrate. By abduct-
               ing (spreading apart) the arytenoid cartilages, the vocal folds can separate.

                       NOTE: When the adductor and abductor muscles are affected in SD, it does not nor-

               mally interfere with the patient's ability to breathe, swallow, or cough and it does not affect

               the voice during singing or whispering. It does not hurt to talk and sometimes the voice is

               worse when speaking loudly or in times of stress.

                          The diagnosis of SD is based on patient history, voice characteristics, and fiberop-
                   tic laryngeal examination while the patient repeats words and/or phrases.

Spasmodic Dysphonia Management

                   There is no cure for SD. Treatment is designed to help the symptoms of the disorder. Suc-
                   cessful management of SD involves workup and evaluation from the otolaryngologist,
                   neurologist, and speech pathologist. The neurologist will exclude any associated neu-
                   rological diseases process. Research is needed to identify the central neuropathophysi-
                   ology responsible for the laryngeal muscle spasms in order to target treatment toward
                   the central neurological abnormality responsible for producing symptoms.

Spasmodic Dysphonia Management Options

                  Voice Therapy
                    Voice therapy alone may be effective for patients with mild forms of SD and may

                      prolong the duration of effectiveness for those treated with botulinum toxin injec-
                      tion (Botox) therapy.
                    Voice therapy typically lasts for six to eight sessions over 8 to 10 weeks.

                  Botulinum Toxin Injection (Botox)
                    Treatment of choice, usually in combination with voice therapy
                    Botox weakens the affected laryngeal muscles
                    Botox is injected externally on the outside of the neck into the affected laryngeal

                      muscle(s).
                       For adductor SD: Interarytenoid Botox injection treatment
                       For abductor SD: Cricothyroid Botox injection treatment
                         NOTE: The amount of Botox is different for each patient and there is no set stan-

                            dard.
                    Vocal improvement is seen in up to 90% of patients (Bailey & Johnson, 2001b).
                    Typically the toxin's effects may be noticed within the first 48 to 72 hours.
                    For a few days, up to a few weeks:

                       Adductor SD patients may experience a hoarse or breathy quality to their voice
                         and/or difficulty swallowing liquids.

                       Abductor SD patients may experience stridor, airway compromise, and/or
                         dysphagia. For these reasons, unilateral injections are usually done instead of
                         bilateral injections.

                       Symptoms for both adductor and abductor SD usually resolve within days to a
                         few weeks.

                    Most patients enjoy up to a 2- to 3-month period of improved speech.
                    Injections are generally required every 2 to 4 months.

                    Botox Considerations
                    It can reduce the speed of vocal fold closure predisposing the patient to aspiration.
                    Is not indicated in patients with preexisting neurological disorders such as myasthe-

                      nia gravis because it may make the symptoms worse.
                    Complications and side effects are usually related to improper dosing or improper

                      placement of the injected toxin.

                  Surgery Options
                    All surgical options generally provide transient and variable results because they do

                      not correct the underlying disease process in the brain, a process which is still not
                      well understood.

                    Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Deinnervation and Reinnervation
                    Involves section of the adductor branches of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and rein-

                      nervation with the ansa cervicalis nerve. The operation is irreversible and may leave

                    Partial Thyroarytenoid and Cricoarytenoid Myomectomy
                    Removal of the VC muscle, which weakens the vocal folds bilaterally and prevents

                      spasms
                    It is performed under local anesthesia and the procedure is titrated to the degree of

                      breathiness to eliminate the risk of overresection.

                    Thyroplasty (Vocal Implant)
                    The idea is to change the thyroid cartilage shape to relax and slightly medialize the

                      vocal folds.

                      can result in damage to the left RLN because it extends into the chest and loops
                      under the arch of the aorta.

                Tumors
                 Neoplastic or nonneoplastic tumors can invade either the vagus nerve branches

                   that innervate the larynx or RLN. This can occur with cancer to the mediastinum,
                   larynx, lung, thyroid and, esophagus, and skull base tumors.

                 Infectious (viral infection [e.g., herpes simplex], or Lyme disease, syphilis)
                 Idiopathic VC paralysis is possible once all other etiologies are ruled out.

                       When unilateral vocal cord paralysis (UVCP) occurs, symptoms are related to
                the glottic gap, or space between the weakened or paralyzed cord and functioning
                cord. With bilateral vocal cord paralysis (BVCP), the vocal folds typically drift to the
                midline soon after injury and this causes a narrow (usually 1-3 mm) slit-like glottic
                opening, which can cause stridor and airway compromise. Voice quality with BVCP
                can be good in most cases because the VCs are in close proximity to one another.
                Patients with BVCP may say short, hurried, quick, stridorous phrases with interrup-
                tions to take a deep breath.

                 Shortness of breath during speech (related to inefficient laryngeal closure, not pul-

                   monary in origin)
                 Airway obstruction
                 Stridor (most common with bilateral paralysis)
                 Weak cough or unsuccessful cough
                 Patients may complain of pain in the throat or neck after voice use, which can be

                   related to excessive muscle tension (compensation) related to one VC not function-
                   ing properly.
                 Persistent hoarseness
                 Mild to severe reduction in vocal volume
                 The ability to perform a Valsalva maneuver may be impaired because of insufficient
                   laryngeal closure in unilateral paralysis.

                       Doing a FFL or video stroboscopy (VS) and observing the VCs during motion is
                the method to diagnose vocal paresis/paralysis. With UVCP, the vocal fold will either
                be immobile or demonstrate decreased abduction or adduction. With BVCP, the vocal
                folds tend to drift toward the midline. With UVCP, some patients can compensate by
                adducting the functioning vocal fold to the nonfunctioning fold, closing the glottic
                gap, and produce somewhat normal quality voice sounds. With BVCP paralysis, air-
                way compromise is the biggest concern.

                        NOTE: When evaluating the patient with FFL or VS, ask the patient to perform an "ee-

                sniff" maneuver. This causes the vocal folds to maximally alternate from the adduct position

                to the abduct position. Also, remember that the interarytenoid muscle (the midline muscle)

                gets innervation from the RLN on both the right and left sides. So if there is UVCP, the affected

                fold may look like it is partially moving because of innervation from the contralateral RLN. It

                may look like there is a little movement of the affected vocal fold, but this is misleading.

Workup

                 Goal: To rule out pathology affecting the RLN
                 There is no consensus on whether CT or MRI is better for evaluating the RLN. How-

                   ever, the consensus is a CT scan is the study of choice.
                 Imaging needs to evaluate the full length of the RLN; therefore, it is necessary to

                   image from the skull base to the thoracic inlet/arch of the aorta. A CT of the neck and
                   chest is usually ordered. NOTE: Keep in mind that the left RLN loops around the arch of
                   the aorta and the right RLN loops around the subclavian artery.
424  22. LARYNX AND HYPOPHARYNX DISORDERS

                    If a lesion is suspected at the skull base and brain, MRI of the brain and brainstem
                      with gadolinium enhancement best evaluates this area.

Management

                   In situations where vocal fold paresis/paralysis may be due to inflammation, recovery
                   of normal motion of the VCs may return spontaneously. (NOTE: Inflammatory processes
                     that can affect the larynx include sarcoidosis, syphilis, Wegener's granulomatosis, amy-
                   loidosis, relapsing polychondritis, etc.). After workup is complete and the diagnosis of
                   RLN abnormalities are ruled out and there is no airway compromise, it is reasonable
                   to consider observation for 6 to 12 months with a trial of speech therapy and to reserve
                   surgical treatment for patients with continued dysphonia despite conservative ther-
                   apy. If the paralysis is properly managed, the normal speaking voice can typically be
                   restored.

                  Speech Therapy
                    Purpose of speech therapy: Voice and/or swallowing strengthening
                    Can be used as an initial treatment option or in conjunction with surgical medical-

                      ization of the paralyzed VC in UVCP
                    Results can usually be seen within two to three sessions of speech therapy
                    Speech therapy focuses on proper voice use and how to properly care for the VCs

                      (voice hygiene), which includes hydration and eliminating behaviors considered
                      harmful to the vocal process (i.e., yelling, etc.).

Surgical Management: Unilateral Vocal Cord Paralysis

                   Not every patient with UVCP needs intervention. Recovery of the paralyzed
                   VC or compensation by the nonparalyzed VC is possible without surgical
                   intervention.

                  Indications for Surgery
                    Patients at risk for aspiration or airway compromise
                    Persistent dysphonia despite speech therapy
                    Ineffective cough (at risk for aspiration)
                    Known complete transection nerve injury (usually seen in trauma)

                     NOTE: A poorly abducting nonparalyzed VC is a relative contraindication for surgical treat-
                     ment. This is because the airway is already partially obstructed when surgical medializa-
                     tion of the paralyzed VC is done.

                  Contraindications for Surgery
                    Malignant disease overlying the laryngotracheal region
                    Poor abduction of the contralateral vocal fold
                    Previous history of radiation therapy to the larynx (relative contraindication)

                  Medialization Laryngoplasty
                    Positions the weak vocal fold midline. This allows for a stronger "strike" against the

                      opposite VC, providing for a stronger and louder voice. This can be achieved by:
                       Injecting a filler substance into the vocal fold (most common)

                      · Temporary: There are temporary implants often used while allowing time to
                            see if the RLN will partially or fully recover.
                                                                                        VOCAL CORD PARALYSIS  425

                      · Permanent: If nerve recovery and/or adequate compensation by the nonpara-
                            lyzed VC does not occur, a vocal fold implant (permanent) can be inserted. This
                            procedure is irreversible.

                       Type I thyroplasty: The VCs are brought closer together by inserting an implant
                         next to the impaired VC to push the VC toward the midline. This procedure is
                         reversible.

                       Arytenoid adduction: Allows for more effective means for medialization and
                         is usually done in addition to Type I thyroplasty. The operation involves place-
                         ment of a suture from the muscular process of the arytenoid to an anterior
                         location on the thyroid cartilage. It helps to medialize and stabilize the vocal
                         process.

                  Postop
                    After surgery, patients are placed on voice rest for typically 5 to 7 days.
                    Speech therapy is initiated.

                  Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Deinnervation and Reinnervation
                    Involves section of the adductor branches of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and rein-

                      nervation with the ansa cervicalis nerve. The operation is irreversible and may leave
                      patients with either dyspnea or a breathy voice.

Surgical Management: Bilateral Vocal Cord Paralysis

                   Surgical treatment for BVCP is not aimed at improving voice quality, but rather the
                   main concern for these patients is airway compromise. The voice quality is usually
                   only mildly affected if just the RLN is involved.

                  Indications for Surgery
                    Only patients with severe bilateral vocal cord immobility require surgical intervention.
                    If the cause is not related to surgery, but rather a neurological condition (parkin-

                      sonism, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS], etc.), treatment of the underly-
                      ing condition often improves patient symptoms.

                  Surgical Options
                    Tracheotomy
                    Considered if a patient's airway is impaired. This also allows for time to pass and see

                      if spontaneous recovery occurs within 6 to 12 months.

                    Vocal Cord Lateralization
                    Involves techniques to surgically widen the glottic opening. This improves the air-

                      way; however, it also sacrifices the patient's voice quality. There are three methods
                      of widening the glottic opening:
                       Cordectomy/cordotomy: Involves excising a C-shaped wedge from the posterior

                         edge of one VC. It is the most common procedure performed. Voice quality in
                         these patients does worsen and becomes more breathy but patients can generally
                         maintain good control with their voice without airway compromise.
                       Arytenoidectomy: Involves removal of some or all of the arytenoid cartilage
                       Arytenoidopexy: Displaces the vocal fold and arytenoid without surgical removal
                         of any tissue. However, there is a relatively high failure rate with this procedure.

              Other benign vocal fold lesions can include the following.

Vocal Cord Granuloma

Figure 22.7:   Also known as "contact granuloma" or "contact ulcer"
Vocal cord     These ulcerative lesions affect the posterior aspect of the VC in the arytenoid region.
granuloma.
                 Because of the location of these lesions, it may or may not have much of an effect on
                 the voice.

                                           granuloma.

               Can result from voice abuse, trauma from intubation, or excessive coughing and
                 reflux (GERD or LPR). NOTE: These lesions require a biopsy because squamous cell
                 carcinoma (SCC) can present with similar features.

Vocal Cord Papilloma

Figure 22.8:   Small grape- or wart-like lesions on the VC that can vary in size and shape
Vocal cord     There are many viruses that cause papillomas. Most commonly, the human papil-
papilloma.
                 loma virus (HPV) causes them. The most common viral subtypes involved are HPV-
                 6, HPV-7, and HPV-11. Laryngeal (respiratory) papillomatosis is not considered a
                 sexually transmitted disease.
               Children can present with VC papillomas. The etiology in these cases involves trans-
                 mission of the virus by vaginal delivery in the mother with genital HPV and with
                 active disease in the birth canal. Spontaneous resolution can occur in children, usu-
                 ally around adolescence.
               If the lesions are present in adulthood, they are usually more localized and less
                 severe. The mode of transmission in this population is less understood. They tend
                 not to occur outside the larynx in this population.
               In severe cases (mainly childhood onset), papillomas can be recurrent and affect the
                 larynx, trachea, and pulmonary tract (called recurrent respiratory laryngeal papil-
                 lomatosis) causing potential airway compromise.
               Rarely papillomas may undergo malignant degeneration to SCC (3%-5%; Bailey &
                 Johnson, 2001c).

                                                                                               FIGURE 22.8 Vocal cord
                                                                                                          papilloma.

                    There is no medical or surgical treatment that can cure recurrent respiratory laryn-
                      geal papillomatosis.

                    Because of potential airway compromise, often these lesions need to be surgically
                      debulked with a microdebrider or laser. Even when excised, recurrence rates for
                      these lesions is high, especially childhood-onset disease.

                    There is some benefit to taking acid-reducing medications. These medications can
                      decrease the recurrence rates of papillomas in the larynx. It is thought that LPR stim-
                      ulates the virus to produce papillomas.

                     NOTE: The role of the HPV Gardasil vaccine in preventing laryngeal papillomas is not yet
                     known.

Rheumatological Lesions of the Vocal Cord
                    A variety of rheumatological disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, etc.)
                      can cause an inflammatory process and deposit of abnormal tissue within the lamina
                      propria of the vocal fold.
                    There are often multiple fibrotic nodular lesions and can extend deep within the
                      VC. They can appear creamy yellow on the superior surface of the fold. NOTE: The

                        lesions are called "rheumatoid nodules" or "bamboo nodules" as these nodes look like
                        the horizontal segments on the stem of a bamboo stalk.
                    Dissection can be difficult. Postoperative vocal fold stiffness is common.
                    Collaborate with the patient's rheumatologist and work to control the underlying
                      disease process. Voice therapy and surgical therapy should be considered after the
                      patient has been maximally treated for the disease condition.

Vascular Lesions of the Vocal Cord
                    Occur due to dilatation or rupture of the blood vessels along the VC
                    They are mainly related to acute vocal trauma as with yelling, excessive coughing,
                      and crying or chronic voice abuse.
                    These patients usually benefit from voice rest.

Laryngitis Sicca
                    Laryngitis caused from dryness (sicca)
432  22. LARYNX AND HYPOPHARYNX DISORDERS

                    Dryness can occur related to medications, mouth breathing, smoking, and dehy-
                      dration. NOTE: Common medications with dryness side effect include antihistamines,
                        anticholinergics, diuretics, antianxiety, sleep aids, and benzodiazepines.

                    When the vocal process is dry, a cough can result and inflammation of the vocal folds
                      can occur.

                    Treatment includes hydration, limiting aggravating factors, use of steam/mist
                      humidifiers, and trial of Mucinex (guaifenesin), which may or may not help.

Treatment of Benign Vocal Cord Lesions

                   The most common treatment options for benign VC lesions include voice rest, voice
                   therapy, and surgery. Most patients should initially receive nonsurgical treatment for
                   these lesions to properly assess changes in the VC lesion with conservative therapy.
                   Therapy options can include:

                  Medical Therapy
                    Management of underlying

                       Allergy symptoms
                       Reflux/LPR
                       Asthma

                  Behavioral Therapy
                    Vocal Hygiene
                    Hydration (six to eight glasses of water per day)
                    Minimize exposure to chemicals, fumes, and so forth
                    Stop smoking and/or stay out of a smoke-filled environment
                    Avoid excessive shouting, screaming, and throat clearing or other loud voice use
                    Whispering can cause additional stress as well. Advise patients that if they are to use

                      their voice, they should do so in a regular soft tone.

                  Voice Rest and Other Suggestions
                    Typically 1 to 2 weeks duration
                    Exercise such as weightlifting produce forceful VC closure and can result in VC

                      injury.
                    Playing musical instruments (e.g., trumpet) can result in forceful VC contact

                  Voice Therapy
                    Goal: Maximize efficiency of voice and eliminate vocal behaviors that caused the

                      lesion(s) to begin with
                    Certified and license speech-language pathologists (SLP) work with the patient to

                      provide effective exercises and rehabilitative measures.
                    Voice therapy involves the SLP working with the patient to improve the speaking

                      techniques by targeting different aspect of voice and/or speech production.
                    The frequency of voice therapy sessions varies widely depending on the diagnosis

                      and the patient's skill level. Usually it is one to two sessions per week for 6 to 8
                      weeks. NOTE: Keep in mind that adequate improvement with the voice does not neces-
                        sarily mean the lesion(s) have entirely disappeared. Also, VC polyps and cysts are much
                        less responsive to voice therapy.

                  Surgical Therapy
                    Considered for patients when maximal behavioral intervention does not achieve

                      satisfactory improvement in the voice. Unless airway compromise is a factor, it is
                                                                         MALIGNANT VOCAL CORD LESIONS  433

                  not absolutely necessary for patients to undergo surgical therapy for these lesions,
                  especially if they do not have a vocally demanding lifestyle or significant functional
                  impairment from the lesion(s).
                Goal: Careful removal of abnormal tissue with maximal preservation of the VCs
                Postoperatively, many advocate a period of 4 to 14 days of absolute voice rest follow-
                  ing vocal fold surgery.
