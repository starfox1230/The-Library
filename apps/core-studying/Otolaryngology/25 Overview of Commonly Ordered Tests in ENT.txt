               the thyroid, parotid,     the clavicle. It includes the parotid

                                         Noncontrast is preferred instead.

                                       MRI is the preferred imaging study
                                         of choice for salivary gland masses.

                                           Most FNA of thyroid nodules are
                                             ultrasound guided.

                                           The Society of Radiologists in
                                             Ultrasound suggests an FNA should
                                             be considered for a nodule 1.0 cm
                                             or more at the largest diameter if
                                             microcalcifications are present and
                                             for a nodule 1.5 cm or larger if the
                                             nodule is solid or if there are coarse
                                             calcifications within the nodule.

                                             Endocrinologists recommends FNA
                                             even for nodules smaller than 10
                                             mm whenever clinical information or

                                           A thyroid ultrasound uses a
                                             transducer that is passed back and
                                             forth over the neck to form a picture
                                             using soundwaves.

                                           A thyroid ultrasound can check the
                                             thyroid in addition to the parathyroids.

                                           On ultrasound a nodule is an area
                                             in the thyroid that looks different
                                             from the background. It can detect

RADIATION EXPOSURE

                   We are exposed to radiation from natural sources all the time. The average person receives
                   approximately 3 mSv per year from naturally occurring radioactive materials (sun expo-
                   sure, for example). The use of diagnostic imaging where patients are exposed to ionizing
                   radiation is increasing. Ionizing radiation from medical imaging now accounts for nearly
                   half of the radiation exposure experienced by the U.S population (Brenner & Hall, 2007).
                   The majority of radiation from medical imaging arises from CT procedures. MRI and
                   ultrasound procedures do not use ionizing radiation. Generally, the exposure of ionizing
                   radiation with these examinations is very small, thus the health risk associated with low
                   levels of exposure is not fully known.

                          Ionizing radiation can cause cell and tissue damage. The effects from radiation
                   exposure do not occur during or immediately following exposure to the radiation. The
                   effects require weeks to years following exposure. Therefore, since the effects are not seen
                   immediately, the correlation to the radiation exposure cannot be easily determined. The
                   early development of life (e.g., fetus or a growing child) is a time when rapid cell division
                   is occurring. Therefore, radiation sensitivity is higher for this population. The decision
                   to order an imaging study that requires ionizing radiation involves evaluating the risk
                   versus benefit of that procedure. Radiation exposure dose limits are not the same for all
                   individuals. Different tissues have varying sensitivities to radiation exposure and the
                   actual radiation risk to different parts of the body from a given procedure varies. Yet an
                   average radiation exposure level received from a diagnostic procedure can determined.
