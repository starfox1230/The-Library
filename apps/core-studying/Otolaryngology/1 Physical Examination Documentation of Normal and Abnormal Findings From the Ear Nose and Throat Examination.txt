THE EAR

                   Proper technique of the otoscopic examination: Retract the auricle up and back while
                   inserting the speculum. This straightens the external auditory canal (EAC) and pro-
                   vides best visualization of the tympanic membrane (TM).

Conchal Bowl

                   The conchal bowl, or concha, describes the cartilage that is situated near the ear
                   canal and looks like a bowl. Just like the pinna, it helps to funnel sounds into the
                   canal.

                  Possible Abnormal Findings
                   Document the presence of any of the following abnormal findings:

External Auditory Canal

                   The EAC (also called external acoustic or auditory meatus) allows efficient sound
                   transmission to occur from the environment to the TM. The EAC also allows for ade-
                   quate protection from direct injury to the TM related to the depth of the canal and its
                   shape.

Middle Ear

                   The middle ear contains three ossicles, which transfer sound vibrations of the TM into
                   waves in the fluid and membranes within the cochlea of the inner ear. The space behind
                   the TM is called the tympanic cavity and directly off this cavity is the eustachian tube,
                   which connects to the nasopharynx. The eustachian tube is responsible for equalizing
                   pressure in the tympanic cavity.

      Purulent effusion
      Congenital malformations

         Ossicular deformity

PROCEDURE PROTOCOL: PNEUMATIC OTOSCOPY

Purpose: To evaluate the mobility of the tympanic membrane (TM).

Proper technique: Using a bulb pneumatic attachment to the otoscope, the specu-
lum of the otoscope must form a tight seal in the ear canal. Gently "puff" the bulb,
which causes both negative and positive pressure to the TM.

Positive Pressure                       Negative Pressure

 Causes the TM to retract inward.        Causes the TM to bulge outward.
 If the middle ear is under positive     If the middle ear is under negative

   pressure (e.g., from ear infection)     pressure, the TM will not move
   the TM will move when positive          when positive pressure is applied;
   pressure is applied but not when        when negative pressure is applied,
   negative pressure is applied.           the TM will bulge outward.
6  1. DOCUMENTATION OF NORMAL AND ABNORMAL FINDINGS IN THE ENT EXAM

Tympanic Membrane

                   The TM separates the external ear canal from the middle ear. Its function is to transmit
                   sound from the air to the ossicles inside the middle ear. The two areas of the TM are the
                   pars flaccida and pars tensa. The pars flaccida is most commonly where cholesteatomas
                   can be found. The pars tensa forms most of the TM and this is the area in which perfora-
                   tions most commonly occur. The pars tensa consists of three layers: skin, fibrous tissue,
                   and mucosa.

             PROCEDURE PROTOCOL: RINNE AND WEBER TUNING FORK TESTS

             Introduction

             The tuning fork tests the cochleovestibular nerve (CN VIII). The Rinne and Weber
             tuning fork tests help to distinguish between conductive hearing loss (CHL) and
             sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) by measuring air and bone conduction. Both
             tests use the 512 Hz fork.

                    Air conduction (AC) is measured by hearing sound via the ear canal and
             middle ear. By evaluating AC, you are evaluating whether or not CHL exists.

                    Bone conduction (BC) is measured by hearing sound transmission to the
             inner ear via the mastoid process. By evaluating BC, you are evaluating whether
             or not SNHL exists. NOTE: Do the Weber test first then confirm your findings with
             the Rinne test.

          If the sound is louder in one ear:          Document: AC > BC.
              This could mean CHL in that ear or
              SNHL in the opposite ear.               CHL is confirmed if:

                Proper technique when examining the nose: Using a headlight, inspect the nose for
                evidence of previous trauma such as scars or deformities. Examine the skin for lesions.
                Look at the nares and columella for symmetry. Insert a nasal speculum into the nasal
                cavity. Lift the ala and gently open the speculum vertically. NOTE: Try to avoid touching
                the patient's nasal septum with the speculum as this may cause some pain or discomfort.

                Also, remove the speculum from the nose while it is in an open position; if it is closed

                when you remove it, you may pull out nasal hair.
                       Examine the septum for deviation, spur projection, or perforation. Inspect the infe-

                rior and middle turbinates mucosa for color, discharge, swelling, or lesions. Note any pol-
                yps present within the vestibule or adjacent to the middle turbinate (middle meatus).

Normal Nose Examination

External nose.
                 No discharge. Septum is midline. Inferior and middle turbinates are normal. NOTE:
                   80% or more of patients will have a deviated septum. This does not necessarily indicate
                   an abnormal finding.

Video 1.1:  PROCEDURE PROTOCOL: NASAL ENDOSCOPY
Nasal
endoscopy.  Introduction

            Nasal endoscopy involves evaluating the nasal and sinus passages (if previous
            history of sinus surgery) with direction visualization using a flexible fiberoptic
            endoscope or a rigid endoscope.

            Indications

             Mucopurulent drainage
             Nasal congestion
             Hyposmia
             Anosmia
             Sinusitis
             To obtain culture of nasal secretions
             Septal deformity
             Nasal obstruction or foreign body
             To evaluate for nasal masses or polyps
             To evaluate the nasopharynx
             Eustachian tube dysfunction
             Facial pain or pressure
             Epistaxis
             Epiphora
             Postoperative evaluation and debridement and removal of crusting after func-

               tional endoscopic sinus surgery

            Contraindications

            No absolute contraindications exist. However, the examination should be per-
            formed carefully so as to not provoke bleeding, especially in patients on antico-
            agulants or with a bleeding disorder.

            Equipment Needed

             Endoscope
             Spray containing topical anesthetic and vasoconstrictor; for example, Afrin

               and lidocaine

            Procedure Protocol

             Seat the patient comfortably in an examination chair. Instruct the patient to
               move the hips to the back of the chair, straighten the back, lean forward, and
               tilt the chin up as if "sniffing flowers."

             Position yourself in front or to the side of the patient.

                                                                                                                                 (continued)
12  1. DOCUMENTATION OF NORMAL AND ABNORMAL FINDINGS IN THE ENT EXAM

                      PROCEDURE PROTOCOL: NASAL ENDOSCOPY (continued)

                        Using the mixture that contains a topical anesthetic and vasoconstrictor, direct
                          the spray posteriorly--parallel to the floor of the nose and not toward the
                          ceiling. Wait several minutes after spraying to permit decongestant and anes-
                          thetic to take effect. NOTE: Tell the patient that the solution may taste bitter and
                             may produce a numbing sensation in the nose, mouth, and throat. The patient
                             may feel like he or she cannot swallow or talk, but remind the patient that these
                             functions are not affected with this medication.

                        Introduce the scope gently into one nostril (usually the nostril that appears
                          more open than the other) and pass it along the floor of the nose. Try to avoid
                          the nasal septum. If you are unable to advance along the floor of the nose
                          because of a septal deviation or large inferior turbinate, try advancing the
                          scope above the inferior turbinate or attempt entrance into the nasal cavity on
                          the opposite side of the nose.

                        During the examination, evaluate the nasal septum, inferior turbinate, inferior
                          meatus, nasopharynx, and eustachian tubes.

                        Advance the scope along the middle meatus to examine the middle turbinate.
                          If possible, gently roll medial to the middle turbinate to examine the spheno-
                          ethmoidal recess.

                        If the patient previously had sinus surgery, evaluate the sinus cavities.
                        At the conclusion of the procedure, gently wash the endoscope with run-

                          ning water and place it in an enzymatic cleanser. Then rinse the scope of any
                          cleanser and hang it up to dry before use on the next patient.

                      Potential Complications

                       Pain, bleeding, fainting (vasovagal response), and adverse drug reaction.

                      PROCEDURE PROTOCOL: EVALUATING THE NASOPHARYNX WITH
                      INDIRECT MIRROR EXAMINATION

                      Introduction

                       Indirect mirror examination allows for more complete inspection of the nasophar-
                       ynx without using a fiberoptic or rigid endoscopy. Various anatomical structures
                       can be viewed with indirect mirror examination including the posterior soft pal-
                       ate, posterior palatine tonsils, eustachian tube orifices, torus tubarius, fossa of
                       Rosenmuller, and adenoids.

                      Indications

                        A patient who cannot tolerate the flexible or rigid nasal endoscopy examination
                        A patient who is allergic to topical anesthetics or decongestants used for the

                          flexible or rigid nasal endoscopy examination
                        To evaluate for nasopharyngeal abnormalities including adenoid hypertro-

                          phy

                                                                                                                                                (continued)

                      Contraindications

                       No absolute contraindications exist.

                      Equipment Needed

                        Tongue blade
                        Indirect nasopharyngeal/laryngeal mirror
                        Headlamp
                        4 × 4 gauze

                      Procedure Protocol

                        Seat the patient comfortably in an examination chair.
                        Instruct the patient to move the hips to the back of the chair, straighten the

                          back, and lean forward with mouth open and tongue extended.
                        Position yourself in front or to the side of the patient. Have your headlight on

                          throughout this procedure.
                        If gagging is expected with the patient, a topical anesthetic can be applied

                          (e.g., Hurricaine spray).
                        Using one hand, depress the tongue with a tongue blade. Or you can hold

                          the patient's tongue or ask the patient to hold the tongue with a 4 × 4 gauze.
                          Ask the patient to relax and breathe through the nose and mouth. This
                          relaxes the soft palate. With your other hand, insert a small mirror into the
                          mouth, along the surface of the tongue blade. Come to rest between the soft
                          palate and the pharyngeal wall. Try to avoid touching the tongue, phar-
                          ynx, or palate with the mirror as this may stimulate a gag reflex. Rotate
                          the mirror from side to side to view the posterior soft palate, tonsils, and
                          nasopharynx.

Mueller Maneuver (Flexible Fiberoptic Laryngoscopy Examination Only)

                   Introduction: The Mueller maneuver is a technique on examination to evaluate for
                   velopharyngeal and/or hypopharyngeal narrowing in a patient with suspected obstruc-
                   tive sleep apnea. This is when the soft palate and the lateral or posterior pharyngeal
                   walls fail to separate the oral cavity from the nasal cavity during the Mueller maneuver.

                   Proper technique: Place the flexible fiberoptic scope in the hypopharynx where you
                   can see the entire hypopharynx and larynx. Pinch the patient's nostrils closed and ask
                   the patient to close the lips and attempt to inhale. The test is positive if the hypophar-
                   ynx collapses during the maneuver. Estimate percentage of collapse and document.

               Procedure Protocol

                Seat the patient comfortably in an examination chair. Instruct the patient to
                  move the hips to the back of the chair, straighten the back, lean forward, and
                  tilt the chin up as if "sniffing flowers."

                Decongest with a spray mixture that contains a topical anesthetic and vaso-
                  constrictor (i.e., Afrin and lidocaine). Direct the spray posteriorly--parallel
                  to the floor of the nose and not toward the ceiling. Wait several minutes after
                  spraying to permit decongestant and anesthetic to take effect. NOTE: Tell your
                  patient that the solution may taste bitter and may produce a numbing sensation
                  in the nose, mouth, and throat. The patient may feel like he or she cannot swal-
                  low or talk, but ensure the patient that these functions are not affected with this
                  medication.

                Position yourself in front or to the side of the patient. Introduce the scope gen-
                  tly into one nostril (usually the nostril that appears more open than the other)
                  and pass it along the floor of the nose. Try to avoid the nasal septum.

                                                                                                                                    (continued)
EXAM FINDINGS OF THE NOSE WITH ENDOSCOPIC OR MIRROR NASOPHARYNGEAL EXAMINATION  23

                If you are unable to advance along the floor of the nose because of a septal
                  deviation or large inferior turbinate, try advancing the scope above the infe-
                  rior turbinate or attempt entrance into the nasal cavity on the opposite side of
                  the nose.

                Once the scope is in the back of the nose, turn the scope downward to
                  examine the oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx. Observe the epiglot-
                  tis and assess the tongue base. Ask the patient to extend the tongue to
                  expose the vallecula. Assess both sides of the epiglottis. Ask the patient to
                  blow the nose against closed nostrils or have the patient "blow the cheeks
                  out" in order to inflate the pyriform sinuses. Closely examine the true and
                  false vocal cords and assess for mobility, color, swelling, nodules, or other
                  mucosal lesions (see below for common abnormal findings on flexible
                  fiberoptic laryngoscopy examination). NOTE: If you are using equipment with
                    a screen or monitor, keep in mind that the right vocal cord will be on the left
                    side of the screen and the left vocal cord will be on the right side of the screen.
                    It is similar to looking at CT scans. The patient is anatomically facing you on
                    the monitor.

                Instruct the patient to say "eee" to allow visualization of vocal cord mobility.
                  Note any incomplete abduction or adduction of the vocal cords. NOTE: If you
                    have a hard time getting the vocal cords to completely abduct, ask the patient to
                    "sniff" like sniffing a flower.

                Evaluate the subglottic trachea through the vocal cords for narrowing or
                  "subglottic stenosis." After complete visualization of the larynx, with-
                  draw the scope from the larynx and inspect the remainder of the hypo-
                  pharynx.

              Cleaning of the Equipment

               At the conclusion of the procedure, gently wash the endoscope with running
               water and place it in an enzymatic cleanser. Then rinse the scope to remove any
               cleanser and hang up to dry before use on the next patient.

              Potential Complications

               Pain, bleeding, fainting, adverse drug reaction, laryngospasm, airway loss.

              PROCEDURE PROTOCOL: EVALUATING THE LARYNX
              WITH INDIRECT MIRROR EXAMINATION

              Overview

               Indirect mirror examination allows for more complete inspection of the larynx
               without doing a flexible fiberoptic endoscopy. Various anatomical structures can
               be viewed with indirect mirror examination including the base of the tongue,
               vallecula, epiglottis, each arytenoid cartilage, aryepiglottic folds, pyriform fos-
               sae, and esophageal area.

                                                                                                                                       (continued)

                      PROCEDURE PROTOCOL: EVALUATING THE LARYNX
                      WITH INDIRECT MIRROR EXAMINATION (continued)

                      Indications

                        Noncompliant patient with flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy
                        A patient who is allergic to topical anesthetics or decongestants used for the

                          flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy examination
                        To evaluate for base of tongue and/or laryngeal abnormalities

                      Contraindications

                       No absolute contraindications exist.

                      Equipment Needed

                        Gauze squares
                        Tongue blade
                        Hurricaine spray
                        Headlamp
                        Indirect nasopharyngeal/laryngeal mirror

                      Procedure Protocol

                        Seat the patient comfortably in an examination chair. Instruct the patient to
                          move the hips to the back of the chair, straighten the back, and lean forward
                          with mouth open and tongue extended.

                        Position yourself in front or to the side of the patient. Wear your headlight
                          throughout this procedure.

                        If gagging is expected with the patient, a topical anesthetic can be applied
                          (e.g., Hurricaine spray).

                        Using one hand, wrap a gauze square around the patient's tongue and hold
                          the tongue with your thumb and middle finger. Use your index finger to ele-
                          vate the patient's upper lip, as needed. Another option is to have the patient
                          hold the tongue, while you use a tongue depressor.

                        In the opposite hand, insert a small mirror. Use a mirror that has been pre-
                          viously "dipped" in a defog solution. Position the mirror so that it passes
                          between the tonsils and elevates the soft palate. Encourage the patient to
                          breathe deeply through the mouth and relax.

                        The reflected light in the small mirror from your headlight illuminates the
                          base of tongue and the laryngopharynx. A minor degree of rotation of the
                          laryngeal mirror assists in illuminating and examining the various anatomical
                          structures.

                        Instruct the patient to say "eee" to allow visualization of vocal cord mobil-
                          ity. Note any incomplete abduction or adduction of the vocal cords. Evaluate
                          the subglottic trachea through the vocal cords for narrowing or "subglottic
                          stenosis."

The Thyroid

                   Normally on examination, the thyroid is nonpalpable. However, if the thyroid is pal-
                   pable, it can be felt on either side of the trachea just superior to the sternal notch.
