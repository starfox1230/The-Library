The author and the publisher of this Work have made every effort to use sources believed to be reliable to provide
information that is accurate and compatible with the standards generally accepted at the time of publication. Because
medical science is continually advancing, our knowledge base continues to expand. Therefore, as new information
becomes available, changes in procedures become necessary. We recommend that the reader always consult current
research and specific institutional policies before performing any clinical procedure. The author and publisher shall
not be liable for any special, consequential, or exemplary damages resulting, in whole or in part, from the readers' use
of, or reliance on, the information contained in this book. The publisher has no responsibility for the persistence or
accuracy of URLs for external or third-party Internet websites referred to in this publication and does not guarantee
that any content on such websites is, or will remain,
accurate or appropriate.

CIP data is available from the Library of Congress.

  ceutical companies, health care organizations, and other qualifying groups. If you are interested in a custom book,
