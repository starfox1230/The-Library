Appendix 1. Radiation-Measuring Instrumentation and Quality Control Tests 
A Geiger-Mueller Counter has two main parts — a sealed tube, or chamber, filled with gas 
and an information display. Radiation enters the tube and when it collides with the gas, it 
pushes an electron away from the gas atom and creates an ion pair. A wire in the middle of 
the tube attracts electrons, creating other ion pairs and sending a current through the wire. 
The current goes to the information display and moves a needle across a scale or makes a 
number display on a screen. These devices usually provide "counts per minute," or the 
number of ion pairs created every 60 seconds. A Geiger counter indicates when an ion pair is 
created, but nothing about the type of radiation or its energy. 
Well Counters are used for high-sensitivity counting of radioactive specimens such as blood 
or urine samples or “wipes” from surveys of removable contamination (i.e., wipe testing). A 
well counter includes a cylindric scintillation crystal (most commonly thallium-doped sodium 
iodide) with a circular bore (well) for the sample, backed by a photomultiplier tube (PMT) 
and its associated electronics. Modern scintillation well counters are often equipped with a 
multichannel analyzer (MCA) for energy (i.e., isotope)-selective counting and an automatic 
sample changer for unattended counting of multiple samples. Because of their high intrinsic 
and geometric efficiencies (resulting from the use of a thick crystal and a well-type counting 
geometry, respectively), well counters are extremely sensitive and, in fact, can reliably be 
used only for counting activities up to approximately 37 kBq (0.001 mCi); at higher 
activities, dead-time counting losses become prohibitive and the measured counts, inaccurate.  
Scintillation Detection Systems use a substance that creates a flash of light when ionizing 
radiation interacts with it. Liquid scintillation counting is an analytical technique used to 
identify and quantify low levels of radioactivity, such as for contamination or for particulate 
emitting (b and a) radioactive samples. Solid scintillators are sensitive to gamma radiation 
and can measure dose rates in the µrem/hr range. 
An Ionization Chamber is an instrument used to measure the number of ions within a 
medium. It usually consists of a gas-filled enclosure between two conducting electrodes (the 
anode and cathode). When gas between the electrodes is ionized by any means, such as by 
gamma rays or other radioactive emission, the ions and dissociated electrons move to the 
electrodes of the opposite polarity, thus creating an ionization current that may be measured. 
Each ion essentially deposits or removes a small electric charge to or from an electrode, such 
that the accumulated charge is proportional to the number of like-charged ions. Ionization 
chambers can be open or sealed depending on their function. Open ionization chambers are 
typically used as personal dosimeters. Radioisotope dose calibrators are sealed ionization 
chambers widely used in the nuclear industry as they provide an output that is proportional to 
radiation dose and are calibrated to specific isotopes. 
Radio-thin-layer Chromatography (radio-TLC) is commonly used to analyze purity of 
radiopharmaceuticals or to determine the reaction conversion when optimizing radiosynthesis 
processes. In applications where there are few radioactive species, radio-TLC is preferred 
over radio-high-performance liquid chromatography due to its simplicity and relatively quick 
analysis time. Most approaches to radio-TLC were merely extensions or modifications of 
techniques that had been used in paper chromatography (PC).
