Iodinated contrast media 
Types of iodinated contrast 
•	 
There are two types of iodinated contrast media: ionic and nonionic (organic). 

•	 
Ionic compounds were developed first, and commonly used agents include diatrizoate (Gastrografin). 

•	 
Nonionic organic compounds covalently bind the iodine and do not dissociate into component molecules, thus they typically have fewer side effects. Commonly used nonionic agents include iopamidol (Isovue 370) and iohexol (Omnipaque 140, 180, 240, 300, 350). 

•	 
The higher the iodine concentration, the more dense it will appear with X-ray exposure. 

•	 
The agents are clear, water soluble solutions that are renally excreted and can be used for intravascular, intrathecal and oral or body cavity administration. 



Contrast-relative kidney injury 
Post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) 
•	 
Post-contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) is a decrease in renal function within 48 hours following intravascular (venous or arterial) administration of iodinated contrast. 

•	 
PC-AKI is a general entity that may result from any nephrotoxic process, including exposure to iodinated contrast (CIN, described below) or an unrelated cause. 


Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) 
•	 
Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a decrease in renal function caused by intravascular administration of iodinated contrast. Its exact pathophysiology is unclear. 

•	 
Recent studies show that CIN occurs much less commonly than previously thought. 

•	 
The most important risk factor for development of CIN is pre-existing renal insufficiency. 


In patients with eGFR =45 mL/min/1.73m2, intravascular iodinated contrast is not an independent risk factor of AKI. Even in patients with eGFR =30 and <45, the development of CIN is exceptionally rare. An eGFR <30 is the most commonly used threshold for stratifying CIN risk. 
•	 Note that gadolinium-based contrast media are not known to cause CIN. 
Prevention of contrast nephropathy 
•	 The main preventative strategies against CIN are to use the minimal dose of contrast possible and to adequately hydrate the patient (intravenous hydration is more effective). 
The use of sodium bicarbonate and N-acetylcysteine has been previously advocated but the effectiveness of these agents has not been proven. 
•	 
Administration of intravenous contrast to a patient with an eGFR <30 would require a careful assessment of risks and benefits on a case-by-case basis. 

•	 
The standard dose of intravenous iodinated contrast can generally be given to patients with end-stage renal disease on chronic dialysis. Careful attention should be paid to the volume status in these patients as theoretically the osmotic load increases intravascular volume. 



Iodinated intravenous contrast: General considerations 
Iodinated contrast and pheochromocytoma 
•	 It is safe to administer nonionic contrast media to patients with pheochromocytoma. Prior studies showed an increased in serum catecholamines after high-osmolality contrast agents, which are no longer in current use.

Iodinated contrast and thyroid uptake 
•	 Thyroid gland uptake of I-131 is reduced to about 50% one week after iodinated contrast injection. Therefore, if radioactive I-131 therapy is planned, iodinated contrast should be avoided for one month prior to I-131 therapy. 

Metformin and intravenous contrast 
•	 
Metformin is an oral anti-hyperglycemic agent that decreases hepatic glucose production and increases peripheral glucose uptake. Although exceptionally rare, there is an increased risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis in patients receiving intravenous iodinated contrast, thought to be due to PC-AKI and the resultant accumulation of metformin. 

•	 
There is no need to discontinue metformin in patients with normal renal function. In patients with multiple comorbidities, metformin should be discontinued at time of contrast administration and withheld for 48 hours. 

•	 
Note that it is not necessary to discontinue metformin prior to gadolinium-based contrast. 


Iodinated contrast and pregnancy 
•	 
Iodinated contrast crosses the placenta and enters the fetal circulation. No mutagenic or teratogenic effects have been observed in vivo; however, no controlled studies in pregnant patients have been performed. 

•	 
It is acceptable to administer iodinated contrast to a pregnant patient if medically necessary. It is recommended that a pregnant patient sign an informed consent form prior to undergoing an examination involving ionizing radiation and iodinated contrast. 


Iodinated contrast and breast feeding 
•	 
The plasma half-life of iodinated contrast is approximately two hours. Less than 1% of the administered maternal dose of iodinated contrast is excreted in the breast milk within 24 hours of maternal administration, and 1% of that dose may be absorbed by the infant’s gastrointestinal tract. The total infant absorbed dose is therefore approximately 0.01% of the administered maternal dose. 

•	 
Breast feeding mothers do not need to halt breast feeding. If the mother is concerned, abstaining from breast feeding for 24 hours (while pumping and discarding milk) would result in effectively zero fetal dose. 



Contrast extravasation 
•	 
Extravasation is the leakage of contrast into the soft tissues at the injection site. Although the risk of extravasation is not related to the injection flow rate, the use of automatic injectors can lead to a large extravasated volume of contrast media. 

•	 
Iodinated contrast is toxic to the soft tissues and skin, although serious adverse events are relatively rare following extravasation. The most common serious injury due to contrast extravasation is compartment syndrome. Less commonly, skin ulceration and tissue necrosis can occur. 

•	 
All patients with extravasation should be evaluated by the radiologist. Elevation of the extremity to decrease capillary hydrostatic pressure has been recommended, but is without supporting data. There is no evidence favoring warm or cold compresses, and both are used commonly. 

•	 
Surgical consultation should be obtained for progressive swelling and pain, altered tissue perfusion (decreased capillary refill), change in sensation or strength, skin ulceration or blistering.
