Measuring radiation 
Exposure, •	 Exposure is the charge of electrons liberated per unit mass of air. Exposure is measured in 
air kerma, Coulombs/Kg. absorbed 
•	 Air kerma (kinetic energy released per mass) describes the incident X-ray beam intensity 
dose, 

as the kinetic energy transferred from uncharged particles (photons) to charged particles 
equivalent 

(electrons). Air kerma is measured in Gray (J/Kg). 
dose, and effective dose •	 Air kerma (Gy) can be converted to absorbed dose (also quantified in Gy) by the R factor, which depends on kV and the atomic number (Z) of the absorbing tissue. Bone (Z = 12) absorbs much more energy than soft tissue (Z ~7.6). 
At 10 mGy air kerma, bone absorbs 40 Gy, tissue absorbs 11 Gy. 
•	 The equivalent dose (expressed in Sievert; Sv) is the absorbed dose in Gy multiplied by a radiation weighting factor (WR). 
WR depends on the linear energy transfer (LET) of the type of radiation. For diagnostic radiology using X-rays, WR = 1. An alpha particle has a high LET. 
•	 The effective dose (also expressed in Sv) is an estimation of radiation exposure that takes into account the equivalent dose to all organs exposed and each organ’s radiosensitivity. Effective dose = the sum of the absorbed dose (Gy) * WR * WT for all organs exposed. 
WT is the tissue weighting factor, which varies from 0.12 for radiosensitive organs (e.g., bone marrow, colon, lung, breast), to 0.01 for less sensitive organs, (e.g., bone, brain, and skin). 
Radiation •	 SI (système international) units including Gray and Sievert are almost universally used units rather than the older non-SI units. One notable exception is the Curie, which is still commonly used in nuclear medicine (typical dosing ranges are in millicuries). 
SI units Non-SI units

General radiography  
X-ray generator •	  X-ray photons are generated when high-energy electrons hit a target at the anode side of the circuit. For general radiography and CT, the target is made of tungsten (atomic symbol W). 99% of the electrons’ kinetic energy is converted to heat, and 1% is converted to X-rays.  
•	  90% of X-rays are produced from bremsstrahlung (nuclear field interaction). The maximum keV (energy) of the X-ray spectrum is the kV of the generator. The average keV ~1/3 max.  
•	  10% of X-rays are produced from characteristic radiation. A characteristic X-ray is produced when a high energy electron knocks a K-shell electron out of orbit.  
energetic electron needs to have  

 


 

 


 

 
•	  Tungsten: Atomic weight = 74; K-edge = 70 keV; characteristic X-rays < 70 keV  

Effect of kV on tube output •	 X-ray production is proportional to (kV)2. 
•	 
In practice, changing kV is complicated as a change in kV causes a change in characteristic X-ray, shifts spectrum to the right, and adds photons. 

•	 
h kV by 15% gh photons by 100% 

•	 
In general, increasing kV will decrease dose and decrease contrast when automatic exposure control is used. 


Heel effect  •	  The heel effect is due to attenuation  •	  The main contributor to the heel  
at the anode, causing fewer X-rays  effect is the anode angle  
at the anode side.  (typical anode angle ~15°).  
i anode angle • h heel effect  

All of these interactions deal with incoming photons. 


E = energy of incoming •	 Compton scatter: Proportional to (electron density)/E. Scattered photons go in photon (keV) all directions. 
Compton scatter dominates at >25 keV in soft tissue and >40 keV in bone. 

Z = Electron number 

•	 Photoelectric effect: Proportional to Z3/E3. Photoelectric effect dominates at <25 keV in soft tissue and <40  keV in bone. 

Energy from the ejected inner shell electron is absorbed locally (energetic electrons don’t travel very far); however, a 30 keV electron can cause significant damage via 1,000 ionizations (approximately 30 eV/ionization). 
coefficient 
µ (cm–1) 
*e-µt

•	 
N = N0 fraction transmitted = e-µt 

•	 
If µ is “small” (<0.1/cm), then µ is the proportion of photons that interacts with matter. 

•	 
If µ is “large” (>0.1/cm), then the formula above is used. 


N0 = initial number of photons 
N = transmitted number of photons after thickness t 

This is only true for weakly attenuating material. 
Example: If µ = 0.5/cm, then e-µt = 61% transmitted. 

Mass attenuation •	 Mass attenuation coefficient = (µ/.), where . = density 

coefficient 

•	 Because density is accounted for in the formula above, the mass attenuation coefficient is independent of density. 
Scatter and grids •	 In radiography, the typical scatter:primary ratio is 5–10:1 
•	 
Scatter i contrast 

•	 
Grid ratio = height/width 


Typical grid ratios in radiography are between 8–12 (the height of the grid is 8–12 times the width between grid elements). 
W 
H 

•	 
About 70% of primary radiation passes through the grid. 

•	 
Bucky factor is the relative h dose due to grid = incident/transmitted radiation The Bucky factor should not be confused with the grid ratio! Typical Bucky factor is 5–10 (e.g., h mAs from 40 g 200). 

•	 
h kV will h scatter (Compton effects dominate at higher kV). 

•	 
Grids not used for extremity radiography (bone is h Z and not very thick). 


Beam quality and half value layer (HVL) 

•	 
A “high quality” beam has low-energy photons filtered out. 

•	 
The half-value layer (HVL) is a measurement of the beam quality and is the thickness of material that attenuates 50% of the incident energy. 

•	 
HVL is dependent on photon energy. HVL h with h photon energy. 

•	 
Aluminum (Al) is the standard material for measuring HVL. 

•	 
Typical HVL for mammography is 0.3 mm Al. 

•	 
Typical HVL for radiography is 3 mm Al. State regulations require beam quality: HVL >2.5 mm Al at 80 kVp. 

•	 
Typical HVL for CT is 8–9 mm Al. 

•	 
Film optical density (OD) = log10(I0/It) = log10(incident/transmitted light intensity) OD of 1 g 10% photons transmitted through film OD of 2 g 1% transmitted OD of 3 g 0.1% transmitted 

•	 
Film “looks good” if the average OD is ~1.5. This occurs after approximately 5 µGy photons hit the film/screen. 

•	 
A characteristic curve logarithmically plots the relationship between radiation exposure (air kerma) and film optical density. 


The toe is the low-exposure region and the shoulder is the high exposure region. Fog is the baseline low-level darkening of film that occurs in the absence of radiation exposure. 
•	 
Latitude is the range of air kerma with satisfactory film density. A high-latitude film is ideal for imaging body parts with a wide variation of X-ray transmission (e.g., a chest radiograph). A high-contrast (low-latitude) film is ideal for accentuating image contrast in tissues with low subject contrast (e.g., mammography).

Photostimulable phosphor: Barium fluorohalide (BaFBr); used in computed 


radiography. Read out with red laser light (emits blue light). Dynamic range is 10,000:1 (vs. 40:1 for screen-film). Can be used with air kerma <0.1 µGy to 1000 µGy. 
•	 Scintillator: Cesium iodide (CsI); note that CsI also used as input phosphor in an 
image intensifier. Indirect: Absorbed X-rays first converted to light, which is then stored as charge. Advantage: K-edge 30-ish, good at absorbing X-rays. Disadvantage: Light spreads out g blur 
•	 Photoconductor: (Selenium) Direct: Absorbed X-rays directly converted to charge. Advantage: No light spreading, very sharp. Disadvantage: K-edge 13, poor X-ray absorber at standard radiography keV. Used in digital mammography.

Mammography X-ray 


generator and filters 

•	 
Molybdenum (Mo) target (K-edge 20 keV) generates characteristic X-rays at 17 and 19 keV. 

•	 
Mo filter ii low-energy X-rays (which do not contribute to imaging but add to 

radiation exposure) and i high frequency X-rays (which i contrast). Mo filter lets characteristic X-rays through. 

•	 
Average energy generated ~17 keV (typical rule that average energy ~1/3 to 1/2 max doesn’t apply since characteristic X-rays are so much more important). 

•	 
Rhodium (Rh) filter shifts spectrum to the right, used for thicker/denser breasts. 

•	 
Rh target/Rh filter used in conjunction for even thicker breasts.

h X-ray penetration  May be uncomfortable  
h density uniformity  
i scatter  
i dose  
i tissue overlap  
i focal spot blur  

Digital mammography •	 Pixel size ~80 µm; smallest visible microcalcifications ~150 µm 
•	 
Resolution ~3,000 x 4,000 pixels = 24 MB at 2 byte/pixel 

•	 
5 megapixel monitors needed for viewing 


Magnification •	 Magnification = SID/SOD 
mammography 
SID = source-image distance SOD = source-receptor distance 

•	 SID typically 65 cm, SOD typically 35 cm In the example below, SID = 65 cm, SOD = 35 cm, and magnification = 65/35 = 1.85 

OID = object-image distance 

•	 
If h SID (X-ray tube moved away) then exposure time will be too long. 

•	 
If i SID (X-ray tube moved closer) then there will be too much focal spot blur. 

•	 
No grid needed (air gap introduced). 

•	 
0.1 mm focal spot used. 

•	 
Magnification mammography technique summary: 25 mA current 3 second exposure 70 mAs. Because a grid is not employed, a lower total mAs is needed (compared to 100 


mAs with contact mammography using a grid). 
MQSA •	 The interpreting physician needs to have read 240 mammograms in the last 24 months of training during a 6 month period. 
•	 
A quality control program must be in place. 

•	 
Phantom must be tested weekly with an average glandular dose <3 mGy with a grid, and <1 mGy without a grid. 


Average glandular dose •	 Federal requirement that AGD <3 mGy per view per breast. (AGD) 
Note that the fluoroscopic dose limit of 100 or 200 mGy/min is the only other federal dose regulation. 
•	 A typical AGD is ~1.8–1.5 mGy per view per breast (digital slightly lower dose). 
Electronic magnification •	 If field of view (FOV) is i by a factor of two (e.g., from 10 cm to 5 cm), the reduced field of view is projected onto the entire output phosphor of the image intensifier, which will be 4 times dimmer. Therefore, skin exposure will be increased by a factor of 4 by the automatic exposure control. 
•	 Similarly, reducing the exposed area from 10 cm to 7 cm would increase patient entrance air kerma by a factor of two. 
Fluoro technique •	 Continuous fluoro runs at current of 1 to 5 mA (typically 3 mA), resulting in a very low air kerma/frame of approximately ~0.01 µGy. Compared to a standard chest X-ray exposure of 5 µGy, each fluoro frame has 500 times fewer incident photons. 
•	 There is a federal regulatory limit of 100 mGy/min entrance air kerma. High-dose fluoro with audible/visual alarms allows 200 mGy/min for large patients. 

Effects of fluoroscopy 
techniques on dose 

•	 
Increasing source to skin distance decreases dose due to inverse-square law. 

•	 
Increasing filtration reduces dose by removing low-energy X-rays that would be absorbed. 

•	 
Removing grid reduces dose (used in peds), at the risk of increasing scatter. 

•	 
Dose spreading (moving the beam around) reduces the maximum skin dose. Skin dose rate is about 10–30 mGy/min for continuous fluoroscopy. Maximum exposure rate 100 mGy/min or 200 mGy/min in high-level mode. At maximum permissible rate in high-level mode, 2 Gy can be delivered in 10 min! Large patients are more susceptible to skin injury. 

•	 
Magnification increases dose, as discussed above. 




CT physics 
Overview of CT •	 Computed tomography (CT) produces images by rotating a fan beam around the patient and determining the linear attenuation coefficients of each individual pixel using a reconstruction algorithm. 
Hounsfield units (HU) •	 A Hounsfield unit is a measure of relative CT attenuation.

•	 
10 HU = 1% difference in contrast. 

•	 
Gray matter and white matter differ in contrast by only 0.5%. 

•	 
A material with twice the attenuation of water attenuates 1000 HU. 


CT dosimetry •	 The computed tomography dose index (CTDI) is the average phantom dose for a single axial slice (one complete rotation without table motion), including scatter, measured in Gy. 
CTDI is measured with 16 cm and 32 cm phantoms. 16 cm will always have higher dose. 
•	 
CTDI w (weighted) = 2/3 CTDIp + 1/3 CTDIc CTDI p = peripheral CTDI = central 

•	 
CTDIvol = CTDI w/pitch 


c 

The pitch is related to the table speed. A pitch <1 will overscan and result in increased radiation exposure; conversely, a pitch >1 will skip areas but will decrease exposure. CTDIvol is the same for all scans, independent of scan length. CTDIvol should be less than reference values:
       Adult head: 75 mGy (16 cm phantom)       Adult abdomen: 25 mGy (32 cm phantom)        Pediatric abdomen: 20 mGy (16 cm phantom) 
Dose length product (DLP) and effective doses 

•	 The dose length product (DLP) is the best way to estimate radiation risk from 
CT. 

•	 
DLP = CTDIvol * scan length = mGy*cm 

•	 
One can obtain an effective dose in mSv from the DLP by using body-part 


specific conversion factors: Head 0.0023 mSv/mGy cm Neck 0.0054 Chest 0.019 Abd 0.017 Pelvis 0.017 Legs 0.0008 
•	 Example conversion: If DLP is 900 mGy*cm for an abdominal CT, the radiation exposure equals (900 mGy*cm) * (0.017 mSv/mGy cm) = 15.4 mSv. 
Typical effective doses (mSv) of common diagnostic exams 

•	  Radiography: PA and lateral chest radiograph: 0.1 mSv  •	  Interventional radiology: Cerebral angiography: 1–10 mSv  
Cervical spine radiograph: 0.2 mSv  Peripheral angiography: 5 mSv  
Lumbar spine radiograph: 1.5 mSv  Cardiac cath (diagnostic): 7 mSv  
Abdomen radiograph: 0.7 mSv  TIPS: 100 mSv  
Pelvic radiograph: 0.6 mSv  •	  CT:  
Mammography: 0.4 mSv  Head CT: 2 mSv

•	  Fluoroscopy: Upper GI series: 6 mSv  Chest CT: 7 mSv Abdomen CT: 8 mSv  
Barium enema: 8 mSv  Pelvis: 6 mSv  

Contrast •	 The most important factor for optimizing contrast is to increase the number of photons that reach the film (film density).

In screen film, contrast is related to screen latitude/gradient. 


Resolution and blur •	 Only three factors influence blur (resolution), none of which affect image contrast: 
1) Focal spot blur. 

2) Motion blur, which is related to exposure time. 
3) Receptor blur, which is related to intensifying screen thickness. Faster screens h blur.

•	 
A patient population includes normals and abnormals. The threshold to determine whether a test parameter is “negative” or “positive” can be set to optimize the ratio of true positives to false positives. 

•	 
In threshold 1 (thresh1; blue dashed line above), the decision threshold is chosen to balance true positives with false positives. This threshold is visualized on the ROC curve as the blue dot. 

•	 
Threshold 2 (thresh2; brown dashed line above) is lowered. When plotted on the ROC curve, thresh2 moves to the right, which increases the true positive fraction (increases sensitivity) and also increases the false positive fraction. 


DNA damage  •	  Free radicals mediate the majority of biological damage due to radiation.  
Syndromes  •	  Xeroderma pigmentosa:  •	 Ataxia telangiectasia:  
h sensitivity to UV light  h sensitivity to X-rays.  

Deterministic effects •	 Deterministic effects occur once the radiation exposure crosses a certain threshold and would not be expected to occur below that exposure. 
•	 
A decrease in peripheral lymphocyte count can occur after as little as =0.5 Gy exposure. 

•	 
Cataracts may occur after an eye dose of 2 Gy. The posterior pole is preferentially affected. For a given dose, high-LET radiation (neutrons and alpha particles) are much more effective at inducing cataracts compared to X-rays. 

•	 
Radiation-induced erythema can occur in 1–2 days, but may take up to 10–14 


days to develop. 2 Gy: Transient early erythema 6 Gy: Robust erythema 
•	 
Epilation occurs after about three weeks. 3 Gy: Temporary epilation 7 Gy: Permanent epilation 

•	 
Desquamation may begin 4 weeks after exposure. 15 Gy: Moist desquamation 

•	 
Vascular damage is expected for skin doses >20 Gy. 

•	 
Ulceration and depigmentation are late effects due to dermal damage. 

•	 
Sterility can be caused in males or females. Males: Temporary sterility after >0.15 Gy Females: Permanent sterility and early menopause after >3.5 Gy. 


Hereditary effects •	 The doubling dose is the dose required to double the spontaneous mutation rate when applied to a population. The doubling dose is approximately 1 Gy given to each member of the population. 
•	 The risk of hereditary effects (for an individual) is thought to be approximately 0.2% per Sv. For instance, the risk of a hereditary effect from a gonad dose of 100 mSv = 0.2% * 0.1 Sv = 0.02% 
Death by radiation Terminology: LD 50/X = lethal dose that kills 50% of the population in X days. For (whole-body radiation) 
instance, an LD 50/60 will kill 50% of the population in 60 days. 
•	 
3–4 Gy: LD 50/60 due to failure of hematopoietic system. 

•	 
10 Gy: LD 50/5 due to denuding of the GI tract lining (small bowel most sensitive). 

•	 
100 Gy: LD 50/2 due to cerebrovascular syndrome. 


Stochastic effects •	 Stochastic effects are random and carcinogenic. Stochastic effects arise after a latent period of several years. As the dose to an individual increases, there is an increased risk of developing cancer. Complicating the determination of a stochastic risk is the fact that cancer is a very common disease, there is a low level of background radiation present, and most people who receive medical radiation exposures do not have any ill effects. 
•	 
The risk of a stochastic effect depends on the dose, dose rate, and type of tissue exposed. 

•	 
The linear no threshold model is believed to provide the most accurate risk assessment for development of solid tumors, with a latency up to 25 years. The linear no threshold model assumes that there is no threshold required for a stochastic effect, and the risk of cancer increases linear with increasing exposure. 

•	 
The linear-quadratic function of dose is thought to best characterize the risk of developing leukemia, with a latency of 5–7 years. 


Radiation-induced cancer •	 Acute radiation exposure carries a risk of developing cancer of approximately 8%/Gy, based on Japanese nuclear bomb survivors. For instance, a 24% increase in cancer risk would require 4 Gy acutely (8 *4 = 24%). 
•	 
The risk of leukemia is approximately 1%/Sv for an acute dose. 

•	 
Chronic exposure (e.g., radiation worker) carries a risk of cancer of 4%/Gy.

Dose to general public allowed by medical radiation  •	  1 mSv/year, which is actually lower than the maximum dose of 5 mSv allowed to the fetus of a radiation worker.  
Dose limits by body part  •	  Eyes: 150 mSv/year  •	 Everything else: 500 mSv/year  
Occupational exposure (not pregnant)  •	  Max permissible effective dose = 50 mSv/year  

Background radiation •	 Background radiation varies by location, but averages about 3 mSv/year excluding medical radiation. 1 Gy (Sv) is required to double the mutation rate, so 3 mSv = 0.003 Sv = 0.3% increased risk of mutation above the baseline rate. 
•	 Radon exposure represents approximately 55% of background radiation. Radon is an alpha emitter with a half-life of three days. Its parent radionuclide is radium, with a half-life of 1600 years. 
Effective dose = Absorbed dose * WR * WT WR = 20 (h LET), and WT = 0.1 (only lung tissue irradiated) Radon exposure is thought to cause ~20,000 deaths/year.

T1 and T2 •	 Inherent tissue T1 and T2 characteristics depend on the longitudinal relaxation (T1) and transverse relaxation (T2) times of the protons in that tissue. 
•	 
Tissue signal abnormality is produced by alterations (prolongation or shortening) of the transverse or longitudinal relaxation of the tissue, which may be affected by various pathologic processes. 

•	 
MR image weighting (e.g., T1- or T2-weighted images) depends on the repetition time (TR) and echo time (TE) used to obtain images. 

•	 
T1 image contrast is dependent on TR, which is the interval between sequential radiofrequency pulses. The imaging appearance of specific tissues on T1-weighted images depends on how much longitudinal relaxation occurs between each TR. Images obtained with a short TR and a short TE are T1-weighted. 


Short T1 relaxation times g higher signal on T1-weighted images. Fat and subacute blood have short T1 relaxation times and therefore appear hyperintense on T1­weighted images. 
•	 T2 image contrast is dependent on TE, which is the interval between the application of the radiofrequency pulse and the collection of the signal. The imaging appearance of tissues on T2-weighted images depends on how much transverse relaxation (loss of proton phase coherence) occurs during each TE. Images obtained with a long TR and a long TE are T2-weighted. 
Slow loss of phase coherence g prolonged T2 relaxation times g hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Water has a long T2 relaxation time and therefore is hyperintense on T2-weighted images.

Decibel (dB) •	 The decibel is a measure of relative intensity between two sound intensities.

Cavitation 

•	 
Cavitation is the formation of bodies of gas and/or vapor by ultrasound energy. Cavitation is more likely to occur at high pressures and low frequencies. 

•	 
Stable cavitation is regular pulsation of persistent microbubbles. 

•	 
Transient cavitation is a more violent form of microbubble dynamics characterized by large size changes in bubbles before collapse. 


Safe ultrasound energy •	 No biologic effects have been observed with spatial peak temporal average intensities below 1 W/cm2. 
Tissue attenuation •	 Tissue attenuation is approximately 0.5 dB per cm per MHz. 
•	 For instance, a 4 MHz wave travelling 10 cm is attenuated 20 dB.

Physics: 1217 
Axial resolution  •	  Axial resolution quantifies the ability to separate objects lying along axis of the  
beam and is determined by spatial pulse length. Short pulses are achieved by  
damping of the transducer. The spatial pulse length (SPL) is approximately 2..  
axial resolution =  spatial pulse length 2  
For example, at 2 MHz, the SPL is ~2 mm and the axial resolution is ~1 mm.  
at 4 MHz, the SPL is ~1 mm and the axial resolution ~0.5 mm  
at 8 Mhz, the axial resolution is ~0.25 mm  
•	  Axial resolution does not vary with depth.  

Lateral resolution •	 The lateral resolution is the ability to resolve two adjacent objects. 
•	 
Lateral resolution improves with beam focusing and h number lines per frame. 

•	 
Lateral resolution is approximately 4x worse than axial resolution. 

•	 
Lateral resolution becomes worse with increasing depth. 


Elevational resolution •	 Elevational resolution is the resolution in the plane perpendicular to the plane of imaging. Elevational resolution is equivalent to slice thickness on cross-sectional imaging. 
•	 Elevational resolution is approximately equivalent to lateral resolution and also varies with depth. 
Near field and far field •	 The near field determines the maximum depth that can be imaged. It is not related to image quality at increasing depths. 
near ÿeld = r2 
° 
r = radius of transducer: If r doubles, near field h by 4 . = wavelength: If . doubles (h freq), near field i by 2 
•	 
The near field (where imaging is possible) is called the Fresnel zone. 

•	 
The far field (where the ultrasound beam diverges and imaging is impossible) is called the Frauenhofer zone. 


Pulse repetition frequency (PRF) 

•	 
Pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is the number of times the transducer outputs a pulse of sound waves per second. An increase in PRF causes an inversely proportional decrease in echo listening time. A high PRF therefore limits the maximum depth of tissue that can be imaged. 

•	 
PRF = Frame rate x lines per frame. 

•	 
A typical PRF is ~4 kHz g 0.25 ms (250 µsec) between pulses, which allows imaging of approximately 19.3 cm depth.

Decay and stability •	 The graph below demonstrates that as atomic number (Z) increases, stable elements tend to have slightly increased neutrons relative to protons.

Electron capture •	 Electron capture is similar to, and competes with, ß+ decay. A proton is converted to a neutron by capturing an e–, which usually comes from the K-shell. The resultant vacancy is filled by an outer shell e– and a characteristic X-ray or Auger e– is released. 
•	 
The net change is identical to ß+ decay: Z i 1 and N h 1, unchanged mass.
