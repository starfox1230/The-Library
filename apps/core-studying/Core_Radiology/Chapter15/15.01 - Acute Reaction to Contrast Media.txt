
Acute reaction to contrast media 
Contrast media reaction overview 
•	 
Acute reactions to iodinated and gadolinium-based intravenous contrast can be divided into allergic-type and non allergic-type mechanisms. Both allergic-type and non allergic-type reactions can range in severity from mild and self-limited to severe and life-threatening. 

•	 
Many of the side effects of contrast agents are due to the hyperosmolarity of the solution. 

•	 
Patients with asthma are at increased risk of an allergic-like contrast reaction. 

•	 
Seafood or shellfish or povidone-iodine allergies do not increase the risk of allergic reaction to iodinated contrast more so than any other allergy. 

•	 
Mild nausea, sensation of warmth, and flushing are considered physiologic and are not adverse reactions to contrast. 



Mild contrast reactions 
•	 
A mild contrast reaction is self-limited and does not require medical management. 

•	 
A vasovagal reaction to intravenous contrast is rare and is characterized by bradycardia and hypotension. Mild vasovagal reactions are usually self-limited and are not allergic in etiology. 

•	 
Urticarial reactions are mild allergic-type reactions, and include hives and mild angioedema. The symptoms of mild angioedema include scratchy throat, slight tongue or facial swelling, sneezing, and generally do not require medical management. 



Moderate contrast reactions 
•	 
Moderate contrast reactions are not immediately life-threatening but may require medical management. 

•	 
Moderate allergic-type reactions include severe urticaria, bronchospasm, moderate tongue/ facial swelling, and transient hypotension with tachycardia. 

•	 
Moderate non allergic-type reactions include significant vasovagal reaction, protracted nausea/vomiting, isolated chest pain, and hypertensive urgency. 



Severe contrast reactions 
•	 
Severe reactions to intravenous iodinated contrast may be immediately life-threatening. 

•	 
Allergic-type severe reactions include anaphylaxis and angioedema. Symptoms may be varied and include altered mental status, respiratory distress, diffuse erythema, severe hypotension, or cardiac arrest. 

•	 
Non allergic-type severe reactions include pulmonary edema, severe bronchospasm, hypertensive emergency, and seizure. 


Premedication to prevent contrast reaction 
•	 
In a patient with a known contrast allergy, a repeat contrast reaction is most likely to be similar to the prior reaction. However, the repeat reaction may be either more or less severe. Therefore, if IV contrast is necessary for a patient who has had a previous reaction, a premedication regimen is recommended, although contrast reactions may occur despite premedication. Intravenous contrast is generally contraindicated in patients who have had a prior severe allergic-type reaction. 

•	 
Elective premedication: Prednisone 50 mg PO at 13 hours, 7 hours, and 1 hour before the exam, plus diphenhydramine 50 mg (IV or PO) 1 hour before. 

•	 
Emergent premedication: Hydrocortisone 200 mg IV at 5 hours and 1 hour before contrast administration. Diphenhydramine is given 1 hour prior. Note that IV steroids have not been shown to be effective when given sooner than 4 hours before the contrast administration.

Classification of contrast reactions 
MILD: Signs and symptoms appear self-limited without evidence of progression.  
Physiochemotoxic Pre-treatment is not indicated  Allergic Pre-treatment is indicated  
Headache, dizziness, mild hypertension, anxiety, altered taste, vasovagal reaction that resolves spontaneously Limited: Nausea and/or vomiting Transient: Flushing, warmth, chills  Conjunctivitis, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sneezing Limited: Urticaria, pruritus, cutaneous edema, scratchy or itchy throat  

MODERATE: Signs and symptoms are more pronounced. Stable vital signs. Moderate degree of clinically evident focal or systemic signs or symptoms.  
Physiochemotoxic Pre-treatment is not indicated  Allergic Pre-treatment is indicated  
Vasovagal reaction that requires and is responsive to treatment Hypertensive urgency Isolated chest pain Protracted: Nausea and/or vomiting  Mild or no hypoxia associated with: Bronchospasm/wheezing No dyspnea associated with: Facial edema Hoarseness Throat tightness Diffuse: Urticaria, pruritus, erythema  

SEVERE: Signs and symptoms are often life-threatening. Unstable vital signs.  
Physiochemotoxic Pre-treatment is not indicated  Allergic Pre-treatment is indicated  
Vasovagal reactions resistant to treatment Convulsions/seizures Clinically manifest arrhythmias Hypertensive emergency Pulmonary edema  Diffuse erythema with hypotension Anaphylactic shock Laryngeal edema with stridor and/or hypoxia Bronchospasm/wheezing with significant hypoxia
