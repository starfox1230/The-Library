Gadolinium-based contrast media 
Immediate adverse reactions to gadolinium-based contrast 
•	 
Both mild and severe adverse reactions to gadolinium-based contrast are much more rare compared to iodinated contrast. Most adverse reactions to gadolinium-based contrast are mild such as nausea, vomiting, headache, or pain at the injection site. 

•	 
Allergic-type reactions to gadolinium are rare, seen in 0.004% to 0.7%. Serious anaphylactic reactions are exceedingly rare (<0.01%). 


Contrast extravasation 
•	 Gadolinium-based contrast is much less toxic to the skin and soft tissues compared to iodinated contrast. Evaluation and treatment of extravasation is similar for both types of contrast. 


Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) 
•	 
Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a highly morbid disease characterized by diffuse fibrosis of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, which may also involve the visceral organs. 

•	 
NSF is strongly associated with gadolinium exposure in patients with reduced renal function. The exact mechanism for development of NSF is unknown, but may involve dissociation of toxic free gadolinium in patients with reduced renal clearance. The free gadolinium may bind phosphate and precipitate in tissues, precipitating a fibrotic reaction. 

•	 
Patients with end-stage renal disease (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2) have between 1% and 7% chance of developing NSF even after a single exposure to a gadolinium-containing contrast agent. There has been only one established case of NSF in a patient with an eGFR >30. 

•	 
In general, gadolinium-based contrast should not be given to patients on dialysis or with eGFR <30 or AKI. Although it is exceedingly rare for NSF to develop in a patient with eGFR between 30 and 59, eGFR may fluctuate daily in these patients. For this reason, caution should be employed for patients on the lower end of this spectrum.  

•	 
Different brands and formulations of gadolinium-based contrast are associated with varying rates of NSF. Group I agents associated with unconfounded cases of NSF include gadodiamide, gadopentetate dimeglumine, gadoversetamide. 



Gadolinium-based contrast in pregnancy and breast feeding 
Gadolinium-based contrast and pregnancy 
•	 Gadolinium-based contrast should not be administered during pregnancy. Gadolinium-based contrast crosses the placenta. Although never demonstrated to cause harm, gadolinium chelates may accumulate in the amniotic fluid and remain there indefinitely, with risk of dissociation of the toxic free gadolinium ion. 
Gadolinium-based contrast and breast feeding 
•	 
The plasma half-life of gadolinium-based contrast is two hours. Less than 0.04% of the administered maternal dose is excreted in the breast milk within 24 hours of maternal administration, and 1% of that dose may be absorbed by the infant’s gastrointestinal tract. The total infant absorbed dose of gadolinium is therefore approximately 0.0004% of the administered maternal dose. 

•	 
It is likely safe for the mother to continue breast feeding. There is no information to suggest that oral ingestion of such a tiny amount of gadolinium-containing contrast may be harmful to the fetus.
