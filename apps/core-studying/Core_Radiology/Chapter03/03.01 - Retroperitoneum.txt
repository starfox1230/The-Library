Retroperitoneum 
Retroperitoneal anatomy 

• The retroperitoneum can be separated into three compartments by the anterior and posterior renal fascia and the lateroconal fascia.

Retroperitoneal disease 
Liposarcoma 

Retroperitoneal liposarcoma: Axial contrast-enhanced nephrographic phase (left image) and coronal excretory phase CT shows a predominantly fat-attenuation mass (yellow arrows) in the right posterior pararenal space, with Zuckerkandl’s fascia (red arrows) separating the mass from the perirenal space. Pathology showed a well-differentiated adipocytic liposarcoma.

• 
Liposarcomas are the most common primary retroperitoneal malignant tumors; 10–15% of all liposarcomas arise from the retroperitoneum. 

• 
Liposarcomas are divided into five histological groups. The well-differentiated subtype, mainly comprised of fat, is the most common and also least aggressive. The other subtypes, in order of increasing aggressiveness, include myxoid, round-cell, pleomorphic, and dedifferentiated. 

• 
The more aggressive subtypes often have minimal macroscopic fat and may be indistinguishable from other soft tissue masses. 


Retroperitoneal fibrosis 

Retroperitoneal fibrosis: Axial contrast-enhanced CT through the kidneys (left image) shows bilateral nephroureteral stents and left hydronephrosis (red arrow). Axial image through the lower abdomen (right image) shows a soft tissue mass (yellow arrows) surrounding the common iliac arteries, with no significant 
narrowing of the vessels.

• 
Retroperitoneal fibrosis is a rare inflammatory disorder associated with fibrosis deposition in the retroperitoneum, often leading to ureteral obstruction. 

• 
Unlike malignant retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, retroperitoneal fibrosis rarely displaces 


the aorta away from the spine. 
Retroperitoneal hematoma 

Retroperitoneal hematoma with active extravasation: Axial contrast-enhanced CT (left image) shows a heterogeneous isodense mass in the left paravertebral region indistinct from the left psoas, with anterior extension along the left perirenal space. A punctate hyperdensity (yellow arrow) is seen within the mass which demonstrates blush on delayed phase (right image; yellow arrow), representing active extravasation. Also seen is a subtle fluid-fluid level (hematocrit effect; red arrow). This patient was on anticoagulation. 
• Retroperitoneal hemorrhage can occur in the setting of trauma, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, renal masses (e.g., renal angiomyolipoma or hemorrhagic renal cyst), or as complication of femoral vascular access. Spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage can occur in patients who are anticoagulated. 

Coronal T2-weighted MRI Coronal post-contrast T1-weighted MRI with fat supp. 
Retroperitoneal hematoma due to ruptured hemorrhagic renal cyst: There is a complex cystic mass of the right upper pole (yellow arrows), with internal 
foci of hyperintense signal on T1-weighted images 
(red arrows), in keeping with blood products. There 
is a large retroperitoneal hematoma inferior to the 
right kidney (blue arrows) with foci of blood products (green arrows). Careful comparison of the pre- and post-contrast images and subtraction images (not shown) showed no enhancement. It is important not to confuse the regions of T1 shortening (bright signal) with active extravasation; such regions are due to 
methemoglobin in evolving blood products. 
• Retroperitoneal bleeds may explain acute anemia in patients without an identifiable source 
of bleeding on physical exam. 
• To assess for retroperitoneal bleed, noncontrast CT is a reasonable choice as an initial study to more rapidly image the patient. However, intravenous contrast can be helpful to diagnose active extravasation, especially if a large retroperitoneal hematoma is clinically suspected.
