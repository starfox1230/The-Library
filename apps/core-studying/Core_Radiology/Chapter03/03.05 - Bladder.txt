Bladder 
Bladder stones 
• 
Risk factors for bladder stones include urinary stasis (most often bladder outlet obstruction) and chronic inflammation (e.g., from infection or foreign body). 

• 
An off-midline bladder stone should raise concern for a bladder mass or enlarged prostate which displaces the bladder stone, or a stone within a ureterocele or a bladder diverticulum. 


Bladder transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) 
• Transitional cell carcinoma is by far the most 
common bladder cancer. 
• TCC typically presents with painless 
hematuria, more commonly seen in older 
males with risk factors such as smoking and 
aromatic amines. 

• Bladder cancer spreads through the wall 
of the bladder. Organ-confined disease can 
be divided into non-muscle-invasive (70%; 
typically resected endoscopically) and muscle-
invasive (25%; typically treated with radical 
cystectomy/nodal dissection). 
• Metastatic bladder cancer (5%) is treated with 
systemic therapy. 

• If bladder cancer is clinically suspected in the context of macroscopic hematuria, cystoscopy 
and urine cytology are warranted regardless if a lesion is detected on CT urogram. 



MRI Axial T2 (top left image) shows polypoidal mass arising from the right posterolateral bladder wall with a T2 hypointense stalk (yellow arrows). Axial T1 post-contrast (top right image) shows avidly enhancing mass with feeding vessels from the right internal iliac artery branches. ADC (bottom right image) show restricted diffusion of the “cap” of the tumor rather than the stalk. T2 with fat sat (bottom left) is key as it shows T2 intermediate signal involving the bladder wall and invading the muscularis propria (red arrows), stage IIb disease.

Bladder adenocarcinoma 
• 
Adenocarcinoma of the bladder is rare but it is usually associated with an urachal remnant. 

• 
The fetal urachus extends from the bladder dome to the umbilicus. It should 


be obliterated after birth, but may 
persist as a urachal anomaly (discussed in the pediatric 
Imaging section). 



Bladder trauma 
• 
CT cystography/cystogram is the standard test to evaluate for suspected bladder rupture. 

• 
Full distension of the bladder is needed to evaluate for bladder rupture. Delayed imaging of an intravenous contrast study with opacification of excreted urine is not sensitive enough, as it does not adequately distend the bladder, and is not the standard of care. 

• 
To perform a CT cystogram, a total volume of at least 300 mL (or as much as the patient can tolerate) of dilute water-soluble contrast (50 mL of IV contrast mixed in 500 mL of warm saline) is instilled into the bladder by gravity, with the bag raised 40 cm above the bladder. 

• 
Male patients with bladder injury may have associated urethral injury. If there is blood at the urethral meatus or if there is gross hematuria, a retrograde urethrogram should be performed prior to Foley catheter placement. 

• 
Bladder injury can be classified as extraperitoneal (most common), intraperitoneal, or 


combined. 

Extraperitoneal bladder rupture 

GU: 274 

Extraperitoneal bladder rupture (continued) 
• Extraperitoneal bladder rupture is defined as rupture of the bladder outside of the peritoneal space. Extraperitoneal bladder rupture is at least twice as common as 
intraperitoneal rupture. 
• Extraperitoneal bladder rupture is more commonly associated with pelvic fractures compared to intraperitoneal rupture. It is typically caused by direct laceration of the bladder 
by a bone fragment. 

• 
The molar tooth sign describes the characteristic inverted U appearance of extravasated contrast in the extraperitoneal space of Retzius, which mimics a molar tooth. 

• 
Extraperitoneal bladder rupture is typically managed conservatively, by placement of a 


urinary catheter. 

Intraperitoneal bladder rupture 

Coronal and sagittal contrast-enhanced CT demonstrates a focal wall defect at the bladder dome (arrows) and intraperitoneal fluid interdigitated between loops of bowel. 

Axial CT cystogram in another patient shows intraperitoneal contrast extravasation (arrows) between numerous loops of bowel, diagnostic of an 
intraperitoneal bladder rupture. 

• 
Intraperitoneal bladder rupture occurs with disruption of the bladder dome and peritoneum, causing resultant extravasation of urine into the peritoneal space. 

• 
The mechanism of intraperitoneal bladder rupture is thought to be through pressure forces 


on a full bladder causing bursting at the dome into the peritoneum. 
• 
The pathognomonic imaging finding on CT cystogram is intraperitoneal contrast interdigitating between loops of bowel. 

• 
Intraperitoneal bladder rupture is typically treated surgically.
