• Penile fracture is a urologic emergency. It is defined as rupture (usually unilateral) of a corpus cavernosum 
and surrounding tunica albuginea. It is usually caused by external force on an erect penis during 
intercourse. A cracking sensation, severe pain, and 
rapid swelling are typical. 
• 
Surgical repair is recommended for suspected or confirmed tear of the tunica albuginea and/or with urethral injury. 

• 
Imaging (US or MRI) may be required to confirm the penile fracture in patients with severe pain/swelling that precludes physical examination, or atypical presentation. Penile fracture is demonstrated by discontinuity of the tunica albuginea. MRI is more sensitive and provides best assessment of tear location and extent. 



MRI of the prostate 
Prostate anatomy 

• 
The prostate consists of the peripheral zone (PZ), central zone (CZ), transitional zone (TZ) and the anterior fibromuscular stroma (AFM). 

• 
In younger men, the central gland is composed mostly of the central zone; however, the transition zone enlarges as benign prostatic hyperplasia develops. These changes result in the central gland becoming predominantly composed of transition zone in older males. 


• 
The seminal vesicles (SV) produce and secrete seminal fluid (50–80% of ejaculate volume). 

• 
The seminal vesicles are located posterior to the bladder/distal ureters and superior to the 


prostate gland, joining the distal portion of the vas deferens to form the ejaculatory duct, which in turn drains into the prostatic urethra. 
• On MRI, they are seen as fluid-containing structures with thin septa. They show high signal 
on T2-weighted imaging and low signal on T1-weighted imaging. 
• 
Bilateral SV agenesis is seen in 60–70% of patients with cystic fibrosis, likely related to luminal obstruction by thick secretions. These patients have normal kidneys. 

• 
Congenital SV cysts or SV hypoplasia are often associated with other GU anomalies (e.g., ipsilateral renal agenesis, ADPKD). 


Utricle cyst 

Coronal (left image) and sagittal (right image) T2-weighted MRI show a midline cystic lesion in the prostate, at the posterior aspect of the urethra, consistent with a prostatic utricle cyst (arrows). 
• An utricle cyst is a midline cystic structure within the prostate, usually located posterior to 
the urethra. Utricle cysts communicate freely with the urethra and can result in post-void dribbling. 
• Utricle cysts are remnants of the Mlerian duct system and are associated with 
hypospadias. They are always midline and diagnosed in younger patients (10–20 years of age) whereas Müllerian duct cysts occur in 30–40-year-old patients and can be found 
anywhere along the path of regression from scrotum to utricle. 
• On ultrasound, a utricle cyst is seen as midline anechoic cyst posterior to the prostatic urethra. On MRI, they demonstrate high signal on T2-weighted imaging, but can have variable signal if they develop superimposed infection or hemorrhage. 
Prostatitis 
• 
Bacterial prostatitis is fairly common (prevalence of 10%) and can manifest as acute or chronic disease. Fluctuating PSA levels or decreasing PSA levels with antibiotic therapy raises suspicion for prostatitis. 

• 
Acute bacterial prostatitis is less common and typically presents with local (painful urination, hematuria) and systemic (fever, malaise) symptoms. It usually occurs in young men from intra-prostatic reflux of infected urine, but can occur following instrumentation (e.g., biopsy). 

• 
Chronic bacterial prostatitis usually occurs in older men with undertreated/recurrent acute prostatitis or lower urinary tract obstruction. Chronic prostatitis is more indolent and 


presents with local symptoms only. 

Prostatitis (continued) 
• 
Prostatitis can be diffuse or focal and typically occurs within the peripheral zone. On MRI, regions of T2 hypointense signal and mild-moderate diffusion restriction are due to inflammatory cellular infiltrates. Both prostatitis and prostate cancer show increased and early enhancement. Compared to prostate cancer, chronic prostatitis shows less diffusion restriction. 

• 
Another type of prostatitis, granulomatous prostatitis, is usually idiopathic and self-limited.  



Prostate cancer 
Overview of prostate cancer imaging 
• 
Most prostate cancers (90%) occur in the peripheral zone. 

• 
Histologically, prostate cancers are classified by the Gleason scale (1–5) where the first number is the predominant pattern and the second number is the secondary pattern. 

• 
The most important goal of MRI is to distinguish between surgical and nonsurgical disease. Cancer that is contained within the gland (tumor stage T2) is generally amenable to radical prostatectomy, while cancer that has spread outside of the gland is typically treated non-surgically (e.g., anti-androgen and radiation therapy). 

• 
MRI may not detect all prostate cancers: low Gleason (<7) grade prostate cancers are 


typically not detectable; some cancers are not T2 hypointense; central zone cancers are 
difficult to detect on T2-weighted images; and cancer conspicuity is decreased if the peripheral zone is not T2 hyperintense due to underlying disease, such as chronic prostatitis. 
• Pitfalls of imaging include prostatitis and involutional changes from androgen-deprivation 
therapy which may appear as abnormal T2 hypointense lesions. 
• Post-biopsy normal prostatic tissue is T1 hyperintense due to high concentration of citrate that causes more bleeding (right image, yellow arrows). Neoplastic tissue does not produce as much citrate and will bleed less, resulting in the hemorrhage exclusion sign (red arrows). 

Post-biopsy T1-weighted post-contrast 
MR with fat suppression demonstrates T1 hyperintense bleeding within normal 
prostatic tissue peripherally (yellow arrows). Prostate cancer (red arrows) does not bleed, resulting in the hemorrhage exclusion sign. 

• Prostate cancer typically shows: (1) restricted diffusion with high signal on high B-value DWI and low signal on ADC, (2) low T2 signal, and (3) early enhancement relative to the 
surrounding peripheral zone. 
DWI assessment is usually qualitative, not quantitative, but active research is under way to determine thresholds for ADC value(s). 
• MRI spectroscopy of prostate cancer may show elevated choline and depressed citrate 
peaks compared to normal prostate, but it is not routinely performed in most centers. 
Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 
• 
Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) was designed to provide a global standard for reporting and interpreting multiparametric prostate MRI. Using PI-RADS system improves communication of clinically significant cancer, increases confidence in benign disease and dormant malignancies, and reduces unnecessary biopsies and treatments. 

• 
Assignment of a PI-RADS score (last updated 2019 v2.1) is based on MRI findings only. PSA or clinical findings are not included. The likelihood of clinically significant cancer is reported on a scale of 1–5, with a progressively increased likelihood with increasing score: 


PI-RADS 1: Clinically significant cancer is highly unlikely (0%). PI-RADS 2: Clinically significant cancer is unlikely (10%). PI-RADS 3: Equivocal (16–20%). PI-RADS 4: Clinically significant cancer is likely (21–86%). PI-RADS 5: Clinically significant cancer is highly likely (93%). 
• PI-RADS assessment is based on T2-weighted images (T2WI), diffusion weighted images (ADC/DWI), and dynamic contrast imaging (DCE). PI-RADS category assignment is weighted to a specific sequence according to zonal anatomy. 
Peripheral Zone (PZ) Transitional Zone (TZ) 


Any extraprostatic extension is PI-RADS 5 

• 
For transitional zone (TZ) lesions, T2WI should be used to assign a PI-RADS category, but it is correlated to ADC/DWI. Transitional zone lesions are measured on T2WI. 

• 
For peripheral zone (PZ) lesions, ADC/DWI should be used to assign a PI-RADS category, but it is correlated to T2WI. Peripheral zone lesions are measured on ADC images. 

• 
DCE can act as a “tie-breaker” for peripheral zone lesions when ADC/DWI characteristics are equivocal for malignancy (a score of 3). An equivocal peripheral zone lesion should be upgraded to PI-RADS 4 if DCE is positive. 

• 
If a transitional zone lesion has a T2WI score of 2 or 3, correlation with DWI imaging characteristics is required. A high DWI score (see chart below) would upgrade the lesion. 

• 
For both PZ and TZ lesions, any extraprostatic extension makes the lesion PI-RADS 5. Evaluation of the tumor margin should be performed in three planes. If the tumor is contiguous with the prostatic capsule, it has a higher risk of extracapsular invasion. The neurovascular bundles 


should be carefully examined where they abut the peripheral zone posterolaterally. 
• Studies have shown that PI-RADS score correlated with Gleason score =3 + 4 disease, 
whereas Gleason <4 disease generally does not have a MRI correlate.  
• Note that PI-RADS does not address the use of MRI for detection of suspected recurrent prostate cancer following therapy, progression during surveillance, or use of MRI for evaluating other parts of the body involved with prostate cancer. 

Prostate cancer staging 
• Prostate cancer uses the TNM staging system. 
T: If the tumor is confined within the prostate or extends beyond the capsule (involvement of seminal vesicles or neurovascular bundle). If there is tumor fixation or invasion into other adjacent structures (e.g., bladder, rectum). 
N: Metastasis to regional lymph nodes (pelvic, hypogastric, sacral, internal and external iliac). 
M: Non-regional lymph node involvement (aortic, common iliac, inguinal, and supraclavicular), bone, and 
distant organ involvement. 

• 
MRI can help determine N or M status, although PET/CT or CT is more commonly used for nodal staging. If PSA is high or there is suspicion for metastasis, a bone scan is usually performed to evaluate for osteoblastic bone metastasis. 

• 
Staging example: T2a prostate cancer, which can be treated with radical prostatectomy. 








In this case, the focus of prostate cancer is entirely confined within the gland. The tumor involves less than one-half of one lobe for a stage of T2a. Because the tumor is so small, the advanced techniques of diffusion and dynamic contrast enhancement are helpful to increase specificity. 
• Staging example: T3b N1 prostate cancer, which is typically treated nonsurgically. 






In this case, the tumor involves most of the peripheral zone of both lobes and clearly demonstrates extra-glandular spread, making the tumor T3. Because the tumor invades the seminal vesicles it is T3b: If it only extended out of the capsule, but the seminal vesicles were preserved, it would be T3a. 
The presence of regional lymph nodes is N1. 

Advanced MRI techniques would not add much in this case because the anatomic imaging demonstrates 
malignant behavior.
