Ureter 
Overview of ureteral imaging 
CT urography (CTU) indications and protocol 
• 
The goal of CT urography (CTU) is to evaluate the kidneys, ureters and bladder. The key  to successful imaging is to opacify and optimally distend the ureters and bladder. 

• 
One of the most common indications for CTU is the evaluation of hematuria. Hematuria may be caused by a urinary tract calculus, renal mass (e.g., renal cell carcinoma), and urothelial tumor (e.g., transitional cell carcinoma). 

• 
Protocols vary by institution. Typically, patients are given 900 mL of water PO and either 250 mL of IV saline or 10 mg of IV furosemide to optimally distend the ureters and bladder. 

• 
In adults =35 years of age, CTU is performed as a three-phase exam: 


Unenhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis. 
Nephrographic phase through the kidneys (100 seconds after IV contrast administration). Excretory phase of the abdomen and pelvis (15 minutes after IV contrast). 
• A split-bolus (dual-phase) technique decreases radiation exposure in patients under age 35: 
Unenhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis. 
Combined nephrographic/excretory phase (8 minutes delay after first IV contrast bolus and 100 seconds after the second bolus). 


Malignant ureteral disease 
Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) 

Multifocal transitional cell carcinoma: Coronal CT (left image) from the excretory phase of a CT urogram shows a sessile mass within the left lateral aspect of the bladder (red arrows) and a filling defect within the proximal left ureter (yellow arrow). Curved multiplanar reformation from the same study (right image) better shows the proximal ureteral filling defect (arrow).

• Although upper tract malignancy is relatively rare, transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) is the 
most common ureteral neoplasm. 
• The typical CTU appearance is of a single short segment of wall thickening, stricture, or filling defect at the excretory phase. However, multiple filling defects may be seen in 40%. Given the propensity of TCC for multifocal disease, the bladder should be evaluated for a synchronous mass. 

Benign ureteral masses 
Fibroepithelial polyp 
• Fibroepithelial polyp is the most common benign tumor of the ureter. It typically affects the proximal ureter. Fibroepithelial polyp features a long stalk and can be large. They usually 
appear as an elongated smooth tubular lesion. CTU best shows the lesion on the coronal images in the excretory phase. Transurethral excision is the treatment of choice. 
Urothelial papilloma 
• Urothelial papilloma is a rare benign neoplasm that may involve the bladder or ureter. The 
mass may become quite large and mimic a malignancy. 
Inverted papilloma 
• Inverted papilloma is a benign mass with a central core of urothelium. 


Inflammatory and infectious ureteral disease 
Ureteritis cystica 

Pyeloureteritis cystica: 
Frontal projection intravenous pyelogram shows multiple small nodular filling defects along the renal pelvis (left image) and ureter (right image). 
• 
Ureteritis cystica is a benign response to chronic urinary tract inflammation, such as chronic infection or stone disease. Several small subepithelial cysts can be found unilaterally in the proximal third of the ureter and renal pelvis. Ureteritis cystica does not have any malignant potential. 

• 
Imaging characteristically shows multiple tiny filling defects in the ureter. 

• 
The same disease entity can affect the renal pelvis (called pyelitis cystica) and bladder (called cystitis cystica). 


Leukoplakia (squamous metaplasia) 
• 
Leukoplakia, also known as squamous metaplasia, is a rare urothelial inflammatory condition named for the characteristic white patch that it produces. Leukoplakia is not thought to be premalignant when the renal collecting system is involved, although there is an association between squamous cell carcinoma and bladder leukoplakia. 

• 
Imaging shows a flat mass or focal thickening of the renal pelvic or ureteral wall that may produce a characteristic corduroy appearance. 


Malacoplakia 
• 
Malacoplakia (soft plaque) is a rare chronic inflammatory granulomatous condition associated with chronic urinary tract infection (usually Escherichia coli) that is typically seen in middle-age women. It is not premalignant. The bladder is the most frequently involved organ, followed by the renal parenchyma, upper urinary tract, and urethra. 

• 
Imaging shows multiple flat filling defects that characteristically involve the distal ureter 


and/or bladder. 
Ureteral tuberculosis 
• Multifocal ureteral stenoses are suggestive of ureteral tuberculosis, even more so if there is also evidence of renal tuberculosis (parenchymal calcification and scarring) and/or bladder tuberculosis (small capacity bladder with a thickened wall). 



Differential diagnosis of a ureteral filling defect 
• The primary concern of a ureteral filling defect on CT urography is ureteral malignancy. 
• Ureteral malignancy, of which transitional  • Leukoplakia.  
tial oflfilling defect cell carcinoma is by far the most common.  • Infectious debris (e.g., a mycetoma).  
diff erenuretera• Ureteral calculus, which is almost always visible on pre-contrast images. • Blood clot.  • Sloughed renal papilla. • Benign ureteral mass (e.g., fibroepithelial polyp).  
• Malacoplakia (multiple flat defects).  


Structural ureteral lesions 
Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJ obstruction) 

Coronal excretory phase CT and maximum intensity projection image show moderate left hydronephrosis without hydroureter, thought to represent primary UPJ obstruction. 
• 
Obstruction of the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) can be either primary or secondary to infection, stones, or prior surgery. 

• 
Primary UPJ obstruction may be due to a congenital aperistaltic segment of ureter, high insertion of the ureter on the renal pelvis, or crossing vessels causing extrinsic compression. 

• 
The key imaging finding is a dilated renal pelvis with a normal caliber ureter. 


Ureterocele 
• 
An ureterocele is a focal dilation of the most distal portion of the ureter which protrudes into the bladder (cobra head sign). An ureterocele may be orthotopic or ectopic. 

• 
An orthotopic ureterocele is seen with a normally inserting ureter, and is seen most commonly in adults. Orthotopic ureteroceles are also known as simple, adult-type, and intravesicular ureteroceles. Orthotopic ureteroceles are usually asymptomatic. 

• 
An ectopic ureterocele is seen in the setting of a duplicated collecting system, with ectopic insertion of the upper pole ureter into the bladder (Weigert-Meyer rule), and is usually 


diagnosed in children. 
• A pseudoureterocele represents intussusception of the distal ureter into the bladder, which may be due to tumor, radiation cystitis, or vesicoureteral junction stone. 

Duplicated ureter with ureterocele: Coronal contrast-enhanced CT (top images) show a duplicated left ureter. There is hydronephrosis of the upper pole moiety and marked dilation of the upper pole ureter (yellow arrows). Axial (bottom left image) and coronal (bottom right image) CT show the dilated ureter terminating within a ureterocele (red arrows). The dilated upper pole ureter inserts slightly posteriorly relative to the lower pole ureter (not shown) and represents an ectopic ureterocele.
