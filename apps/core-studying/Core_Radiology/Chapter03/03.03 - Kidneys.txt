Kidneys 
Renal imaging patterns 
Sonographic appearance of kidneys 
• 
Grayscale ultrasound (US) is used to assess the renal parenchyma (masses, scarring, calcification), to evaluate for stones, and to evaluate for hydronephrosis. The proximal ureter can also be seen in some patients allowing for evaluation of proximal hydroureter. 

• 
Color Doppler can be used to evaluate the main renal arteries for pathology (renal artery 


stenosis, aneurysms) or for donation evaluation. Evaluation of the main renal vein can be conducted to assess for clots or tumor thrombus. Renal Doppler can also be used to assess the smaller intra-parenchymal vessels and calculate the resistive index (non-specific, suggests a number of entities including ureteral obstruction and intrinsic renal disease). 
• Contrast-enhanced US (CEUS): Contrast-enhanced ultrasound permits evaluation of microvascular blood flow in real time, which is too small to detect by color Doppler. Among other things, it can be used to detect subtle solid renal masses and better characterize complex cystic masses. Of note, US contrast agents do not affect renal function and can be useful in patients with CKD. 

Sagittal grayscale ultrasound of a normal right 
kidney. The renal cortex is normally isoechoic to 
the hepatic parenchyma. Medullary pyramids 
are seen as hypoechoic triangles bordering to the renal sinus. The renal sinus is surrounded by 
hyperechoic fat. The major and minor calyces are 
usually not apparent unless hydronephrosis is present. 
Diffusely increased echogenicity 
• 
Echogenic kidneys are most commonly due to medical renal disease, such as diabetic nephropathy, glomerulosclerosis, acute tubular necrosis, etc. 

• 
HIV nephropathy can cause bilateral enlarged and echogenic kidneys. 


Focally increased echogenicity 
• 
Focal increase in echogenicity can be caused by renal lesions or areas containing fat, calcium, and air. 

• 
Angiomyolipoma (AML). An echogenic renal mass is suggestive of AML (due to internal fat content), particularly when isoechoic to the sinus fat. 


• 
Renal calculus. 

• 
Milk of calcium, caused by crystals precipitating out of supersaturated solution. 

• 
Sloughed papilla, secondary to papillary necrosis, may appear as an echogenic mass in the collecting system (often calcified). 

• 
Intrarenal gas (e.g., infection, recent nephrostomy tube placement). 

• 
Malignant neoplasm (atypical appearance).

echogenic renal mass 
CT/MR imaging appearance of kidneys 
• 
On standard abdominopelvic CT, conducted in portal venous phase (70 seconds post-injection), the renal parenchyma is relatively homogeneous (similar to nephrographic phase as described below), but can show more corticomedullary differentiation depending on the exact timing of image acquisition post-injection. 

• 
Phases of contrast in renal/ureteral imaging: 


Noncontrast: Unenhanced imaging is used to assess for intralesional fat, renal stones, parenchymal calcifications, and hemorrhage. It also provides baseline attenuation of renal lesions. 
Arterial phase (20–40 seconds post-injection) imaging can be performed to evaluate the renal vasculature, primarily for surgical planning. In this phase, there is significant corticomedullary differentiation. 
The nephrographic phase (100 seconds post-injection) is used to evaluate the renal parenchyma (neoplasm, scarring, inflammation). In this phase, the renal parenchyma appears homogeneous. 
The excretory phase (8–15 minutes post-injection, depending on protocol) is used to assess for urothelial abnormalities (calyceal diverticulum, papillary necrosis, tumors, stricture). Lasix can be used to maximize contrast excretion. This phase can obscure ureteral stones. 

CT nephrographic phase. CT excretory phase. 
Absent nephrogram 
• An absent nephrogram describes the absence of normal renal parenchymal enhancement in 
the renal fossa, historically seen on plain film urography but also can apply to CT urography. 
• Differential for a unilateral absent nephrogram includes renal agenesis, ectopic kidney, surgically absent kidney, or an abnormal kidney that is present but does not enhance. The latter can be caused by acute renal artery/vein occlusion, chronic ureteral obstruction, congenital or acquired renal disease resulting in nonfunctioning nephrons. 
Delayed, prolonged (hyperdense), and persistent nephrograms 
• 
A unilateral delayed nephrogram describes slow renal parenchymal uptake of intravenous contrast compared to the normal contralateral kidney. 

• 
A unilateral prolonged or hyperdense nephrogram refers to diffusely increased density of the kidney relative to the contralateral side, with prolonged parenchymal enhancement and delayed urine excretion. 

• 
The term bilateral persistent nephrogram is used when both kidneys retain intravenous 


contrast material longer than three minutes and there is delayed urine excretion. Causes include systemic hypotension, acute tubular necrosis, bilateral obstructive uropathy, contrast nephropathy, and myeloma kidney. 

Bilateral persistent nephrogram due to obstruction: Unenhanced CT through the kidneys performed several hours after cardiac catheterization shows bilateral left > right persistent nephrogram and densely opacified urine in the proximal collecting system. There is contrast extravasation due to forniceal rupture (red arrow), consistent with distal obstruction. Coronal image from the same study shows the large left-sided pelvic hematoma (yellow arrows) compressing and displacing the bladder. 
• Differential diagnoses for these imaging patterns are listed below. 
Unilateral delayed nephrogram:  Unilateral prolonged (hyperdense) nephrogram:  
Acute ureteral obstruction.  Acute ureteral obstruction.  
Renal artery stenosis.  Renal artery stenosis.  
Renal vein thrombosis/compression.  Renal vein thrombosis/compression.  
Acute pyelonephritis.  

Bilateral persistent nephrogram: 
Systemic hypotension.  Acute urate nephropathy.  
Acute tubular necrosis.  Proteinuria (e.g., myeloma kidney).  
Contrast nephropathy.  Bilateral obstructive uropathy.  

Striated nephrogram 

Axial contrast-enhanced CT shows bilateral striated nephrogram due to pyelonephritis. 
• 
A striated nephrogram describes alternating linear bands of low and high enhancement in a radial pattern through the corticomedullary layers of the kidney following IV contrast administration. 

• 
A striated nephrogram is a nonspecific pattern and can be seen in a number of pathologies: 


Unilateral striated nephrogram: Acute urinary obstruction (unilateral). Acute pyelonephritis. Renal infarct. Renal vein thrombosis or vasculitis. Renal contusion (typically focal). Acute radiation therapy.  Bilateral striated nephrograms: Acute urinary obstruction (bilateral). Acute pyelonephritis. Acute tubular necrosis. Hypotension. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD).  

Extracalyceal contrast material 
• Papillary necrosis, medullary sponge kidney/tubular ectasia, and calyceal diverticulum may 
cause contrast to be seen beyond calyces on excretory phase images. 
• Tubular ectasia causes paintbrush-like streaks of contrast that extend from the papillae into the tubules on excretory urogram. Medullary sponge kidney is tubular ectasia with 
associated calcifications of the renal medullary pyramids. 
• 
Calyceal diverticulum is an outpouching of the collecting system into the corticomedullary region. Dependent sediment or multiple small stones may be present. 

• 
Papillary necrosis, discussed later in this chapter, may also cause extracalyceal contrast. 


Unilateral renal enlargement 
• The differential diagnosis of a unilateral enlarged kidney includes: 
Pyelonephritis. Acute ureteral obstruction. 
Renal vein thrombosis. Compensatory hypertrophy. 



Renal anomalies and normal variants 
Renal anomalies 

Horseshoe kidney. 
Congenital left renal agenesis. Three kidneys (arrows). 
• 
Horseshoe kidney: two kidneys connected anteriorly across midline. 

• 
Crossed fused renal ectopia: two kidneys located on the same side of the body (and at least 


partially fused), with normal insertion of both ureters in the bladder. 
• Unilateral renal agenesis: a single hypertrophied kidney is present. Bilateral renal agenesis 
is not compatible with life. 
• In very rare cases, one or two (accessory) supernumerary kidney(s) can be found. 
Duplicated collecting system: upper and lower moieties are drained by separate ureters. Weigert-Meyer rule: Upper pole ureter has an ectopic insertion on the bladder (usually medial and inferior), often resulting in 
ureterocele and obstruction. (Mnemonic: upper obstructs) Lower pole ureter has a normal insertion on the bladder, often associated with reflux (Mnemonic: lower refluxes). 
Normal variants (renal pseudotumors) 
• Renal pseudotumors are normal variations of renal morphology that may mimic a renal 
mass. 
• 
Hypertrophied column of Bertin: The columns (septa) of Bertin are normal structures that anchor the renal cortex to the hilum, and create the separations between the renal pyramids. When hypertrophied, the columns of Bertin may mimic a renal mass. 

• 
Persistent fetal lobation/lobulation: In normal fetal development, the fetal kidneys are divided into discrete lobes. Occasionally, these lobulations persist into adulthood, producing an indentation of the renal cortex. This indentation can cause an adjacent focal bulge that simulates a renal mass. This pseudomass can usually be distinguished from a true mass by the presence of septa of Bertin on either side. 

• 
Dromedary hump: focal bulge seen at the lateral left kidney, may be secondary to 


compression of the superolateral kidney by the spleen.  

Dromedary hump: Coronal contrast-enhanced CT of a patient 
being evaluated for a right renal interpolar mass found on ultrasound. Imaging reveals 
a left dromedary hump (arrow). 

Nephrocalcinosis, cortical and papillary necrosis 
Medullary nephrocalcinosis 

diff erential of
medullary nephrocalcinosis 
Medullary nephrocalcinosis: Sagittal ultrasound through the right kidney (left image) shows diffusely echogenic renal pyramids (arrows). Coronal CT MIP in bone windows (right image) in a different patient demonstrates symmetric amorphous renal medullary calcification bilaterally.

• 
Medullary nephrocalcinosis represents calcification of the renal medullary pyramids, caused by any disease entity that leads to hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. 

• 
Patients usually have preserved renal function. 

• 
Hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of medullary nephrocalcinosis. 

• 
Sarcoidosis (hypercalcemia). 

• 
Type 1 renal tubular acidosis (distal type). 

• 
Medullary sponge kidney is caused by ectatic tubules in the medullary pyramids that can lead to stasis and stone formation. 

• 
Papillary necrosis. 

• 
In children, treatment with furosemide (Lasix) can lead to medullary nephrocalcinosis. 


Cortical nephrocalcinosis 

Cortical nephrocalcinosis in a child: Abdominal radiograph shows dense cortical calcification of the kidneys (arrows). Ultrasound shows densely calcified and shadowing renal cortex, obscuring the renal parenchyma. 
Case courtesy Michael Hanley, MD, University of Virginia Health System. 
• 
Cortical nephrocalcinosis is dystrophic peripheral calcification of the renal cortex, with sparing of the medullary pyramids. This entity is much less common than medullary nephrocalcinosis and it is usually due to diffuse cortical injury. 

• 
Causes of cortical nephrocalcinosis include: 


Acute cortical necrosis.  Hyperoxaluria.  
Chronic glomerulonephritis.  Alport syndrome (hereditary nephropathy and deafness).  
Chronic transplant rejection.  Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.  

Cortical necrosis 

Cortical necrosis: Contrast-
enhanced axial CT shows lack of enhancement of the renal 
cortices bilaterally (arrows). 
• 
Cortical necrosis is a rare form of renal injury resulting from acute ischemia in setting of small vessel vasospasm or systemic hypotension. Predisposing factors include hemolytic-uremic syndrome and thrombotic microangiopathy. Chronic renal failure develops in up to 50% of patients. 

• 
On CT, there is lack of enhancement of the renal cortex with preservation of medullary enhancement. Cortical necrosis may lead to cortical nephrocalcinosis. 


Papillary necrosis 
• 
Papillary necrosis is necrosis and sloughing of renal papillary tissue, which clinically can cause gross hematuria and may lead to chronic renal insufficiency. 

• 
There are numerous causes of papillary necrosis, most commonly NSAIDs, sickle cell anemia, diabetes, and renal vein thrombosis. The commonly used POSTCARD mnemonic may be 


helpful to remember all causes: 
Pyelonephritis.  Cirrhosis.  
Obstruction.  Analgesics (NSAIDS).  
Sickle cell disease.  Renal vein thrombosis.  
Tuberculosis.  Diabetes mellitus.  

• 
On ultrasound, the kidneys may show focal areas of increased papillary echogenicity. 

• 
On the excretory phase of CT urography, papillary necrosis causes pooling of contrast in the papillary regions adjacent to the calyces. The calyces may appear club-shape or saccular in morphology. Filling defects representing sloughed papilla may be seen in the calyces, renal pelvis, or ureter. 



Papillary necrosis: Coronal 
excretory phase CT urography 
shows bilateral blunted, rounded calyces (arrows). 
• Three classic signs of papillary necrosis include the ball on tee sign, lobster claw sign (not to be confused with the bear paw sign of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis), and signet ring sign, which describe patterns of papillary excavation. 
The ball on tee sign describes contrast filling a central papilla. The lobster claw sign describes contrast filling only the periphery of the papilla. The signet ring sign describes contrast surrounding the sloughed papilla. 

Renal trauma 
Organ Injury Scale (OIS) - American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) 
• The OIS scale from the AAST is the most commonly used system for classifying renal trauma. It was initially a surgical classification, but now encompasses findings from CT imaging, operative report, and pathology. The highest injury among the three is assigned the final AAST grade. The OIS was updated in 2018 to include vascular injuries. 
OIS/AAST grading of renal trauma 
• 
Grade I: by far the most common type of renal injury (95%) and describes a renal contusion or subcapsular hematoma. Treatment is conservative. 

• 
Grade II: superficial laceration (=1 cm) or perinephric hematoma confined to Gerota’s fascia, without urinary extravasation. Treatment is conservative. 

• 
Grade III: deeper laceration (>1 cm), without urinary extravasation; any injury in the presence of renal vascular injury or active bleeding contained within Gerota’s fascia. Treatment is typically conservative. 


A potential pitfall of a grade III injury is that a clot at the collecting system may prevent urinary extravasation initially, but urinary extravasation may occur later as the clot lyses from urinary urokinase. 
• 
Grade IV: deep laceration which extends into the collecting system (causing urinary extravasation), renal pelvis laceration or complete disruption of the ureteropelvic junction, segmental renal artery/vein injury, vascular thrombosis resulting in segmental or complete kidney infarction, or active bleeding beyond Gerota’s fascia. Vascular grade IV injury can be treated with endovascular embolization or stenting. 

• 
Grade V: most severe injury and includes main renal artery/vein laceration or avulsion of the renal hilum, devascularized kidney with active bleeding, or shattered kidney. Treatment 


is variable but typically surgical. 
CT description of renal trauma 
• Renal vascular injury described in the 2018 OIS update is defined as renal artery pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous (AV) fistula. Both appear on imaging as a hyperattenuating focus with density similar to the aorta, that decreases in attenuation on 
delayed phase. 
• 
In contrast, active bleeding appears as focal or diffuse vascular contrast that increases in attenuation and/or size with delayed phase imaging. 

• 
Traumatic renal artery thrombosis occurs with tearing of the intima, initiating thrombosis. There is permanent loss of renal function after approximately two hours of ischemia. 




Page kidney 
• A Page kidney (named after the doctor who performed experiments wrapping animal kidneys with cellophane) is a rare cause of secondary hypertension due to extrinsic compression of the kidney by a subcapsular collection (hematoma/urinoma), usually 
following trauma. 
• A subscapular hematoma compresses the renal parenchyma and decreases its blood flow. Altered hemodynamics induce increased renin secretion, which can lead to hypertension. It 
usually takes several months for hypertension to develop. 
• 
Imaging shows a subcapsular hematoma causing deformation and flattening of the kidney. 

• 
Percutaneous drainage of the hematoma may be effective treatment. 



Hydronephrosis, Urinary Obstruction, and Stones 
Common causes of hydronephrosis 
Obstructive (more common): Obstructing calculus is the most common cause. Ureteral or bladder malignancy. External compression of the ureter by a mass or retroperitoneal fibrosis.  Non-obstructive: Vesicoureteral reflux: congenital or acquired (post-procedural or post-treatment). Pregnancy (usually right > left).  

Stones 
• 
Nephro/ureterolithiasis is a common problem that presents with renal colic. Hematuria is usually present, but may be absent if the stone is completely obstructing. 

• 
Calcium-containing stones (calcium oxalate plus phosphate, pure calcium oxalate, or pure calcium phosphate) represent 73% of urinary stones. 

• 
Urinary stones can also be comprised of uric acid, xanthine, matrix (mucin), pure struvite, and indinavir (seen in HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy). 


Radiographic evaluation of stones 
• 
Calcium-stones are radiopaque. 

• 
Stones comprised of uric acid, xanthine, matrix, pure struvite, or indinavir are radiolucent. 


CT evaluation of stones 
• Most stones are radiopaque on CT, except for indinavir and matrix stones (rare). 

Indinavir stone: Transverse grayscale ultrasound of the bladder shows a 4 mm non-shadowing stone (calipers 
on left image) at the right ureterovesicular junction (UVJ). There is upstream mild right hydroureteronephrosis and urothelial thickening (right image; arrows). No radiopaque stone was seen on CT performed two days prior to this ultrasound (CT not shown). 
CT evaluation of stones (continued) 
• 
Dual-energy CT can be used to differentiate the chemical composition of urinary stones, and in turn, provide useful information for clinical management. 

• 
The soft tissue rim sign helps to distinguish a phlebolith from a ureteral stone. The presence of a small amount of soft tissue surrounding the calcification, thought to represent the edematous ureteral wall, favors a ureteral stone. 

• 
Secondary signs of ureteral obstruction include ipsilateral hydronephrosis and perinephric 


stranding. 

Right obstructive uropathy caused by a distal ureteral stone: Noncontrast axial CT through the kidneys (left image) shows unilateral right hydronephrosis (red arrow). Axial image through the pelvis shows a calcification along the expected course of the right ureter (yellow arrow) demonstrating the soft tissue rim sign, with a faint halo of soft tissue surrounding the calculus. 
Sonographic evaluation of stones and hydronephrosis 
• 
Ultrasound is a fast and inexpensive way to evaluate for nephrolithiasis and hydronephrosis. 

• 
An echogenic shadowing focus in the kidney, ureter or bladder is suspicious for a stone, particularly when associated with twinkling artifact. 

• 
After diagnosing a renal or ureteral calculus, assess for the presence of hydronephrosis and perinephric fluid. 


• Resistive index (RI) may be helpful in diagnosing obstruction. RI can be elevated in acute obstruction. It is calculated with pulse-width Doppler of the renal segmental or arcuate arteries. 
RI = (PSV – EDV)/PSV PSV = peak systolic velocity EDV = end-diastolic velocity 
Higher resistive indices correlate with higher resistance. With no diastolic flow, RI = PSV/PSV = 1 Reversal of diastolic flow technically causes RI >1, although in such cases RI is not measured. 
A RI of >0.7 on the affected side, or a difference of >0.1 between kidneys, suggests acute obstruction. Bilateral elevated RIs (>0.7) are nonspecific and can be due to any number of medical renal processes. RI is not used to diagnose chronic obstruction. 
Sonographic evaluation of stones and hydronephrosis (continued) 
• Ureteral jets may help diagnose hydronephrosis but are controversial. A ureteral jet is flow of urine into the bladder as seen by color Doppler. Flow from the kidney to the bladder would be completely eliminated in complete obstruction, so 
theoretically the presence of a ureteral jet excludes complete obstruction. However, ureteral jets are commonly seen even with stones, and jets are often absent in normal patients. 



Transverse grayscale ultrasound of the bladder (left image) in a different patient from above shows twinkling artifact and posterior shadowing associated with a left UVJ stone (calipers on right image). 
Pitfalls in diagnosing hydronephrosis 
• 
Obstruction without hydronephrosis can occur in cases of very acute obstruction, severe dehydration, or obstruction with ruptured fornix (results in decompression of the renal pelvis and perinephric fluid). 

• 
Outside of non-obstructive causes described above, hydronephrosis without obstruction can be seen in patients with a recently passed stone (or radiolucent stone). 

• 
Hydronephrosis can be difficult to distinguish from renal sinus cysts (peri- and parapelvic cysts). On imaging, renal sinus cysts will show a single or multiple discrete cystic lesions that do not communicate with each other. In true hydronephrosis, the dilated fluid-filled spaces are contiguous. 



Renal infection and inflammation 
Pyelonephritis 

Pyelonephritis: Axial (left image) and coronal (right image) contrast-enhanced CT demonstrates an enlarged left kidney with delayed and striated nephrogram. These imaging features are nonspecific but are compatible with acute pyelonephritis given patient’s clinical symptoms and positive urinalysis. 
• 
Pyelonephritis is infection of renal parenchyma and is the most common bacterial infection of the kidney. Infection typically ascends from the bladder. 

• 
CT imaging findings of pyelonephritis can be nonspecific, and the kidneys can appear normal in up to 75% of cases. Additional imaging patterns include unilateral kidney enlargement, wedge-shaped or striated regions of decreased enhancement, and perinephric stranding. 


The urothelium may also be thickened and hyperenhancing. 
• 
Focal pyelonephritis (previously called focal lobar nephronia) may mimic a renal mass. 

• 
On ultrasound, the classic appearance of focal pyelonephritis is a hypoechoic mass (or masses) with low-amplitude echoes that disrupts the corticomedullary junction. A distinct wall is lacking. Mild hydronephrosis can be seen on the affected side, thought to be due to a bacterial endotoxin causing reduced peristalsis, and should not be confused with obstructive 


uropathy. 
Pyonephrosis 

Pyonephrosis due to malpositioned nephroureteral stent: Initial ultrasound (left image) shows moderate hydronephrosis with a subtle echogenic dependent fluid-debris level (arrows). Low-level echoes are present within the collecting system. The nephroureteral stent is not visualized. 
Subsequent ultrasound less than 12 hours later (right image) shows marked progression of hydronephrosis, a much larger fluid-debris level (arrows), and low level internal echoes within the dilated collecting system. Scanning of the distal ureter (not shown) revealed a malpositioned nephroureteral stent as the cause of obstruction. Case courtesy Julie Ritner, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• Pyonephrosis is the infection of an obstructed collecting system and is colloquially referred to as “pus under pressure.” Treatment is emergent relief of obstruction, either with percutaneous nephrostomy or ureteral stent. 
• Ultrasound shows nonshadowing echogenic material within a dilated collecting system. A fluid-fluid level may be  present. 
Renal abscess 
• 
Renal abscess is a focal necrotic parenchymal infection with a defined wall within the kidney that most commonly results from coalescence of small microabscesses in the setting of acute bacterial pyelonephritis. An abscess may simulate a cystic renal mass. 

• 
Urinalysis may be negative in up to 30% of the time if the infection does not involve the collecting system. 

• 
Ultrasound shows a fluid-filled mass with a distinct thick wall, which may be multiloculated. 

• 
Small abscesses (<3 cm) often undergo a trial of conservative medical therapy, while larger 


abscesses typically undergo percutaneous drainage. 
Emphysematous pyelonephritis 

Emphysematous pyelonephritis: Axial (left image) and coronal CT with oral contrast only shows gas replacing the superior and lateral aspect of the left kidney (yellow arrow). There is gas extending into the left ureter, best seen on the coronal (red arrow). 
• 
Emphysematous pyelonephritis is a complication of acute pyelonephritis characterized by replacement of renal parenchyma by gas. It is caused by gas-forming organisms, most commonly E. coli. Emphysematous pyelonephritis is almost exclusively seen in diabetic or immunocompromised individuals. 

• 
Emphysematous pyelonephritis is a surgical emergency requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics 


and emergent nephrectomy. Mortality can reach 40%. 
• Ultrasound shows high-amplitude echoes in the renal parenchyma representing gas locules with posterior dirty acoustic shadowing. 

Renal tuberculosis 
• 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection of the renal parenchyma results from hematogenous dissemination. Active pulmonary TB is present in approximately 10%. 

• 
Although initial renal TB infection typically involves both kidneys, chronic changes tend to be 


unilateral. 
• 
Imaging findings are characterized by focal cavitary renal lesions with calcification. In addition, scarring, papillary necrosis, and infundibular strictures can be seen. 

• 
End-stage renal TB produces auto nephrectomy and the characteristic putty kidney appearance, which represents an atrophic, calcified kidney. 


Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis 

Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis: Contrast-enhanced CT shows a massively enlarged, poorly enhancing right kidney with dilated and distorted calyces. Several staghorn calculi are present. There is thickening of Zuckerkandl’s and Gerota's fascia, perinephric stranding, and retroperitoneal adenopathy. The partially visualized small bowel in the left hemiabdomen is dilated secondary to ileus from perirenal inflammation. 
Case courtesy Shreya Sood, MD, Brigham and Women's Hospital. 
• 
Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) is a chronic renal infection due to obstructing staghorn calculi, leading to replacement of renal parenchyma with fibrofatty inflammatory tissue. 

• 
Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli are the two most common organisms. 

• 
The clinical presentation of XGP includes flank pain and nonspecific constitutional symptoms, such as fever and weight loss. Anemia and hematuria are also common. 

• 
XGP can be diffuse (85%) or localized. The localized form, also known as “tumefactive XGP,” 


may mimic a renal mass. 
• 
CT is the primary modality for imaging, which demonstrates fatty replacement of the renal parenchyma, marked perinephric inflammatory stranding, and straghorn calculi. The bear paw sign represents the configuration of the hypoattenuating fibrofatty masses arranged in a radial pattern, reminiscent of a bear’s paw. 

• 
Complications include perinephric abscess and fistula formation. Treatment is nephrectomy. 

• 
Primary differential considerations include acute obstructing calculus with pyonephrosis or renal/transitional neoplasm with calcification. 


HIV-associated nephropathy 
• 
HIV virus may directly infect the kidney to produce HIV nephropathy, most commonly resulting in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). HIV nephropathy clinically presents with nephritic renal failure. 

• 
The kidneys are characteristically echogenic. Enlarged echogenic kidneys are specific for HIV nephropathy, although the kidneys are enlarged only about 20% of the time. 




Diagnostic approach to a renal mass 
Ultrasound of a renal mass 
• 
Ultrasound is particularly useful for the initial evaluation of a cystic renal mass. 

• 
Color Doppler should be utilized to evaluate for internal blood flow. Color Doppler is also useful to distinguish a cystic mass from a renal artery aneurysm since they appear similar in 


grayscale. 
CT of a renal mass 
• 
CT is useful for the evaluation of both cystic and solid renal masses. 

• 
A renal mass protocol CT consists of at least three CT phases, each providing different types of information to aid in evaluation. 

• 
Unenhanced phase: quantify baseline attenuation and evaluate for intralesional fat and calcifications. 

• 
Nephrographic phase (100 second delay): evaluate for enhancement by comparing to the 


unenhanced images. 
• Excretory phase (8 minute delay): helpful to show the relationship of a renal mass to the collection system for surgical planning, and to diagnose mimics of cystic renal masses. 
The delayed excretory phase can distinguish between hydronephrosis (will show dense opacification in the pyelographic phase) versus renal sinus cysts (will not opacify). Reflux nephropathy may cause a dilated calyx that can simulate a cystic renal mass on the nephrographic 
phase. The excretory phase would show opacification of the dilated calyx. The excretory phase is also useful to demonstrate a calyceal diverticulum. 
• Although not done routinely, an arterial phase can be performed for presurgical planning. 
MRI of a renal mass 
• 
MRI is particularly useful for the evaluation of solid renal masses. MRI can provide information about internal fat and fluid content, as well as enhancement. Further details are provided in the solid renal mass section. 

• 
MRI plays a limited role in the evaluation of a cystic renal mass. However, given the increased general use of MRI, the new 2019 Bosniak classification formally incorporates MRI into its classification. This is discussed further below. 

• 
Calcifications are harder to detect with MRI. 


Evaluating enhancement of a renal mass (CT and MRI) 
• 
The presence of enhancement is the most important characteristic to diagnose a solid renal mass, but intralesional fat is almost always diagnostic of benign angiomyolipoma. A non­fat-containing renal mass can still be benign, particularly when small (<1 cm), but the risk of malignancy increases with increasing mass size (>3 cm). 

• 
On CT, enhancement is quantified as the absolute increase in Hounsfield units on postcontrast images, compared to pre-contrast: 

• 
On MRI, enhancement is quantified as the percent increase in signal intensity as measured on postcontrast images: 




• Lesions are considered “too small to characterize” if the lesion diameter is smaller than twice the slice thickness. For instance, using 3 mm slices, a lesion less than 6 mm cannot be accurately characterized based on attenuation or enhancement. 
Biopsy of a renal mass 
• After full imaging workup is complete, there are several well-accepted indications for 
percutaneous renal mass biopsy: 
To distinguish renal cell carcinoma from metastasis in a patient with a known primary. To distinguish between renal infection and cystic neoplasm. To definitively diagnose a hyperdense, homogeneously enhancing mass (after MRI has been performed), 
as it may represent a benign angiomyolipoma with minimal fat versus a renal cell carcinoma. 
To definitively diagnose a suspicious renal mass in patient with multiple comorbidities for whom 
nephrectomy would be high risk. 
To definitely diagnose malignancy and subtype in unresectable disease to guide treatment. To ensure correct tissue diagnosis prior to renal mass ablation or stereotactic radiotherapy. To provide definite diagnosis in patients with multiple or bilateral renal masses. To provide definite diagnosis in a renal mass that is in a solitary (or transplant) kidney. To exclude benign neoplasm in small renal masses (<4 cm), as 20% of solid renal masses are benign, and 
proportion increases among smaller masses.  

Cystic renal masses 
Overview of Bosniak classification of cystic renal masses 
• 
The 2019 Bosniak classification for cystic renal masses was updated from 2012 to incorporate MRI, formalize definitions, and reclassify additional masses as lower risk. The Bosniak system risk-stratifies cystic renal masses, with increasing risk for malignancy (RCC) with each subsequent category. Classification is based on morphology, and thus MRI criteria generally mirror those of CT. Calcification plays a limited role in classification. 

• 
MRI frequently upgrades Bosniak criteria due to higher sensitivity for detecting features including septations. MRI can also provide more accuate characterization of enhancement and is most useful to distinguish a Bosniak IIF lesion from a Bosniak III lesion (which can impact management).  MRI is not obscured by calcification which also permits easier lesion evaluation. 

• 
Risk stratification of cystic renal mass based on Bosniak classification: 


Category I and II: <1% risk of malignancy. No follow-up necessary. 
Category IIF: 0-38% risk of malignancy. Imaging follow-up is needed; any morphologic change or new enhancement would be concerning for malignancy. 
Category III: ~50% risk of malignancy but range varies by studies. Concern for malignancy, but may be benign (e.g., infection, multilocular cystic nephroma). Management varies from imaging follow-up to surgical excision (if without comorbidities). 
Category IV: ~90% risk of malignancy. Surgical excision is required unless significant comorbidities. 

Summary of 2019 Bosniak classifi cation of cystic renal masses 
Category I 
Cystic (water-attenuation/intensity) mass with a thin (=2 mm) smooth wall which may enhance. No septa or calcifications. Practically, this classification is never used; this lesion is usually 
called a simple renal cyst. 

Category II 
Six proposed Bosniak subtypes can be distilled to these rules: 
Nonenhancing (excludes thin septa/wall, which may enhance). <4 septa with thickness =2 mm. Proteinaceous/hemorrhagic cysts (nonenhancing, 
homogeneous, hyperattenuating =70 HU or intrinsically T1 hyperintense) =3 cm in size. Homogeneous low-attenuation masses too small to 
characterize. 
Any violation gets upgraded. 

Category IIF 
Cystic mass violating any of the above rules but less than 
Category III falls here. 
Note that Ca++ is no longer included, as this isolated feature has little predictive value. 
Category III 
Any enhancing thick (=4 mm) septation/wall. Any enhancing irregular protrusion with obtuse margins, =3 mm) septation/wall. 
Category IV Any enhancing nodule with acute margins irrespective of size. Any enhancing nodule =4 mm with obtuse margins. 

Differential diagnosis of cystic renal masses 
Simple renal cyst (Bosniak category I) 
• Simple renal cysts are very common, found in approximately 50% of patients over age 
50. A simple renal cyst is an incidental lesion that requires no follow-up, even when 
large. 
• 
A simple renal cyst should have the sonographic hallmarks of a simple cyst, featuring an imperceptible thin wall, anechoic internal contents, and posterior through transmission. 

• 
Harmonic imaging can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of simple renal cyst by eliminating artifactual low-level internal echoes. 

• 
On CT, a simple cyst should attenuate close to 0 HU (and must be < 20 HU), not contain any enhancing components, and have a thin imperceptible wall. 

• 
On MRI, a simple cyst must be hypointense on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and not contain any enhancing component. 


Renal sinus cyst (category I) 
• 
Cysts in the renal sinus may be classified as parapelvic and peripelvic cysts. 

• 
A parapelvic cyst is a renal cortical cyst that herniates into the renal sinus and is usually solitary. These cysts are usually large but solitary. 

• 
Peripelvic cysts are secondary to lymphatic obstruction and are often small and multiple. 

• 
When multiple renal sinus cysts are present (usually peripelvic cysts), the appearance may mimic hydronephrosis. In contrast to hydronephrosis, renal sinus cysts are not contiguous with each other and will not contain excreted contrast on delayed imaging. 


Hyperdense cyst (category II) 
• 
On ultrasound, a hemorrhagic cyst may contain low-level echoes or layers of echoes. 

• 
On noncontrast CT, hemorrhagic cysts are homogeneous and hyperattenuating (>70 HU). The main differential includes a proteinaceous cyst (debris). 

• 
Note that a hyperdense cyst cannot be diagnosed on postcontrast imaging alone because it cannot be distinguished from an enhancing renal mass (unless dual energy CT is used). 



Renal abscess (category II and above) 
• A renal abscess is a contained purulent collection within the kidney. It is described in the renal infection section. 

Neoplasm (category IIF and above) 
• Cystic renal cell carcinoma: Although renal cell carcinoma most commonly presents as 
a solid renal mass, it can also manifest as a complex cystic mass. Worrisome ultrasound findings include thick septa, irregular wall thickening, and a mural nodule. 
• Multilocular cystic nephroma is a benign cystic neoplasm with enhancing septa that occurs in a bimodal age distribution in baby boys and middle-aged women. A characteristic but nonspecific feature is the propensity to herniate into the renal pelvis, 
causing hydronephrosis. 
In adults, multilocular cystic nephroma can be indistinguishable from cystic RCC. In children, multilocular cystic nephroma can be indistinguishable from cystic Wilms tumor. 
• Mixed epithelial and stromal tumor (MEST) is a benign neoplasm composed of 
epithelial and mesenchymal elements, typically found in middle-aged women. MEST may appear as either a solid or cystic mass. 


Multicystic renal disease 
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) 

ADPKD: Axial enhanced CT shows bilateral 
enlarged kidneys with innumerable renal 
cysts of mixed attenuation. The liver is also enlarged and contains innumerable fluid-attenuation cysts. 
• Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) features bilaterally enlarged kidneys with multiple large renal cysts. Patients present with progressive renal failure in their third to fourth decades. The kidneys are sometimes palpable from enlargement and patients may 
display secondary hypertension and hematuria (nephrolithiasis vs. rupture of a renal cyst 
into the collecting system). Approximately 70% of patients have multiple hepatic cysts and 15% of patients have saccular cerebral aneurysms. 
• 
ADPKD is responsible for 10% of patients on long-term dialysis. 

• 
On imaging, the kidneys are markedly enlarged and feature multiple cysts of varying attenuation (or signal intensity on MRI) due to hemorrhage. 

• 
ADPKD is not known to increase the risk of renal cell carcinoma, though some authors propose that there is a slightly increased risk. Renal cell carcinoma associated with ADPKD tends to occur at a younger age and is more often bilateral, multifocal, and sarcomatoid. 


Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) 
• 
Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) features enlarged kidneys with innumerable tiny renal cysts. ARPKD is a diagnosis of infancy and has a poor prognosis. If the child survives infancy, hepatic fibrosis usually develops. 

• 
ARPKD presents in utero as enlarged echogenic kidneys (the cysts are too small to be individually resolved by ultrasound). 


Acquired cystic kidney disease (due to end-stage kidney disease) 
• Patients on long-term dialysis often develop many small renal cysts superimposed upon 
atrophic kidneys. 
• Dialysis-associated cystic renal disease portends an increased risk of renal cell carcinoma (~2–3% prevalence, compared to 1/10,000 prevalence in the general population). 
Localized cystic renal disease 
• This is characterized by benign, slowly progressive proliferation of cysts, typically within a normal functioning kidney and asymptomatic. It is always unilateral, and usually affects only part of the kidney. No imaging follow-up or treatment required. 
Lithium nephropathy 
• Lithium nephropathy is related to long-term lithium use and can present as nephrogenic 
diabetes insipidus or chronic renal insufficiency. 
• The classic imaging appearance is numerous scattered uniform microcysts in bilateral normal-sized kidneys. On ultrasound, these small cysts usually appear as punctate echogenic foci. CT may show calcification within the cysts. MRI is most sensitive and shows tiny nonenhancing fluid intensity cysts in the renal cortex and medulla. 

Sagittal grayscale ultrasound of the left kidney (left image) demonstrates multiple tiny echogenic foci in the renal parenchyma and moderate hydronephrosis. Coronal T2-weighted MRI (right image) shows numerous microcysts in bilateral kidneys, consistent with lithium nephropathy in this patient on long-term lithium therapy. Again seen is left hydronephrosis. 

Solid renal masses – malignant 
• The likelihood of malignancy in a solid renal mass increases with lesion size. Roughly 50% of 
solid renal masses <1 cm are benign, whereas 75% of renal masses >3 cm are malignant. 
• In the presence of a solid renal mass, the renal veins must be carefully evaluated for tumor 
thrombus and extension. 
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) 

Renal cell carcinoma: Sagittal ultrasound through the kidney shows a hypoechoic solid mass (arrows) with heterogeneous echotexture in the interpolar region. The mass demonstrates vascularity on color Doppler (right image).

• 
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common solid renal mass and arises from renal tubular epithelium. It represents 2–3% of all cancers. Risk factors include smoking, acquired cystic kidney disease, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), and tuberous sclerosis. 

• 
RCC has a propensity for venous invasion, which significantly alters surgical approach. 


Renal cell carcinoma (RCC; continued) 
• 
Staging of RCC is based on the Robson system, which characterizes fascial extension and vascular/lymph node involvement. Stages I–III are usually resectable, although the surgical approach may need to be altered for venous invasion (stages IIIA and IIIC). 

• 
On ultrasound, RCC is usually isoechoic to renal cortex, but can be hypo- or hyperechoic. If hyperechoic (mimicking AML), imaging features such as a hypoechoic rim and intratumoral cystic changes favor RCC. Color and spectral Doppler are helpful in differentiating bland renal vein thrombus (which would not be stage IIIA) from tumor thrombus. Tumor thrombus will have color Doppler flow with an arterial waveform. 



Renal cell carcinoma, stage 3A: Coronal (left image) and axial postcontrast fat-suppressed T1-weighted MRI (right image) shows a heterogeneously enhancing mass (yellow arrows) replacing and expanding most of the left kidney. Contiguous to the mass there is expansion and heterogeneous enhancement of the left renal vein (red arrows), representing tumor thrombus and extension of the renal carcinoma into the renal vein. 
• Clear cell RCC is the most common subtype (~75%), with 5-year survival of ~55%. Clear cell RCC tends to enhance more avidly than the less common subtypes. Clear cell can be sporadic or 
associated with Von Hippel-Lindau. 
MRI shows T2 hyperintense signal with marked enhancement. 
• Papillary RCC is a hypovascular subtype, with a 5-year survival of 80–90%. Papillary RCC tends to enhance only mildly due to its hypovascularity. A renal “adenoma” is frequently seen on autopsy specimens and is a papillary carcinoma =5 mm. MRI 
shows T2 hypointensity with mild enhancement. 
• 
Chromophobe is the subtype with the best prognosis, featuring a 90% 5-year survival. 

• 
Sarcomatoid differentiation can occur with subtypes above, resembling sarcoma with an 


aggressive behavior and poor prognosis. 
• The enhancement kinetics can help differentiate the subtypes of RCC.

time 
Renal medullary carcinoma 
• 
Medullary carcinoma is an infiltrative, extremely aggressive neoplasm, with a mean survival of 15 months, not helped by chemotherapy. 

• 
On CT, it is seen as an ill-defined, infiltrative, hypovascular central renal mass. Necrosis and 


hemorrhage are common. 
• Mostly affects young adult males with sickle cell trait. The imaging appearance is similar to renal transitional cell carcinoma, which occurs in an older population. 
Collecting duct carcinoma 
• Collecting duct carcinoma is rare. It shares features with renal medullary carcinoma and also 
has a poor prognosis. 
Renal lymphoma 
• 
Renal lymphoma (most commonly high-grade B-cell) may disseminate hematogenously or spread directly from the retroperitoneum to the kidney. Primary renal lymphoma is very rare and of uncertain origin as there is no native lymphoid tissue within the kidney. 

• 
The most common imaging presentation of renal lymphoma is multiple hypoechoic renal 


masses. Retroperitoneal adenopathy is usually present. A solitary mass is an uncommon 
presentation. Diffuse lymphomatous infiltration producing nephromegaly is relatively  rare. 
• Renal involvement of lymphoma has several patterns of disease: 
Multiple lymphomatous masses (most common pattern; seen in 50% of cases of renal lymphoma). Solitary renal mass. Diffuse lymphomatous infiltration, causing nephromegaly. Direct extension of retroperitoneal disease. 

Two patterns of lymphoma involving the kidneys: 
Axial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (left image) shows hypoenhancing soft tissue mass infiltrating the left kidney and perirenal region, and encasing the renal hilum/vessels (arrows). 
Coronal contrast-enhanced CT (right image) shows multiple masses in bilateral kidneys and the liver, as well as enhancing soft tissue in the perihepatic region, all representing lymphomatous involvement. 

Solid renal masses – benign 
Angiomyolipoma (AML) 

Axial T1-weighted MRI shows that the lesion is predominantly isointense to intra-abdominal fat. 


• 
Angiomyolipoma (AML) is a benign hamartoma made up of blood vessels (angio), smooth muscle (myo), and fat (lipoma). AMLs are the most common benign renal neoplasm. Most occur sporadically (unilateral and solitary), but 40% are associated with tuberous sclerosis (typically multiple and bilateral). 

• 
Although benign, when AMLs are >4 cm in size, there is an increased risk of hemorrhage due 


to microaneurysm rupture within the vascular components of the AML. 
• The presence of macroscopic fat in a non-calcified renal lesion is diagnostic of AML. The nonfat-containing portion enhances avidly and homogeneously. Calcification is rare in AMLs and should raise suspicion for RCC with macroscopic fat. 
• On ultrasound, AML is echogenic due to the fat component. There is considerable overlap 
between the ultrasound appearance of AML and RCC. About one-third of AML demonstrate 
shadowing, which is a specific finding for AML. 
• On MRI, the fat component will follow retroperitoneal fat on all sequences and will saturate out on fat-saturated sequences. The muscle component will be T2 hypointense. Intracytoplasmic lipid is not a feature of AML, so there should be no significant signal drop­out on dual-echo in- and out-of-phase images on MRI. 
• 4% of AMLs lack macroscopic fat and appear as hyperdense enhancing mass on CT. In such cases, MRI can be helpful. A T2 hyperintense mass is suggestive of clear cell RCC or less likely oncocytoma. A T2 hypointense mass may represent a fat-poor AML or papillary RCC, thus biopsy is usually recommended for definitive diagnosis. In rare cases, RCC with macroscopic fat has been described. 
Oncocytoma 

Oncocytoma: Sagittal ultrasound through the right kidney (left image) demonstrates an exophytic solid renal mass (arrows) that is isoechoic to cortex. Color Doppler suggests a spoke-wheel pattern of vascularity. 
Case courtesy Julie Ritner, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Oncocytoma is a benign renal tumor arising from tubular cells. Due to significant imaging overlap with RCC, oncocytomas are usually biopsied or surgically resected. 

• 
On ultrasound, oncocytoma is indistinguishable from RCC. It has variable echogenicity. A spoke-wheel vascular pattern is sometimes seen on color Doppler. 

• 
On CT/MRI, certain features can suggest oncocytoma, but cannot reliably differentiate it from RCC. Features suggestive of oncocytoma include homogeneous enhancement and a central scar. The segmental enhancement inversion sign can be a more specific feature, referring to a “flip-flop” of enhancement of the tumor and central scar on early and late 



Oncocytoma: Noncontrast CT (left image) shows an isodense renal mass (yellow arrows) containing a central punctate focus of hyperattenuation (red arrow). The contrast-enhanced excretory phase CT (right image) demonstrates that the mass enhances. There is a faint suggestion of a central focus of non-enhancement (red arrows), corresponding to a central scar. 
• Diagnosis can be confirmed with percutaneous biopsy. Of note, oncocytic cells can be found in the rare chromophobe RCC subtype. However, pathologists can usually distinguish 
oncocytoma from the more common clear cell and papillary RCC subtypes. 
Non-neoplastic solid renal masses 
• When evaluating a potential renal mass, it’s critical to exclude non-neoplastic etiologies with 
mass-like appearance. 
• 
Infection, especially focal pyelonephritis, can mimic a solid renal mass. Renal abscess may be difficult to differentiate on imaging from a cystic renal cell carcinoma. Follow-up imaging is usually performed to confirm resolution following treatment with antibiotics. 

• 
Renal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) will avidly enhance and can mimic a hypervascular renal mass. One clue to the presence of an AVM would be asymmetric enhancement of the renal vein on the affected side, due to early shunting of venous blood. 



Syndromes with renal masses (all have increased ris. of RCC) 
von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) 
• 
von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is an autosomal dominant multi-organ syndrome caused by a mutation in the VHL tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 3, which leads to cysts and neoplasms in multiple organs. 

• 
The primary manifestation of VHL in the genitourinary system is multiple bilateral renal cell carcinomas, most commonly the clear cell subtype. 

• 
Other genitourinary manifestations of VHL include multifocal pheochromocytoma and renal 


cysts. 
• 
Central nervous system manifestations of VHL include hemangioblastoma of the brainstem, cerebellum, or spinal cord. 

• 
Pancreatic and hepatic manifestations include malignant neuroendocrine pancreatic tumor, pancreatic serous cystadenoma (a benign neoplasm), and pancreatic/hepatic cysts. 


Birt-Hogg-Dubé 
• Birt-Hogg-Dubé is an autosomal dominant syndrome (mutation of BHD gene on chromosome 17p) of dermatologic lesions, cystic lung disease, and multiple renal oncocytomas, renal cell carcinomas (chromophobe subtype), and hybrid chromophobe RCC­
oncocytoma tumors. 
Tuberous sclerosis (TS) 

Axial contrast-enhanced CT shows 
multiple bilateral fat-containing renal masses, compatible with AMLs in this patient with known tuberous 
sclerosis. 
• 
Tuberous sclerosis (TS) is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disease caused by a tumor suppressor gene mutation. It manifests clinically with seizures, developmental delay, and (mostly) benign tumors in multiple organ systems. 

• 
The most common renal manifestation of TS is multiple bilateral renal angiomyolipomas (AMLs). Approximately 50% of patients with TS will have at least one AML. 

• 
Renal cysts can be seen in ~25%. 

• 
The relative risk of renal cell carcinoma is increased in patients with TS, which occurs in approximately 2–3% of patients. Diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma is complicated by the abnormal kidneys that may have multiple cysts and/or AMLs. 

• 
In the heart, the most common neoplasm is a rhabdomyoma. A cardiac rhabdomyoma may 


be present during fetal life and can be detected by fetal ultrasound. 
• In the lung, a process of smooth muscle proliferation identical to lymphangioleiomyomatosis can occur, causing cystic replacement of lung parenchyma. It has been suggested that the abnormal smooth muscle in the lung in patients with TS represents genetically identical metastatic smooth muscle from a renal angiomyolipoma. 
Hereditary papillary RCC (HPRCC) 
• HPRCC is an autosomal dominant syndrome that presents with multiple, bilateral papillary RCCs. It is associated with mutations in the MET gene. 
Hereditary leiomyomatosis and RCC (HLRCC) 
• HLRCC is an autosomal hereditary syndrome characterized by the development of multiple RCCs, uterine and cutaneous leiomyomas, and adrenal hyperplasia. The most commonly 
seen renal cancer subtype is papillary RCC. 
Sickle cell trait 
• Sickle cell is associated with medullary renal carcinoma. 
Comparison of syndromes with renal masses

Imaging of Renal Transplant 
Approach to renal transplant 
• The transplanted kidney is implanted in the right > left iliac fossa. It is easily evaluated by ultrasound due to its superficial location. Usually, a single kidney is transplanted, but 
en-bloc transplant of both kidneys into the recipient can be occasionally performed 
(i.e., pediatric donor kidneys to an adult recipient). 
• 
The goal of ultrasound evaluation after renal transplant is to determine whether there is a treatable surgical or vascular complication. Ultrasound cannot reliably differentiate between the various causes of parenchymal rejection, but it is useful to guide percutaneous biopsy for definite diagnosis. 

• 
An elevated RI (>0.7) suggests renal dysfunction, but this finding is nonspecific. 


Surgical complications following renal transplant 

Coronal contrast-enhanced CT shows 
a transplant kidney in the left lower quadrant (yellow arrow) and native bilateral polycystic kidneys. There is a loculated fluid collection inferior 
to the transplant kidney which 
tracks into a left inguinal hernia (red arrows). Differential for this collection includes a seroma, urinoma, or 
lymphocele. 
Surgical complications following renal transplant (continued) 
• 
Ureteral obstruction is apparent on ultrasound as hydronephrosis. 

• 
Fluid collection (blood, pus, urine) is highly dependent on timing: 


Immediately postoperative: Hematoma. 3–4 weeks postoperative: Abscess. 1–2 weeks postoperative: Urinoma. 2nd month and beyond: Lymphocele. 
Vascular complications following renal transplant 
• 
Renal vein thrombosis: The renal artery Doppler may show reversal of diastolic flow. 

• 
Renal artery stenosis: Elevated flow velocities are seen at the site of stenosis, with a parvus et tardus waveform distal to the stenosis. Usually takes several weeks to months to develop. 

• 
Pseudoaneurysm is usually due to renal biopsy. 


Medical complications following renal transplant 
• 
Medical complications generally cannot be differentiated on ultrasound. Biopsy is necessary for diagnosis, although the time elapsed since the transplant may be a helpful clue. 

• 
Hyperacute rejection: Occurs in first few hours after transplant. Hyperacute rejection is very rare, and is due to ABO blood type incompatibility. 

• 
Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): Occurs in the immediate few postoperative days. ATN is usually a sequela of pre-implantation ischemia. 

• 
Acute rejection: Occurs within three months of transplant. 

• 
Chronic rejection: Occurs after three months of transplant. 

• 
Drug toxicity may be caused by cyclosporine, which is nephrotoxic. 


Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) 
• 
Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a type of lymphoma that is thought to be due to immune suppression and Epstein-Barr virus proliferation. 

• 
PTLD can arise anywhere in the body. Any new mass in any organ in a transplant patient should raise concern for potential PTLD. 

• 
Ultrasound of renal PTLD will show an amorphous hypoechoic mass which may simulate a fluid collection on grayscale images. Unlike fluid, PTLD will demonstrate Doppler flow.
