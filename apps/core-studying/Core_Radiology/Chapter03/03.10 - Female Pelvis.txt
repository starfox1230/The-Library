Female pelvis 
anatomy 
True and false pelvis 
• 
The linea terminalis is a bony landmark separating the true (inferior) pelvis from the false (superior) pelvis. The linea terminalis is a composite of the arcuate line of the ilium, the iliopectineal line, and the pubic crest. 

• 
Normally, the uterus and ovaries are in the true pelvis. 

• 
The dome of a full bladder extends into the false pelvis, pushing small bowel out of the true 


pelvis. The bladder acts as a sonographic window into the true pelvis.

Space of Retzius 
• The space of Retzius is an extraperitoneal potential space between the pubic symphysis and 
the bladder. 
• 
A mass in the space of Retzius (such as a hematoma) can displace the bladder posteriorly. 

• 
In contrast, pelvic or abdominal masses will displace the bladder inferiorly or anteriorly. 


Uterovesicular space 
• 
Intraperitoneal space created by double folding of peritoneum between the anterior surface of the uterus and the bladder. 

• 
Inferior to this space, the cervix is attached to the posterior edge of the bladder by the 


parametrium. 
Rectouterine pouch (of Douglas) 
• 
Intraperitoneal space created by double folding of peritoneum between the posterior surface of the uterus and the rectum. 

• 
Also known as the cul de sac, this is the most dependent portion of the peritoneal cavity.

Imaging the pelvis 
Ultrasound of the female pelvis 
• Both transabdominal and transvaginal imaging can be used for pelvic evaluation. In general, transvaginal ultrasound provides better resolution due to closer proximity to the internal 
organs. 
• 
Transabdominal and transvaginal imaging is usually performed sequentially. Transabdominal imaging is conducted first because it is less invasive and can sometimes provide more comprehensive and sufficient diagnostic information. Transabdominal imaging requires a full bladder to provide an acoustic window for visualization of deep pelvic structures. Prior to transvaginal ultrasound, the bladder should be emptied to minimize discomfort and improve visualization. 

• 
The sagittal scan plane is rotated 90 degrees between transabdominal and endovaginal orientation. The patient typically empties her bladder prior to endovaginal scanning. 




MRI of the female pelvis 
• 
MRI provides the greatest anatomic detail in pelvic imaging and is used for diagnostic evaluation in challenging or indeterminate cases on the previously mentioned modalities. 

• 
MRI can also permit evaluation of adjacent structures and assessment for pelvic 


lymphadenopathy. 
CT of the female pelvis 
• CT has overall low sensitivity in the evaluation of pelvic disorders, but can be used in staging of pelvic tumors to assess for metastatic disease.

Hysterosalpingogram 
• Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) is commonly used during evaluation of infertility. Pregnancy 
should be excluded prior to the exam. 
• 
Using a speculum, a catheter is placed into the uterine cervix. Contrast is injected under fluoroscopy into the uterine cavity to evaluate uterine contour (early filling) and fallopian tubes (late filling). 

• 
The uterus can be evaluated for congenital anomalies and acquired filling defects (e.g., polyps or endometrial cancer). 


• Contrast should enter the fallopian tubes and spill freely into the peritoneum. If free spill is not seen from a fallopian tube, it is likely occluded. If occlusion is caused by tubal spasm, slow continued injection will subsequently opacify the tube.

• Sometimes, contrast is seen spilling into the peritoneum, but remains localized (loculated). Loculated peritoneal contrast is suggestive of pelvic adhesions, which can be seen in pelvic inflammatory disorder.
