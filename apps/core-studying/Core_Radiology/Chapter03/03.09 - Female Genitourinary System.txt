Female genitourinary system 
Female urethra 
Anatomy 
• The female urethra is much shorter than the male urethra. Unlike the male urethra, the 
female urethra is not divided into discrete segments. The proximal third of the urethra 
is lined by transitional epithelium, while the distal portion of the urethra is lined with a stratified squamous epithelium. 

Urethral diverticulum 
• 
Urethral diverticulum presents clinically with post-void dribbling, urethral pain, and dyspareunia. Often, however, the symptoms may be vague and nonspecific. 

• 
Diverticula are thought to arise from glandular dilation caused by inflammation and chronic infection of the paraurethral glands of Skene. 







• On imaging, urethral diverticulum appears as a periurethral cystic lesion that typically arises from the posterolateral urethra and wraps around the urethra circumferentially with a 
classic saddlebag or U-shaped morphology. 

• 
Urethral diverticula are prone to develop calculi due to urinary stasis. 

• 
Very rarely, adenocarcinoma may develop within a urethral diverticulum. 



Anatomy 
• 
The vagina is a 8–10 cm fibromuscular organ consisting of the vaginal orifice, vault, and the anterior, posterior, and lateral fornices. 

• 
The posterior fornix is covered by the peritoneum of the rectouterine pouch (Pouch of Douglas). 

• 
The vagina is supported by the levator ani, transverse cervical ligament, pubocervical ligament, uterosacral ligament, and perineal body. 

• 
The paraurethral glands of Skene are paired anterior glands on either side of the urethral opening. They are homologous to the male prostate and secrete mucus at the external meatus. 

• 
The Bartholin glands are posterior paired pea-sized structures on either side of the vaginal 


opening as part of the vulva. They are analogous to the bulbourethral (Cowper) glands in the male and secrete lubricating fluid. 
• 
Arterial supply: vagina, uterine, internal pudendal and middle rectal arteries (internal iliac artery branches). 

• 
Venous drainage: into internal iliac veins. 


• Lymphatic drainage is divided in thirds. The upper third drains to the external iliac nodes. The middle third drains to the internal iliac and sacral nodes. 
The lower third drains to superficial inguinal and perirectal nodes. 
Imaging of the vagina 
• MRI imaging is the modality of choice for imaging of the distal urethra and distal vagina at 
the introitus. Self-administered intra-vaginal ultrasound gel may improve visualization on 
MRI but is not always used. 



Benign vaginal lesions 
Retention cysts of the vagina 

• Periurethral cysts is a general category of cystic lesions around the urethra and vagina. They are usually asymptomatic, often seen incidentally on MRI. These secretory retention cysts can become large or infected and cause pain. Location is the key to differentiation, as summarized in the illustration above and the details on the following page. 
Skene duct cysts (paraurethral duct cyst): Retention cysts due to obstruction or inflammation of the paraurethral ducts. They are typically located anterior, near midline and below the level of pubic symphysis. MRI shows T2 hyperintense signal if uncomplicated, but hemorrhage may cause fluid-fluid 
levels. 

Gartner duct cysts: Retention cysts arising from the embryologic remnants of the mesonephric (Wolffian) duct. They are found in the anterolateral vaginal wall, above the level of pubic symphysis. MRI and US often detect Gartner duct cysts incidentally. 
Bartholin gland cysts: Retention cysts due to obstruction of the Bartholin duct by prior infection or trauma resulting in stenosis, stone, or thick mucus and retained secretions. They are found in the inferior third of the vagina at the posterolateral vaginal wall, below the level of pubic symphysis and associated with the labia majora. Superinfection of the cysts may occur. MRI signal characteristics depend on protein content of the cyst resulting in variable T1 and heterogeneous T2 signal. 
Nabothian cysts are located at the cervix and are due to occlusion of cervical glands.

Axial and sagittal T2-weighted MRI images show a paraurethral (Skene) duct cyst (yellow arrows) located at the left lateral aspect of the urethral meatus and inferior to the pubic symphysis (red arrow). 
Fistulas involving the vagina 
• 
Anovaginal fistula can arise from Crohn’s disease, obstetric trauma, pelvic floor surgery, and radiation therapy. Gas and feces passed through the vagina can cause recurrent vaginal infections. 

• 
Urethrovaginal fistula can occur after excision for urethral diverticulum, resulting in urinary incontinence. 

• 
Vesicovaginal fistula represents a significant morbidity in female urology and occurs most commonly in the setting of obstructed childbirth or after urologic or pelvic surgery. 

• 
On MRI imaging, sagittal plane is the most reliable plane for visualization of fistulas. 

• 
Real-time fluoroscopic evaluation can be useful tools to characterize fistulas. Depending on location and organs involved, contrast can be injected into the relevant space to assess for abnormal extravasation.

ureteral stents; the right ureteral stents traverse the 
vesicovaginal fistula (green arrows). A foley catheter is 
present in the bladder.

Vaginal cancer 
• Squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina accounts for 80–85% of primary vaginal 
malignancies and usually presents in older women. It is associated with HPV similar to SCC 
of the cervix. 

• Adenocarcinoma of the vagina presents in younger women (15% of vaginal malignancies) 
and can arise from vaginal adenosis. 

• 
Clear cell carcinoma of the vagina is rare and associated with previous diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure. These patients will often have a “T-shaped” uterus, described later in the uterine malformations section. 

• 
Primary vaginal melanoma is rare and most commonly presents in postmenopausal women. It has an aggressive course. 

• 
Vaginal sarcoma presents as rhabomyosarcoma in the pediatric population. This is the most common vaginal tumor in children. It has a bimodal distribution, usually ages 2–6 and 


14–18. 


Vulvar cancer 
• Vulvar cancer commonly involves the labia majora and minora, accounting for up to 5% of 
female genital tract malignancies with peak age 65–70 years old. 

Metastasis 
• 
Metastasis to the vagina can occur from the upper genital tract or the GI tract. 

• 
Metastasis located in the upper 1/3 of the vagina (typically anterior) is usually from the upper genital tract. Metastasis located in the lower 1/3 (typically posterior) is usually from 


the GI tract.
