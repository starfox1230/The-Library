Anatomy and physiology 

• There is a dual blood supply to the ovary: 
The ovarian artery comes directly off the aorta to supply the lateral aspect of the ovary. 
A branch of the uterine artery arises from the internal iliac artery to supply the medial aspect of the ovary. 
• The fallopian tube is divided into four segments, from proximal to distal: Interstitial (intramural) is the narrowest segment. 
Isthmus. Ampulla. Infundibulum. 
Cyclical changes in the ovaries 
• 
Day 5–7 of the menstrual cycle: Multiple Graafian follicles become apparent in the ovary (these are <3 cm in diameter). 

• 
Day 8–13: One (or more) dominant follicles arise. 

• 
Day 14: Ovulation. Physiologic bleeding occurs into the follicle at the time of ovulation, at which point the follicle is called the corpus hemorrhagicum. After ovulation, the corpus 


hemorrhagicum becomes the corpus luteum. 
• Day 15–20: The corpus luteum retains fluid over the next 4–5 days to reach a maximal size 
of approximately 3 cm. 
• 
Day 20–28. If pregnancy doesn’t occur, the corpus luteum involutes to become the corpus albicans, which cannot be seen by ultrasound. 

• 
If pregnancy occurs, the corpus luteum develops into a gland secreting ß-hCG. A prominent 


corpus luteum may be mistaken for an ectopic pregnancy due to its similar appearance. However, an ectopic pregnancy will only very rarely be in the ovary. 

Adnexal torsion 
• Adnexal torsion results from twisti ng of the 
ovarian vascular pedicle. This results in pain and 
potenti al vascular compromise to the ovary. 
• Acute pain is usually localized to the aff ected side. Pain may be episodic, especially if the torsion is intermitt ent. Torsion occurs mainly in reproducti ve-age women, and commonly occurs 
in pregnancy. Torsion occurs more commonly on 
the right side due to the positi on of the sigmoid 
Diagram demonstrates dual blood supply of the colon, which inhibits free rotati on of the left  ovary, with the yellow curved arrow representi ng 
adnexa. Torsion may clinically mimic appendiciti s. adnexal torsion. 
• The ovary may be predisposed to torsion by a lead-point adnexal mass, parti cularly if large, 
most commonly an ovarian dermoid. 
• 
Because of the dual blood supply to the ovary (lateral from the ovarian vessels off  the aorta, and medial from the uterine vessels from the internal iliac), fl ow may sti ll be detectable by color Doppler, even with torsion. Intermitt ent ovarian torsion and detorsion may also explain detectable color Doppler fl ow in these cases. 

• 
Classic ultrasound features of ovarian torsion in a pati ent with acute pelvic pain includes an enlarged, edematous ovary with abnormal Doppler, and free fl uid. Twisti ng (“swirling”) of the vascular pedicle (whirlpool sign) is very specifi c, but not oft en seen. Less specifi c but most common features include: 


Enlarged ovary >4 cm in diameter. 
Unusual positi on of aff ected ovary, which may be even found on the contralateral side. 
Follicles pushed to the periphery of the ovary. 
Free fl uid in the pelvis. 
Variable Doppler fi ndings: Lack of fl ow is not always seen and usually indicates necrosis or infarcti on. 
Other Doppler fi ndings include normal or intermitt ent fl ow, absent or reversed arterial diastolic fl ow on 
spectral imaging. 
• MRI and CT features of ovarian torsion are similar to the ultrasound fi ndings. The most common (but nonspecifi c) fi nding is an enlarged ovary > 4 cm in diameter. The follicles may be peripherally displaced due to central hemorrhage and edema. Twisti ng of the ovarian pedicle is uncommonly seen, but is pathognomonic for torsion when identi fi ed. 
Ovarian torsion: 
Axial T2-weighted MRI demonstrates an enlarged right ovary that is displaced 
into the pouch of Douglas. Note the edematous central stroma (yellow arrow) 
and peripherally distributed small follicles 
(red arrows). The heterogeneously T2 
hyperintense lesion within the right ovary 
may have been the lead-point. Note the parti ally imaged, normalized left  ovary (blue arrow). 



Functional ovarian cysts 
Overview of functional ovarian cysts 
• 
Functional cysts include follicular cysts, corpus luteal cysts, and theca lutein cysts. 

• 
A follicular cyst (usually called a simple cyst), results from failed ovulation of the dominant follicle(s). The dominant follicle continues to grow in size and is considered a follicular cyst 


when >3 cm. 
A simple ovarian cyst is a round or oval anechoic structure with smooth and imperceptibly thin walls, posterior acoustic enhancement, and lack of worrisome features such as solid components, septations, or internal flow on color Doppler. 
• A corpus luteal cyst results from failed involution of the corpus luteum. Like the follicular cyst, it can continue to grow in size and must be >3 cm for diagnosis. 
A corpus luteal cyst can have variable appearances, but will often look like a complex ovarian cyst. High diastolic flow is often present, which can also be seen in ovarian cancer. 
• 
Theca lutein cysts are often multiple and arise from elevated hCG. They can be seen in molar pregnancy, multiple gestations, or infertility patients on gonadotropins or clomiphene. 

• 
A hemorrhagic cyst is most often the result of hemorrhage into a functional cyst, most commonly a corpus luteum. Ultrasound findings can be suggestive, although a complex cyst should be followed-up at least once to ensure resolution. 


An acutely hemorrhagic cyst may be hyperechoic and potentially mimic a solid mass, but will usually show posterior enhancement. As the clot dissolves, the internal echo pattern becomes more complex to produce characteristic web-like internal echoes. Retractile mural clot features concave margins and absent Doppler flow. In contrast, a solid mural nodule features a convex margin and internal flow 

Hemorrhagic cyst: Transvaginal color Doppler of an ovary 
shows a large complex ovarian cyst 
containing web-like internal echoes, with no flow on color Doppler. Follow­up ultrasound confirmed resolution of 
the mass. 
• The Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound (SRU) published a consensus in 2010 regarding management of asymptomatic ovarian and adnexal cysts imaged at ultrasound, which was 
updated in 2019. 
• Simple cysts do not confer any increased risk of ovarian cancer, presuming the cyst can be 
completely visualized and reliably characterized. 
• 
Simple ovarian cysts should be followed if >7 cm in premenopausal women, or >5 cm in postmenopausal women per updated 2019 SRU consensus criteria. 

• 
On follow-up exams, regardless of menopausal status: 


A cyst stable in size for two years can be considered benign and no further imaging follow-up needed. 
A cyst that decreases in size on follow-up (by >10–15%) in average linear dimension can be considered 
benign and no further follow-up needed. 

Physiologic simple cyst (in a premenopausal patient) 
• Cysts =3 cm do not need to be described in the report, and there is no need for follow-up. 
SRU consensus 
(premenopausal)
• Cysts >3 and =5 cm should be mentioned in the report and described as benign, with no 
follow-up necessary. 
• Cysts >5 cm should be described. If superior visualization and confidence AND =7 cm, no follow-up is needed. If standard visualization or confidence OR >7 cm, follow-up should be performed in 2–6 or 6–12 months. 2–6 months: Early follow-up if proper characterization desired. 6–12 months: To assess growth. 

Postmenopausal simple ovarian cyst 
• Cysts =1 cm are considered normal and do not need to be reported or followed. 
SRU consensus 
(postmenopausal) 
• Cysts >1 cm and =3 cm are almost certainly benign, but should be described to document. No follow-up is needed. 
• Cysts >3 cm should be described. If superior visualization and confidence AND =5 cm, no follow-up is needed. If standard visualization or confidence OR >5 cm, follow-up should be performed in 3–6 or 6–12 months. 3–6 months: Early follow-up if proper characterization desired. 6–12 months: To assess growth. 

Hemorrhagic cyst 
• In both pre- and post-menopausal women, hemorrhagic cysts >5 cm should undergo short-term follow-up US (6–12 weeks) to ensure resolution. If it does not resolve, the diagnosis of 
endometrioma is considered. 
Cyst with indeterminate, but probably benign, characteristics 
• 
These include cysts with features that are suggestive, but not sufficient to allow a confident diagnosis of hemorrhagic cyst, endometrioma, or dermoid. 

• 
In women of reproductive age or women in early menopause, follow-up US within 6–12 weeks is suggested for resolution of a lesion to confirm that it is a hemorrhagic cyst. If unchanged, then continued follow-up is to be considered. If follow-up imaging does not confirm an endometrioma or dermoid, surgical evaluation is recommended.  

• 
In post-menopausal women, surgical evaluation is considered. 

• 
Endometriomas, also referred to as endometriotic cysts, represent ectopic endometrial tissue implanted on the adnexa. As endometrial tissue is hormonally responsive, an endometrioma may be composed of blood products of varying ages (chocolate cyst). 

• 
They can be solitary but bilateral ovarian involvement is common (30–50%) and increases specificity for the diagnosis of endometriosis. 

• 
Endometriomas can rupture as a result of rapid growth, particularly during pregnancy, which can lead to acute pelvic pain and hemoperitoneum. They can lead to adhesions, tethering of bowel loops, and obliteration of the fat planes. Another rare complication is malignant degeneration into endometrioid or less commonly clear cell subtypes of ovarian cancer. 

• 
On ultrasound, an endometrioma may represent as a well-defined complex cyst with homogeneous low-level internal echoes and posterior acoustic enhancement. Occasionally 


an endometrioma may appear similar to a neoplasm. 

Endometrioma on ultrasound: 
Coronal grayscale ultrasound demonstrates a right ovarian mass with uniform low-
level internal echoes, posterior acoustic enhancement (arrows), and no internal flow on color Doppler. 
• MRI typically shows multiple T1 hyperintense masses (due to hemorrhagic content) which demonstrate signal gradient (“shading”) on T2-weighted images. Endometriomas - unlike dermoids - do not suppress on fat-saturated sequences. Less commonly, endometriosis may 
appear hyperintense on both T1- and T2-weighted images. Tiny hemorrhagic endometrial implants may be apparent as hyperintense foci on T1-weighted images. 
• Laparoscopy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of suspected endometriosis, with implants appearing as small areas of tissue distortion with hemorrhagic spots or large 
masses with associated adhesions.

• 
Ovarian neoplasms include a large group of benign and malignant tumors that can be classified based on where they originate in the ovary. 80% of ovarian masses are benign. 

• 
The three histologic types of primary ovarian neoplasm include epithelial neoplasm, germ cell tumor, and sex cord-stromal tumor. 

• 
Surface epithelial tumors account for 70% of ovarian neoplasms overall and >90% of ovarian cancers. 

• 
Germ cell tumors include mature cystic teratomas (dermoid) and dysgerminomas. Struma ovarii is a subtype of teratoma that is composed of mature, functioning thyroid tissue. 

• 
Sex cord-stromal tumors include fibroma, thecoma, and fibrothecoma. Meigs syndrome is the triad of benign ovarian fibroma, ascites, and right pleural effusion. 


Tumors containing thecal cells produce estrogen and may cause endometrial carcinoma. 
• The Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) provides risk stratification for ovarian and adnexal lesions on ultrasound and MRI. It divides lesions into five categories from normal ovary (1) to high risk (>50% chance of malignancy based on ultrasound, or ~90% risk of malignancy based on MRI). 
Dermoid cyst (mature cystic teratoma) 

Dermoid cyst: Grayscale ultrasound image of the right ovary (left image) shows a complex ovarian cyst with a densely echogenic, shadowing focus centrally representing the Rokitansky nodule (arrow). Color Doppler shows the dot-dash sign, echogenic shadowing, and no significant internal Doppler flow. 
• 
Dermoid cyst, also called a mature cystic teratoma, is the most common ovarian neoplasm. Technically, a teratoma contains all three primitive germ cell layers, while a dermoid cyst may contain only two. In general use, however, these terms are interchangeable. 

• 
Malignant transformation is very rare and typically occurs in postmenopausal patients. Another rare complication is intraperitoneal rupture leading to acute peritonitis. 

• 
A dermoid cyst can act as a lead point for adnexal torsion particularly when large (>4 cm). 


• The classic ultrasound appearance of a dermoid cyst is a complex ovarian cyst with an echogenic Rokitansky nodule, which is a solid nodule projecting into the cyst cavity, from which hair or teeth may arise. The imaging appearance can be variable, however, and other common imaging features include: The dot-dash pattern describes interrupted echogenic lines thought to be produced by keratin fibers. The tip of the iceberg sign describes obscuration of the deeper contents due to high-attenuation material. 
• CT and MRI typically show a heterogeneous unilocular cystic structure with coarse calcification, corresponding to sebaceous material, hair follicles, and fat. A Rokitansky nodule may or may not be seen. Less commonly, a dermoid cyst may appear as a solid hyperdense or fat-density mass. 


Dermoid cyst (mature cystic teratoma; continued) 
• Both endometriomas and teratomas are predominantly hyperintense on T1-weighted images due to their blood and fat content, respectively. Distinction can be made by using the fat-suppressed imaging sequences. Teratoma will show signal loss on the fat-suppressed images, due to internal macroscopic fat, while an endometrioma will not. 

Dermoid causing ovarian torsion: 
Axial contrast-enhanced CT demonstrates 
abnormal location of the right ovary which is displaced to the left adnexa. The lead-point is a right ovarian mass (arrows) containing fat, soft tissue, and calcification. 

Ovarian cancer 
• 
Ovarian cancer is the tenth most common female malignancy, but ranks fifth in cancer deaths among women as it often presents at a late stage. 

• 
Ovarian cancer may be epithelial, germ cell, sex cord-stromal, or metastatic in origin. 

• 
Approximately 90% of malignant tumors are of epithelial origin. Serous tumors are the most common epithelial subtype, followed by mucinous, endometrioid, and clear cell. 


Serous cystadenocarcinomas are frequently bilateral and typically appear as mixed solid and cystic masses. The solid portions demonstrate avid enhancement. There is often concomitant ascites. Mucinous cystadenocarcinomas are large, most commonly unilateral, and occur in older patients 
compared to serous cystadenocarcinomas. Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma typically presents as a 
multiloculated cystic mass containing mucin-rich T1 hyperintense fluid. 
Clear cell carcinoma and less commonly endometrioid carcinoma are associated with endometriosis. 
• 
Malignant germ cell tumors occur in younger patients and include dysgerminoma, endodermal sinus tumor, and immature teratoma. 

• 
Metastases to the ovary are uncommon but may result from gastric cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma. Metastases are often bilateral. 


A Krukenberg tumor is an ovarian metastasis of a mucin-producing tumor, typically gastric or colonic adenocarcinoma. 
Endometrial cancer may also metastasize to the ovaries. 
• 
Ultrasound findings suggestive of a malignant ovarian mass include: 

• 
MRI is used to characterize indeterminate adnexal masses, rather than for staging. 

• 
Features suggesting malignancy include a large size (>10 cm), solid enhancing component(s), internal necrosis, ascites, or peritoneal nodularity, although no finding is 100% specific. 

• 
Staging of ovarian carcinoma is based on the FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) system. It characterizes extent of disease based on involvement of the ovaries (one or two), fallopian tubes, uterus, pelvic intraperitoneal tissues, retroperitoneal lymph nodes, malignant cells in peritoneal washings, and/or peritoneal or distant 


Mural nodule.  High .ow on color Doppler.  
Thick or irregular walls or septae.  Presence of ascites.  
Solid components.  Papillary projections.  

metastasis. 

Ovarian cancer (continued) 
• MRI is highly sensitive to detect peritoneal implants, which occur most commonly in the

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: Sagittal grayscale ultrasound of the right upper quadrant (left image) shows a large amount of ascites (arrow). Right lower quadrant ultrasound (right image) shows a markedly enlarged ovary (calipers measure greater than 8 cm), with numerous enlarged follicles. The patient was receiving infertility treatment. 
• 
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a complication of infertility treatment, thought to be due to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) dysregulation causing capillary leak. 

• 
The criteria for diagnosis of OHSS include abdominal pain, bilateral and symmetric spoke-wheel enlargement of the ovaries (>5 cm), and presence of either ascites or hydrothorax. At least one additional laboratory or clinical symptom must be met, including elevated hematocrit (=45%), elevated WBC (>15,000), elevated LFTs, acute renal failure, or dyspnea. 

• 
OHSS increases the risk of ovarian torsion and ectopic pregnancy, and it can lead to coagulopathy, hypovolemia, and shock. 



Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) 

PCOS: Coronal T2 MRI shows enlarged ovaries with multiple peripherally located small follicles, in the classic string of pearls configuration (arrows). 
• 
Polycystic ovarian syndrome is a clinical syndrome of obesity, insulin resistance, anovulation, and hirsutism secondary to excess androgens. 

• 
Ultrasound criteria include >12 small follicles (most often arranged around the periphery of the ovary), none greater than 9 mm in diameter, and an ovarian volume >10 mL. Ovarian volume is calculated by multiplying the diameters in three orthogonal planes by 0.52. 

• 
The ovarian stroma is typically very vascular when evaluated by color Doppler. 

• 
A differential consideration includes normal ovaries under the influence of oral contraceptives, although contraceptives will not increase the vascularity of the ovary. 


GU: 322 

Paraovarian cyst 
• A paraovarian cyst is a simple cyst separate from the ovary, thought to be developmental in 
origin. 
• 
Paraovarian cysts are considered normal if <5 cm. 

• 
The main differential is an ovarian cyst. Ovarian cysts should be reported (and followed) if >3 cm, while paraovarian cysts do not need to be followed unless >5 cm. Transvaginal ultrasound can help confirm extra-ovarian location via gentle pressure by the transducer, 


which displaces it away from the ovary. 
Peritoneal inclusion cyst 
• 
A peritoneal inclusion cyst is a septated fluid collection formed by adhesions, almost always related to prior surgery. The ovary is closely associated with the peritoneal inclusion cyst, either trapped within or adjacent to it. 

• 
It is important not to recommend surgery for treatment of a peritoneal inclusion cyst, as it is benign, and further surgery may create additional adhesions. 

• 
The main differential of a peritoneal inclusion cyst is a cystadenoma, which has thick septations and tends to exert mass effect. 


Dilated fallopian tube 
• The fallopian tube may become distended due to infection, inflammation, or traction from 
pelvic adhesions. 
• A hydrosalpinx is a fluid-filled fallopian tube lacking internal echoes. Ultrasound shows a dilated, anechoic, paraovarian tubular structure with incomplete septations that represent 
infolding of the tubular walls. 

Coronal (left image) and sagittal (right image) T2-weighted MRI show a tubular T2 hyperintense structure in the right adnexa (arrows) that did not enhance on postcontrast images (not shown), consistent with hydrosalpinx. 
• Hematosalpinx is a blood-filled fallopian tube that can be seen in the setting of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or endometriosis. Imaging will show internal echoes within the dilated tube. 
• Pyosalpinx is a pus-filled fallopian tube resulting from pelvic inflammatory disease. As in hematosalpinx, imaging will show internal echoes within the dilated tube.
