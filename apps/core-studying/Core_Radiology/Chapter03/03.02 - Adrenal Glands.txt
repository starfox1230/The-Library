Adrenal glands 
Anatomy 
• The adrenal glands are inverted Y-shaped endocrine glands that mediate the stress response 
by releasing cortisol and catecholamines. The adrenal glands are also a site of secondary sex hormone synthesis and blood pressure regulation (with aldosterone). 
• The adrenal glands have two distinct components, the cortex and medulla, with different 
embryological origins (the cortex is derived from mesothelium; the medulla is derived from 
neural crest). The cortex and medulla are susceptible to different diseases. 
• The adrenal glands are often asymmetric with the left gland thicker than the right. 
Adrenal cortex 
• The adrenal cortex is the peripheral portion of the gland and is composed of three layers that synthesize distinct hormones derived from cholesterol. 
Zona glomerulosa (most superficial): Produces aldosterone. Zona fasciculata: Produces glucocorticoids in response to pituitary adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Zone reticularis (deepest; closest to the adrenal medulla): Produces androgens. 
• Adrenal hyperplasia, adenoma, and cortical carcinoma are lesions that can be diagnosed on 
imaging. 

Adrenal medulla 
• 
The medulla is the central inner portion of the adrenal gland and it is associated with catecholamine production (norepinephrine and epinephrine, derived from tyrosine). 

• 
Masses that arise in the medulla include pheochromocytomas and neuroblastic tumors (ganglioneuroma, ganglioneuroblastoma, and neuroblastoma). Neuroblastoma is the most 


common extracranial solid tumor of childhood and is discussed in the pediatric imaging 
section. 


Biochemical approach to adrenal lesions 
• A patient may be suspected of having a hyperfunctioning adrenal lesion, based on clinical signs/symptoms or lab abnormalities. However, most incidental adrenal lesions are NOT hyperfunctioning. 
Adrenal hyperfunction 
• 
Cushing syndrome is caused by excess circulating cortisol by exogenous administration or endogenous production, as the result of pituitary (Cushing disease) or from non-pituitary disease, including idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia, adrenal adenoma, or ectopic/ paraneoplastic ACTH (e.g., from small cell lung cancer). 

• 
Conn syndrome is the result of excess aldosterone production, usually from an adrenal adenoma, resulting in hypertension and hypokalemia. Adenomas implicated in Conn syndrome are typically small and may be difficult to detect on CT. Localizing the side of excess hormone production with venous sampling may be a helpful diagnostic adjunct. 

• 
Adrenal cortical carcinoma is a very rare adrenal malignancy that arises from the cortex and 


typically causes an increase in levels of all cortical adrenal hormones and their precursors. 
• Pheochromocytomas usually arise from the adrenal medulla and can be associated with 
excess catecholamine production. This can result in episodic headaches, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and uncontrolled hypertension. 

Adrenal hypofunction 
• 
Substantial destruction of adrenal tissue is required to produce adrenal insufficiency. 

• 
Though usually not an imaging diagnosis, Addison disease represents chronic adrenocortical insufficiency. It can be caused by autoimmune destruction of the adrenal glands or by prior infection. 

• 
Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome is post-hemorrhagic adrenal failure secondary to Neisseria meningitidis bacteremia. 

• 
Idiopathic adrenal hemorrhage is usually unilateral and rarely causes adrenal hypofunction. 




Imaging of adrenal adenoma and the indeterminate adrenal mass 
Adrenal adenoma 
• Adrenal adenoma is a benign tumor of the adrenal cortex. Adenomas are usually incidental, 
but occasionally produce excess aldosterone that results in secondary hypertension (Conn 
syndrome). The majority of adrenal adenomas have two properties that allow for diagnosis by imaging: microscopic fat and/or rapid washout characteristics on contrast-enhanced CT. 
• An adrenal protocol CT (described below) is the best imaging study to evaluate for the 
presence of an adrenal adenoma. 
An adrenal nodule with attenuation =10 Hounsfield units (HU) on noncontrast CT can be reliably diagnosed 
as adenoma; 70–80% of adenomas measure <10 HU on noncontrast CT.  If a nodule measures >10 HU on noncontrast CT, IV contrast is administered to assess washout characteristics; 20–30% of adenomas measure >10 HU on noncontrast CT (lipid-poor adenoma).  
An adrenal adenoma has an absolute washout >60% or a relative washout >40%. 
• If a nodule does not meet CT density or washout criteria for an adenoma, it is considered indeterminate. In practice, an indeterminate adrenal nodule in a patient without known 
malignancy most likely represents a lipid-poor adenoma and advanced imaging is usually not 
required. 
• If diagnosis is required for further management (e.g., in a lung cancer patient without known metastatic disease), further workup is based on lesion size, history of malignancy, and availability of prior imaging. In some cases, FDG PET/CT and adrenal mass biopsy can be 
helpful. 
• A collision tumor represents co-existence of two tumors within an adrenal mass, such as metastasis within an adrenal adenoma or myelolipoma. 

Collision tumor: There is a left adrenal mass. Opposed phase MRI (left image) shows a crescentic lesion posterolaterally with signal drop-out (yellow arrows), in keeping with an adrenal adenoma. There is an additional lesion located anteromedially (red arrows), which does not demonstrate signal drop-out on opposed phase imaging, and which shows central necrosis with enhancement on post-contrast imaging (right image). 
If an “adenoma” appears heterogeneous or shows an interval increase in size, then a collision tumor should be considered in patients with a known primary malignancy, even if a portion of the lesion attenuates <10 HU. 

CT imaging: Adrenal washout CT 
• 
Typically, adrenal adenomas demonstrate rapid washout characteristics, while adrenal metastases demonstrate slow washout (<60% absolute washout; <40% relative washout). 

• 
The adrenal protocol study consists of three phases: unenhanced, enhanced (60 seconds post-injection), and delayed (15 minutes post-injection). 

• 
If an adrenal nodule measures <10 HU on noncontrast CT, adrenal adenoma is diagnosed and the exam is terminated. If the nodule measures >10 HU on noncontrast CT, IV contrast 


is administered and enhanced plus delayed imaging is obtained. 
• >60% absolute washout is diagnostic of adenoma. 
E – D enhanced attenuation – delayed attenuation % washout == E – U enhanced attenuation – unenhanced attenuation 

Unenhanced (precontrast) phase 60-second contrast-enhanced phase (adrenal parenchymal phase) 
Axial unenhanced, enhanced, and delayed images 
from adrenal washout protocol CT show an 
adrenal nodule measuring 16 HU, 112 HU, and 46 HU, respectively. 
Using the washout formula E – D/E – U:    (112 – 46) / (112 – 16) = 69% washout    >60% washout is diagnostic of an adenoma. 
Note is made of two large simple cysts of the left 
kidney.

• If unenhanced CT images are unavailable, relative washout calculation can still be performed 

by using the formula below. >40% relative washout is diagnostic of adenoma: 
E – D enhanced attenuation – delayed attenuation % relative washout == E enhanced attenuation 
• In a patient with a known primary malignancy, lesions that do not demonstrate benign washout kinetics are suspicious for, but not diagnostic of, metastasis. 


MRI adrenal imaging: Chemical shift imaging = in and out of phase imaging 
• Lipid-rich adenomas contain intracytoplasmic lipid. MRI can detect even small amounts of intracytoplasmic lipid that may be undetectable by CT. MRI takes advantage of the fact that 
protons resonate at different frequencies in fat and in water. Chemical shift imaging consists of paired GRE images obtained at different echo times (TEs): in-phase (IP) and out-of-phase (OOP). When fat and water are contained within the same voxel, OOP images will show a drop in signal intensity when compared to IP, due to cancellation effect caused by fat and water protons being in “opposite direction” (out of phase). Adenomas suppress on OOP images, while metastases 
generally do not. 

Axial MRI demonstrates signal dropout in a right adrenal mass (arrows) on OOP (right image) compared to IP (left image), consistent with a lipid-rich adenoma. 
• Some malignant adrenal masses may rarely contain intracytoplasmic lipid and lose signal on 
out-of-phase images: 
Well-differentiated adrenocortical carcinoma (very rare). Metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Liposarcoma (typically a predominantly fatty mass that is rarely confused with adrenal adenoma). 
Role of biopsy of an adrenal mass 

Adrenal biopsy: Fused axial PET-CT (left image) in a patient with lung cancer and indeterminate adrenal mass demonstrates an FDG-avid left adrenal mass (yellow arrow). Intraprocedural image from a CT-guided left adrenal biopsy with the patient decubitus demonstrates the deployed tract of the biopsy needle traversing the mass (yellow arrow). Pathology was metastatic lung cancer. 
• 
Percutaneous adrenal mass biopsy is a safe procedure often performed under CT guidance. It is very accurate in providing definitive diagnosis. 

• 
Biopsy is indicated for an adrenal mass that remains indeterminate after comprehensive imaging workup, particularly in the context of underlying malignancy. 


Myelolipoma 

Adrenal myelolipoma: Axial (left image) and coronal (right image) CT shows a predominantly fatty mass with a few circumscribed foci of soft-tissue attenuation in the left adrenal (arrows). The mass is clearly distinct from the kidney, as best seen on the coronal image.

• 
An adrenal myelolipoma is a benign neoplasm consisting of myeloid cells (i.e., erythrocyte precursors – not “myo” as in muscle) and fat cells. In rare cases, they can be extra-adrenal and are pathologically indistinguishable from extramedullary hematopoiesis, which occurs in patients with hematologic disorders. 

• 
An adrenal mass with macroscopic (gross) fat is virtually diagnostic of a myelolipoma. It is usually an incidental finding and can be large (>4 cm) at the time of diagnosis. There are few reports of adrenocortical carcinoma and metastatic carcinoma with macroscopic fat, but these cases are very rare. A retroperitoneal liposarcoma may mimic a myelolipoma, although liposarcoma typically presents as a large mass that may displace, rather than arise from, the adrenal. 

• 
An adrenal myelolipoma should not be confused with a renal angiomyolipoma (AML). These two entities are unrelated, although they do have similar names, are located in adjacent organs, and are both diagnosed by the presence of macroscopic fat. 


Adrenal cyst 
• 
Adrenal cysts are relatively uncommon but have typical imaging characteristics of benign cysts that occur elsewhere in the body: internal fluid content with thin, smooth, non-enhancing wall). 

• 
Endothelial adrenal cysts are the most common (45%) type and may be lymphatic or 


angiomatous in origin. 
• Pseudocysts secondary to adrenal hemorrhage represent 39% of adrenal cysts and lack an 
epithelial lining. Peripheral calcification may be present. 
• 
Epithelial cysts are rare, comprising only 9% of adrenal cysts. 

• 
Occasionally an adrenal cyst may have a complex appearance and can be difficult to differentiate from a cystic/necrotic neoplasm. In such a case, percutaneous aspiration or surgical resection may be considered. 

• 
Small, asymptomatic, simple cysts can be ignored. A cyst may rarely grow so large as to cause symptoms, such as dull pain or compression of the stomach/duodenum, but these 


cases are very uncommon. 
• Very rarely, hydatid disease may affect the adrenal glands, typically producing a complex cystic lesion with an internal membrane. 


Malignant (or potentially malignant) adrenal masses 
Pheochromocytoma: Potentially malignant 

Pheochromocytoma: Contrast-enhanced axial (left image) and coronal (right image) CT shows a large, heterogeneous mass (arrows) with central necrosis arising superior to the left kidney. The extra-renal origin is 
best appreciated on the coronal image. 
• A pheochromocytoma (intra-adrenal paraganglioma) is a neuroendocrine tumor that typically originates from the adrenal medulla.  Pheochromocytomas are composed of chromaffin cells that secrete catecholamines and can cause uncontrolled secondary hypertension and episodic headaches/diaphoresis. Approximately 90% of these tumors are benign. 
• 
Pheochromocytomas can be large and heterogeneous due to areas of necrosis, hemorrhage, and occasionally calcification. On CT, they demonstrate avid enhancement. On MRI, they demonstrate marked T2 hyperintensity (light bulb sign) and avid enhancement with variable washout kinetics. 

• 
Nuclear medicine Iodine-123 MIBG or Indium-111 pentetreotide scintigraphy, Gallium-68 DOTATATE PET/CT, or contrast-enhanced MRI can be used for detection of extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma, such as in the context of metastatic workup in patients with hereditary conditions that increase risk of developing pheochromocytoma (see below). 

• 
Pheochromocytoma/paragangliomas are associated with several syndromes: 


Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A and 2B: Typically bilateral intra-adrenal pheochromocytomas. 
von Hippel-Lindau. Neurofibromatosis type 1. 
Carney’s triad (gastric leiomyosarcoma, pulmonary chondroma, and paragangliomas) 
Hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma syndrome: SDHD gene mutation, paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas (50% risk of malignant pheochromocytomas). 
• 
The most common site of an extra-adrenal paraganglioma is the organ of Zuckerkandl, located along the aortic bifurcation to the level of the bladder. Although rare, when the bladder is involved, it can produce a distinctive clinical presentation of post-micturition syncope (syncope after urination). 

• 
Paragangliomas of the head and neck are generally called glomus tumors and may be associated with the tympanic membrane (glomus tympanicum), the jugular foramen (glomus jugulare), the carotid body (called a carotid body tumor), or the vagus nerve (glomus vagale). 


Pheochromocytoma (continued) 
• In theory, pheochromocytoma/paragangliomas should be diagnosed by urine/plasma catecholamines and metanephrines, with imaging reserved for localization and staging. In clinical practice, when patients have suspected pheochromocytoma (such as refractory hypertension), CT is often used as the first line imaging test to rule out an adrenal mass. 

Noncontrast coronal CT Contrast-enhanced coronal CT 
Pheochromocytoma in a different patient: 
Multiphase CT shows an avidly enhancing left adrenal mass (arrows). 
This mass demonstrates heterogeneous T2 hyperintensity on MRI (light bulb sign). 

Adrenal cortical carcinoma 


lymph nodes (red arrows) encasing the aorta, seen on the coronal image. Small intratumoral linear hyperattenuating region (blue arrows) may represent tumoral mineralization or hemorrhage. 
• 
Adrenal cortical carcinoma is a very rare malignancy, with a prevalence of approximately 1/1,000,000. Approximately 66% are functional, producing a disordered array of hormones that may manifest as Cushing syndrome, hyperaldosteronism, and virilization. 

• 
Adrenal cortical carcinoma usually presents as a large and heterogeneous mass on imaging 


studies. Internal necrosis and hemorrhage are typical features. 

Metastasis 
• Autopsy studies show that adrenal metastases are present in >25% of patients with a known 
primary malignancy. Lung cancer and melanoma are the most common adrenal primaries. 
As discussed earlier, washout study can distinguish metastasis from adenoma. 
Lymphoma 
• Primary adrenal lymphoma is rare, but should be suspected in the context of splenomegaly 
and/or lymphadenopathy. 


Diffuse adrenal disorders 
Adrenal hyperplasia 
• Adrenal hyperplasia is caused by a prolonged stress response or ectopic ACTH secretion. 
Adrenal hemorrhage 
• Adrenal hemorrhage can be spontaneous but, in adults, is usually due to anticoagulation or 
an underlying malignancy. 
• Hemorrhage may appear mass-like and is often heterogeneous on CT, but does not enhance on postcontrast images. When prior imaging is available, it should be suspected in the event of rapid onset of an adrenal mass. In this context, follow-up imaging can be helpful to confirm resolution and/or interval decrease in size. 

Noncontrast axial CT 

Adrenal calcification 

60-second delay postcontrast axial CT 
Adrenal hemorrhage: 
Multiphase adrenal protocol CT demonstrates a heterogeneous right adrenal mass (arrows) that does not demonstrate enhancement on postcontrast 
images (46 HU on all phases). 
This mass is new compared to imaging from only two 
weeks prior (not shown). 
Axial contrast-enhanced CT shows 
a coarse calcification in the left adrenal gland (arrow), which may be 
due to remote hemorrhage or prior granulomatous disease. 
• Adrenal calcifications are not infrequent but rarely cause adrenal hypofunction. Adrenal calcifications can be due to hemorrhage, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, tuberculosis, and 
histoplasmosis.
