Prostatic urethra (posterior urethra) 
• 
The prostatic urethra is lined with transitional epithelium. 

• 
The verumontanum is a prominent ridge of smooth muscle in the posterior portion of the prostatic urethra and the site of the paired ejaculatory duct orifices. The verumontanum is also the site of obstruction in posterior urethral valves in children. The prostatic utricle is a Müllerian duct derivative and is the blind-ending male homologue of the uterus and vagina, 


which is also located at the verumontanum. 
Membranous urethra (posterior urethra) 
• 
The membranous urethra is the shortest, least mobile urethral segment. 

• 
The membranous urethra is contained within the urogenital diaphragm, which contains the 


external urethral sphincter and the paired Cowper’s glands. 
Bulbous urethra (anterior urethra) 
• The bulbar urethra is the site of drainage of Cowper’s (or bulbourethral) glands. 
Penile urethra (anterior urethra) 
• 
The penile urethra is the longest urethral segment, lined with squamous epithelium. 

• 
The distal portion of the penile urethra is dilated at the glans penis. This dilation is called the 


fossa navicularis. 
• The glands of Littré are small mucous glands of the penile urethra. Normally, small ducts would be occluded by balloon during a retrograde urethrogram, and therefore would not opacify with injected contrast. The glands of Littré tend to opacify more prominently when inflamed in the setting of urethritis.

Imaging of the male urethra 
Retrograde urethrogram (RUG) 
• 
Retrograde urethrogram (RUG) provides excellent evaluation of the anterior urethra and may be performed to evaluate for suspected urethral injury, stricture, or fistula. 

• 
To perform a RUG, the fossa navicularis is cannulated with a sterile balloon-tipped catheter that is inflated with 1–2 mL saline. Subsequently, approximately 10 mL of contrast is hand-injected under fluoroscopy. 


Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) 
• 
Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) best evaluates the posterior urethra and is typically performed for evaluation of bladder and voiding function. 

• 
To perform a VCUG, a Foley catheter is sterilely placed in the bladder and subsequently contrast is instilled into the bladder. The patient initiates urination during fluoroscopy. 



Urethral stricture 
• 
Urethral strictures secondary to sexually transmitted disease (most commonly chronic urethritis from Neisseria gonorrhoeae) occur most commonly in the bulbous urethra. A complication of chronic urethral infection is a periurethral abscess, which may result in a urethroperineal fistula. 

• 
Post-traumatic saddle injury strictures also tend to occur in the bulbous urethra. 

• 
In contrast, an iatrogenic stricture from a Foley catheter tends to occur in the penile urethra at the penile-scrotal junction. 


Urethral trauma 

Type III urethral injury: Retrograde urethrogram (left image) shows free extravasation of contrast (arrows) at the bulbomembranous urethra (red arrows). Post-RUG CT shows the excreted contrast in the left inguinal space (arrows) and the deep pelvis. Pelvic fractures and gas from a projectile tract are partially seen.

• In the setting of trauma, if there is blood at the meatus, painful urination, or inability to void, a RUG should be performed emergently to exclude an urethral injury. If confirmed, a suprapubic catheter is typically placed. 
• There are five types of urethral injury. Type III, pictured above, is the most common, with disruption of the urogenital diaphragm and rupture of the bulbomembranous urethra with contrast extravasating both into the pelvis and out into the perineum.

Peyronie disease 
• 
Peyronie disease is an acquired condition associated with penile deformity and shortening of the penis that can lead to sexual dysfunction. A dorsal curvature is common, usually at the distal 1/3. It is caused by (palpable) plaque formation in the tunica albuginea and corpus cavernosum. The etiology is unclear but possibly associated with abnormal response to repetitive microtrauma, collagen vascular disease, or advancing age. 

• 
Peyronie disease has an acute phase that can last for 12–18 months, associated with pain and sometimes flaccidity during intercourse. In the chronic phase, penile deformity is most commonly dorsal curvature (77%) or lateral curvature (20%). Surgical intervention is indicated in cases of severe bending or shortening of the penis, and typically deferred until the chronic phase, to minimize theoretical recurrence of fibrosis. 

• 
Ultrasound is highly sensitive for penile plaques (which appear as localized echogenic thickening of the tunica albuginea) and calcifications. Plaques are most often seen on the dorsal surface (70%) or midshaft (42%). 

• 
MRI can be used in more complex cases for surgical planning, and better characterizes abnormal penile curvature. Plaques can be seen as focal areas of T1 and T2 hypointense thickening, but calcifications are difficult to see on MRI. CT has limited role in evaluation. 


Penile carcinoma 
• Penile cancer is relatively rare; squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) accounts for >95% of primary 
penile neoplasms and typically occurs in the glans penis. 
• Spread of penile cancer typically occurs via lymphatics and varies depending on the location of the primary lesion: skin of penis and prepuce to superficial inguinal nodes; glans penis to 
deep inguinal and external iliac nodes. The Buck fascia acts as a barrier for corporal invasion and hematogenous spread.  
• Two staging systems are used: TNM (most commonly) or Jackson classification. Important components of staging include invasion into the shaft/corpora and metastatic 
lymphadenopathy. 
• Lower stage (I/II disease) is usually curable with local resection with or without partial penectomy. High stage disease often requires palliative treatment.
