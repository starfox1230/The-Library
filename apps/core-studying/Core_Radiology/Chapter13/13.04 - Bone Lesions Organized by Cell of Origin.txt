Bone lesions organized by cell of origin 
Bone forming (osteo-) lesions 
Benign and incidental: Enostosis (bone island) 
• 
Enostosis (commonly called a bone island) is an extremely common incidental finding of a small spiculated osteoblastic focus. 

• 
A bone island is only clinically significant in that it may rarely be difficult to differentiate from an osteoblastic metastasis, osteoid osteoma, or a low-grade osteosarcoma. 

• 
A giant variant (>2 cm) may be most difficult to differentiate from low-grade osteosarcoma. 

• 
Bone scan of bone island is usually normal. 

• 
Osteopoikilosis is an autosomal dominant syndrome of multiple bone islands and keloid formation. 

• 
Osteopathia striata is a benign, asymptomatic sclerotic dysplasia characterized by linear bands of sclerosis in the long bones and fan-like sclerosis in the flat pelvic bones. Bone scan is typically normal.

• In contrast to a bone island, osteoma arises from cortex rather than medullary canal. 
Benign: Melorheostosis 
• Melorheostosis is a non-neoplastic proliferation of thickened and irregular cortex with a typical

• 
Melorheostosis is usually seen in a single lower limb, in the distribution of a single sclerotome. A sclerotome represents a zone supplied by a single sensory nerve. 

• 
Melorheostosis features intense 


uptake on bone scan. 

Benign: Osteoid osteoma 
• 
Osteoid osteoma is a benign osteoblastic lesion characterized by a nidus of osteoid tissue surrounded by reactive bone sclerosis. The etiology is controversial. Inflammatory, vascular, and viral causes have been proposed. 

• 
The classic clinical presentation is night pain relieved by aspirin in a teenager or young adult. 

• 
Osteoid osteoma tends to occur in the diaphyses of the leg long bones (femur and tibia) most commonly. About 20% occur in the posterior elements of the spine. Spinal osteoid osteoma is an important cause of painful scoliosis. 

• 
On radiography and CT, a lucent nidus is surrounded by sclerosis. There is often central calcification within the nidus. Bone scan will be positive, with the double density sign representing intense uptake centrally in the region of the nidus and adjacent reactive uptake corresponding to sclerosis. Osteoid osteoma can be difficult to see on MRI alone. The nidus is usually low-signal on T1-weighted images and reactive marrow edema can obscure the lesion on T2-weighted images. 





T1-weighted MRI Tc-99m MDP bone scan (posterior projection) 
Osteoid osteoma: CT shows a radiolucent nidus in the left sacral ala (posterior element location) with a large central calcification (yellow arrows) with adjacent sclerosis (red arrows). The lesion is less conspicuous on MRI and has very low signal on the T1-weighted image (yellow arrow). The posterior bone scan shows increased radiotracer uptake (yellow arrow) of the nidus, with a double density sign (red arrow; corresponding to reactive sclerosis). 
• Treatment of osteoid osteoma is interventional radiology radiofrequency ablation, surgical curettage, or resection. 
Benign: Osteoblastoma 

Axial CT Axial T2-weighted MRI 

Osteoblastoma: 
Axial CT image of the cervical spine shows an expansile lytic lesion (arrows) involving the right aspect of the C5 vertebral body with extension posterolaterally to the lateral mass and lamina. Axial MR images of the same lesion show that it is slightly T2 hyperintense to muscle on T2-weighted image and enhancing on post-contrast T1 image. Biopsy showed osteoblastoma. 
• 
Osteoblastoma is a benign osteoid-producing tumor that is histologically the same as an osteoid osteoma but is greater than 2 cm in size. 

• 
Osteoblastoma is approximately 4 times less common than osteoid osteoma, although it also occurs in the adolescent/young adult age range and also presents with pain. Interestingly, the pain of osteoblastoma is not typically relieved by aspirin. 

• 
The most common location is the posterior elements of the spine, occurring anywhere from the cervical spine through the sacrum. Osteoblastoma may also occur in the femur and tibia. 

• 
The most common radiographic appearance of osteoblastoma is a lytic lesion with mineralization. Very rarely, osteoblastoma may be aggressive with large soft-tissue mass, but lacking metastatic potential. Secondary aneurysmal bone cyst may be seen, especially when spinal in location. 

• 
A lytic lesion in the posterior elements of a young person may represent an osteoblastoma or aneurysmal bone cyst. If any mineralization is present within the lesion, osteoblastoma should be favored. 


Malignant: Osteosarcoma 
• 
Osteosarcoma represents a heterogeneous group of malignant tumors where the neoplastic cells are derived form osteoid lineage and most subtypes produce an osteoid matrix. 

• 
Osteosarcoma can be primary or secondary. Secondary osteosarcoma may arise from Paget disease or after radiation. Secondary osteosarcoma in Paget disease is extremely aggressive. 

• 
General imaging hallmarks of osteosarcoma are bony destruction, production of osteoid matrix, aggressive periosteal reaction, and an associated soft-tissue mass. Early osteosarcoma may be only evident as subtle sclerosis. 

• 
There are more than 10 primary subtypes. The 4 most important subtypes are conventional (most common), telangiectatic, and the two juxtacortical subtypes including parosteal (pronounced PAR-osteal) and periosteal (pronounced PERI-osteal). 

• 
Conventional (intramedullary) osteosarcoma represents 75% of osteosarcomas and occurs in adolescents/young adults usually about the knee in the metaphysis of the femur or tibia. 


Conventional osteosarcoma features an intramedullary osteoid matrix, both intramedullary and cortical bone destruction, aggressive periosteal reaction (sunburst or Codman), and a soft-tissue mass. 


Radiograph Post-contrast T1-weighted MRI with fat suppression. 
Conventional osteosarcoma with classic radiographic appearance: Frontal radiograph of the femur in a skeletally immature patient shows a heterogeneous mass in the distal femoral metaphysis with aggressive sunburst periosteal reaction and cloud-like osteoid matrix (yellow arrows). Coronal MR images show a heterogeneously T2 hyperintense mass with soft tissue extension and extensive enhancing periosteal reaction. 

Radiograph T1-weighted MRI T2-weighted MRI with fat supp. 
Conventional osteosarcoma, subtle on radiography: Radiograph (left image) shows a region of subtle sclerosis in the medial proximal tibial metaphysis (arrow). No periosteal reaction is apparent, which is unusual for osteosarcoma. T1-weighted MRI shows a well-defined region of marrow replacement by tumor (red arrows). T2-weighted MRI with fat suppression demonstrates diffuse marrow edema in the tibia, with a region of decreased T2 signal (arrow) likely corresponding to the sclerosis seen on radiograph. 
Osteosarcoma (continued) 
Telangiectatic osteosarcoma is an osteolytic destructive sarcoma which may mimic a benign aneurysmal bone cyst on imaging. 

Radiograph Coronal T2-weighted MRI with fat suppression. 


Telangiectatic osteosarcoma: Frontal radiograph of the knee in a skeletally immature patient shows an ill-
defined, permeative lytic lesion (yellow arrows) in the distal femoral metaphysis. Coronal T2FS MRI in the same patient shows a heterogeneous lesion with T2 hyperintense cystic spaces (red arrows), with axial images demonstrating fluid-fluid levels (blue arrow). 
Coronal T1 post-contrast image shows some nodular areas of contrast enhancement within the lesion 
(green arrow). The presence of solid nodular components on MRI helps to differentiate a telangiectatic osteosarcoma from a benign aneurysmal bone cyst. 
Unlike other osteosarcomas, telangiectatic osteosarcoma does not produce any bony matrix. Pathologically, telangiectatic osteosarcoma is vascular with large cystic spaces filled with blood. Although telangiectatic osteosarcoma is an aggressive lesion, new treatment options increase survival, 
which is now slightly improved compared to a conventional osteosarcoma. 
Osteosarcoma (continued) 
• Parosteal (PAR-osteal) osteosarcoma is a juxtacortical osteosarcoma that arises from the outer periosteum. It most commonly occurs at the posterior aspect of distal femoral metaphysis and has a cauliflower-like exophytic morphology (mnemonic: par-boil cauliflower before eating). A lucent line may be seen separating it from the cortex. 


Radiograph Sagittal post-contrast T1-weighted MRI with fat suppression. 
Parosteal osteosarcoma: Frontal radiograph of the femur shows a large exophytic “cauliflower-like” mass involving the femoral diaphysis (arrows). Sagittal T1 post-contrast image in the same patient shows the large lobulated mass with peripheral enhancement (arrow). Axial T1 post-contrast images again demonstrate the cauliflower-like lobulations with peripheral enhancement (arrows). 
Patients are usually in their third and fourth decades, older compared to other osteosarcoma subtypes. Parosteal osteosarcoma is the least malignant of all osteosarcomas, with ~90% five-year survival. 
• Periosteal (PERI-osteal) osteosarcoma, the other juxtacortical osteosarcoma, is a rare osteosarcoma variant arising from the inner periosteum. It features cortical thickening, aggressive periosteal reaction, and a soft-tissue mass. Histologically, periosteal osteosarcoma may show chondroid differentiation. 

Radiograph Sagittal PD-weighted MRI Sagittal post-contrast T1-weighted MRI with fat suppression. 
Periosteal osteosarcoma: Lateral radiograph of the knee shows a mass in the anterior proximal tibial diaphysis with associated soft tissue mass and periosteal reaction (arrow). Sagittal PD-weighted MRI shows an intermediate signal intensity mass (arrow) abutting the anterior tibial periosteum, with post-contrast image showing heterogeneous enhancement. Excisional biopsy showed periosteal osteosarcoma. 
The most common location of periosteal osteosarcoma is the diaphysis of the femur or tibia. 
Patients tend to be younger than 20 years old. 
Osteosarcoma (continued) 
• Regardless of subtype, osteosarcoma has a propensity to metastasize to lungs, where the metastases may or may not calcify. 

Frontal radiograph 
shows innumerable 
calcified 
osteosarcoma metastases in 
the thorax and visualized portion of the upper abdomen, demonstrating fluffy osteoid matrix. 

Metastatic osteosarcoma (different patient from above): 
Axial maximum intensity projection from initial staging CT (left image) demonstrates several bilateral lower lobe noncalcified subcentimeter nodules (arrows), in keeping with metastatic disease. 
Follow-up axial chest CT image performed three years later demonstrates post-treatment changes in the left hemithorax with linear consolidation in keeping with post-radiation changes (red arrows). There has been interval development of a calcified medial left lower lobe nodule (blue arrow). 


Cartilage-forming (chondro-) lesions 
Benign: Synovial chondromatosis / osteochondromatosis 

Synovial osteochondromatosis: Frontal external rotation (left image) and internal rotation (right image) radiographs of the shoulder show multiple small round calcifications tracking along the expected location of the long head of the biceps tendon sheath (arrows). 
• 
Synovial chondromatosis is non-neoplastic synovial metaplasia characterized by the formation of intra-articular lobulated cartilaginous nodules, which may or may not ossify. It is usually a monoarticular disorder. 

• 
The cartilaginous foci often ossify, in which case the term osteochondromatosis is used. 

• 
Synovial proliferation tends not to directly cause arthropathy, although the intra-articular nodules may cause mechanical erosions and secondary osteoarthritis. 

• 
The most common location is the knee. The shoulders, hip, and elbow may also be affected. 

• 
Radiography shows multiple round intra-articular bodies of similar size and variable mineralization. The primary differential is intra-articular bodies from osteoarthritis; however, in osteoarthritis the bodies tend to be more varied in size and shape and fewer in number. Diagnosis can be difficult in the absence of calcification, especially if mechanical erosions are present. 

• 
MRI appearances are variable, depending on the degree of ossification and the presence of chondroid matrix. When calcified or ossified, MRI will show multiple globular and rounded foci of low signal. 

• 
The MRI finding of multiple intra-articular low-intensity foci can also be seen in pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS). A radiograph will clearly show rounded calcified bodies in osteochondromatosis. 

• 
Very rarely, malignant degeneration to chondrosarcoma may occur. 


Benign: Enchondroma 
• 
Enchondroma is a benign lesion of mature hyaline cartilage rests. 

• 
In the long bones, enchondroma features characteristic chondroid (popcorn or ring and arc) calcifications. 

• 
The differential diagnosis of enchondroma includes medullary bone infarct (which produces serpentine sclerosis) and chondrosarcoma. 

• 
MRI is usually able to differentiate between infarct and enchondroma. Enchondroma has a characteristic lobulated hyperintense signal on T2­weighted images. 



Radiograph of the distal femur shows an enchondroma with characteristic ring and arc chondroid-type calcification (arrow). 
• 
When occurring in the hand, enchondroma typically does not produce visible matrix and appears as a geographic lytic lesion. 

• 
Enchondroma may be complicated by pathologic fracture, especially in the hand. 



Enchondroma of the middle finger proximal phalanx (left image) complicated by pathologic fracture seen in a subsequent radiograph (right image). The enchondroma (arrow) has no perceptible chondroid matrix, which is a typical appearance of an enchondroma in the hand. Note the interval partial fusion of the physes which occurred in the time interval between the two radiographs. 
• Enchondroma may undergo malignant transformation. Aside from Ollier and Maffucci syndrome (subsequently discussed), malignant transformation to chondrosarcoma is very rare, with a potential worrisome clinical finding being new pain in the absence of fracture. 
There are no universally accepted guidelines for follow-up of enchondromas. Enchondromas measuring <4 cm about the knee or shoulder are very common and likely do not need 
to be followed if there is no endosteal scalloping. Enchondromas of the pelvic bones or hip may be at increased risk for malignant transformation and many practitioners feel they should be followed. On follow-up imaging, increase in degree of endosteal scalloping, cortical thinning, or increase in 
size are worrisome findings. A progressive decrease in mineralizations is also worrisome for potential malignant transformation. In contrast, progressive increase in rings-and-arcs type mineralizations suggests maturation of the enchondroma, and is not associated with increased malignancy. 
Benign: Enchondroma (continued) 

Frontal radiograph Post-contrast coronal T1-weighted MRI with fat supp. 
Benign enchondroma, with malignant transformation 11 years later: Initial radiographs demonstrate a very subtle region of punctate mineralizations (yellow arrows) in the humeral head. MRI demonstrates a lobulated, circumscribed mass (yellow arrows) in the humeral head without endosteal scalloping. 

Frontal radiograph Post-contrast sagittal T1-weighted MRI with fat supp. 

Sagittal T1-weighted MRI Axial PD-weighted MRI with fat suppression 
Chondrosarcoma, arising from malignant degeneration of enchondroma: Radiographs and MRI in the same patient as above, obtained 11 years later, demonstrate a subtle lytic lesion of the humeral head (arrows). 
MR imaging shows a large T1 hypointense, T2 hyperintense, enhancing mass in the proximal humerus with cortical thinning anteriorly (red arrow). The mass is markedly enlarged since 11 years prior, and involves nearly the entire marrow cavity. Note the punctate mineralizations (blue arrows), which have not increased since 11 years. 
Please note that malignant transformation of an isolated enchondroma is extremely rare, and it is not typical clinical practice to follow benign-appearing enchondromas indefinitely. 
Benign: Enchondroma (continued) 
• On MRI, enchondromas typically are circumscribed, lobulated, T2 hyperintense masses. 

Enchondroma on radiograph and MRI: Lateral knee radiograph (left image) shows ring and arcs mineralization in the distal femoral diaphysis (arrows), in keeping with an enchondroma. Sagittal T2­weighted MRI with fat suppression demonstrates the typical imaging features of enchondroma, with a lobulated, circumscribed, T2 hyperintense mass (arrows). While not fully visualized in these images, there was no endosteal scalloping, cortical thinning, or soft tissue mass to suggest a more aggressive lesion. 
• Multiple enchondromas are seen in Ollier (multiple enchondromas only) and Maffucci (multiple enchondromas and venous malformations producing phleboliths) syndromes, the two familial enchondromatoses. Both syndromes carry an increased risk of malignant transformation to chondrosarcoma, with a higher risk in Maffucci syndrome. 

Frontal radiograph of the foot in a patient with Maffucci syndrome shows numerous expansile enchondromas most prominently in the great toe (red arrows). Multiple phleboliths (yellow arrows) represent soft-tissue venous malformations. 
Note the relative paucity of chondroid calcification, which is typical of the enchondromas seen in Maffucci syndrome. 
Benign: Osteochondroma 
• 
An osteochondroma is a benign cartilage-capped bony growth projecting outward from bone, often pedunculated. It is the most common benign bone lesion. 

• 
Osteochondroma may present clinically as a palpable mass, which usually stops growing at skeletal maturity. 

• 
Key features are the continuity of cortex of host bone with the cortex of the osteochondroma and communication of the medullary cavities. Osteochondroma arises from the metaphysis and grows away from the epiphysis. 


• An uncommon complication is malignant transformation to chondrosarcoma. Like enchondroma, the presence of pain in the absence of a pathologic fracture is a red flag. An associated soft-tissue mass is usually 
present with malignant transformation. A cartilage cap thickness >2 cm on MRI suggests malignant transformation to chondrosarcoma. 
• Multiple osteochondromas can be seen in multiple hereditary exostoses (MHE), with increased risk for malignant transformation. MHE is an autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia, with the knees most commonly involved. 


Multiple hereditary exostoses (MHE): Multiple radiographs from a skeletal survey of a single patient with MHE demonstrates multiple sessile and pedunculated osteochondromas about the hips, left iliac crest, chest wall, both knees, and right humerus. 
Benign: Chondroblastoma 
• 
Chondroblastoma is a benign lesion located eccentrically in the epiphysis of a long bone in a skeletally immature patient. It most commonly occurs about the knee or proximal humerus. 

• 
Calcified chondroid matrix is present on almost all CT studies, but is seen only ~50% of the time on radiographs. 

• 
Chondroblastoma is unique amongst chondroid lesions in that it typically demonstrates low or intermediate signal on T2-weighted images. Most chondroid lesions are T2 hyperintense. 

• 
Treatment is with curettage, cryosurgery, or radiofrequency ablation. There is a low risk of local recurrence. Chondroblastoma is very rarely malignant. 


Benign: Chondromyxoid fibroma 
• 
Chondromyxoid fibroma is a very rare, benign cartilage tumor that is typically eccentric in the tibial or femoral metaphysis about the knee. It rarely demonstrates chondroid matrix. 

• 
It usually has sclerotic margins on radiography and is high in signal on T2-weighted MRI. 


Malignant: Chondrosarcoma 

Chondrosarcoma: Frontal radiograph of the pelvis (left image) and coronal T1-weighted MRI (right image) show an exophytic lesion (arrows) arising from the right iliac crest, which is continuous with the intramedullary cavity. The lesion demonstrates ring and arc chondroid-type calcification on radiography, and is heterogeneously hyperintense with a lobulated appearance on T2-weighted MRI (arrows).

Chondrosarcoma in a different patient: 
Frontal and lateral radiographs of the distal femur show an intramedullary lesion with ring and arc chondroid calcifications. Periosteal reaction (yellow arrow) and cortical disruption (red arrow) suggest aggressive behavior. 
Case courtesy Stacy Smith, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
Chondrosarcoma (continued) 
• 
Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor of cartilage. Like osteosarcoma, there are multiple primary and secondary variants. 

• 
Secondary forms arise from enchondroma (more commonly in the Maffucci and Ollier familial enchondromatoses), Paget disease, and osteochondroma (more common in familial osteochondromatosis). 


An osteochondroma with a cartilage cap thickness of >2 cm is highly suggestive of chondrosarcoma. 
• 
The conventional (intramedullary) chondrosarcoma subtype is most common. On imaging, chondrosarcoma is typically an expansile lesion in the medullary bone, with ring and arc chondroid matrix. The tumor causes thickening and endosteal scalloping of the cortex, and there is often an associated soft-tissue mass. 

• 
The dedifferentiated subtype of chondrosarcoma is aggressive and may contain fibrosarcoma or osteosarcoma elements. 

• 
Other subtypes of chondrosarcoma include the rare mesenchymal and clear cell variants. 




Lesions of fibrous origin 
Benign: Nonossifying fibroma / fibrous cortical defect 

Nonossifying fibroma: Frontal (left image) and lateral (right image) radiographs of the proximal lateral tibia in a 17-year-old male show a well-defined lucent lesion in the medial tibial metaphysis. The lesion features a faint sclerotic rim in continuity with the thinned lateral cortex (arrow). 
• 
Nonossifying fibroma (sometimes called a fibroxanthoma) is an asymptomatic and common incidental radiolucent lesion in the long bones (especially the leg) in children and adolescents. Nonossifying fibroma and fibrous cortical defect are thought to represent the same lesion; the term nonossifying fibroma is generally reserved for larger (>2 cm) or symptomatic lesions. They are the same histologically. These lesions are believed to arise from the periosteum. 

• 
The radiographic appearance is usually diagnostic and demonstrates a lucent lesion with a narrow zone of transition, sclerotic margin, and no matrix calcification. CT or MRI may show cortical disruption or thinning, representing replacement of the cortex by fibrous tissue. 

• 
Most lesions undergo spontaneous sclerotic involution as the patient reaches adulthood. 



Benign: Fibrous dysplasia 
• 
Fibrous dysplasia is a benign congenital non-neoplastic condition of children and young adults characterized by replacement of normal cancellous bone by abnormal fibrous tissue. 

• 
Fibrous dysplasia can affect one bone (monostotic) or multiple bones (polyostotic). When polyostotic, it tends to be unilateral. 

• 
The most frequent complication is pathologic fracture, commonly at the femoral neck. 

• 
Fibrous dysplasia of the long bones tends to be central and metadiaphyseal, often causing a bowing deformity such as the extreme varus of the shepherd’s crook. 




• 
In the ribs or long bones, the matrix is typically indistinct and ground glass. 

• 
In the pelvic bones, fibrous dysplasia is often cystic. 



A lucent lesion of the right iliac bone (yellow arrows) shows intermediate to hyperintense signal on proton-density-weighted MRI, with a subtle fluid level (red arrow). The differential diagnosis of a cystic supra-acetabular lesion in a young adult includes cystic fibrous dysplasia and unicameral bone cyst. 

Fibrous dysplasia (continued) 
• In the skull base, fibrous dysplasia is typically expansile and can look highly unusual on MRI. The primary differential of an expansile skull base lesion is Paget disease, but the age of the patient is the key: Fibrous dysplasia occurs in children and young adults and Paget occurs in older adults. 



Coronal CT and T1-weighted MRI in the same patient show the true extent of the abnormality (arrows). 
Case courtesy Mary Beth Cunnane, MD, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Boston. 
• 
McCune-Albright syndrome is polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, precocious puberty, and cutaneous café au lait spots. 

• 
Mazabraud syndrome is fibrous dysplasia and intramuscular myxomas, which tend to occur in the same region of the body. 




Lesions of vascular origin 
Benign: Hemangioma 

Lateral radiograph of the lumbosacral spine shows mild Sagittal CT shows coarsened, vertically oriented loss of height of the L5 vertebral body with a subtle trabeculae with a typical corduroy appearance in L5 lace-like striated trabecular appearance (arrow). (arrow). 


• 
Hemangioma is a benign lesion that typically occurs in the vertebral body, characterized by vascular channels lined by endothelial cells. 

• 
Although usually incidental, rarely a hemangioma may be associated with a soft-tissue mass that can cause neurologic compromise. 

• 
Hemangioma causes reactive trabecular thickening in response to bony resorption by vascular channels. 

• 
On MRI, high signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images are from fat contained within the hemangioma. On radiography and CT, corduroy striations are typical. The polka-dot sign demonstrates thickened trabeculae imaged in cross-section. 


Malignant: Angiosarcoma of bone 
• Angiosarcoma looks and acts aggressively. Lung metastases are often seen. 

Lesions of hematopoietic origin 
(Usually) benign: Giant cell tumor (osteoclastoma) 

Giant cell tumor: 
Frontal radiograph of the knee in a skeletally mature individual shows an eccentric lucent lesion (arrows) in the lateral tibial epiphysis and metaphysis extending to the articular surface. 
Case courtesy Scott Sheehan, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston. 
• 
Giant cell tumor is an epiphyseal lucent lesion located eccentrically at the articular end of long bones in skeletally mature patients between ages 20 and 40. It arises from the metaphysis but crosses the closed epiphyseal plate to involve the epiphysis. The cell of origin is a multinucleated giant cell, similar in appearance to an osteoclast. 

• 
Most giant cell tumors are benign. Approximately 5% are malignant, but it is impossible to differentiate behavior based on the appearance of the primary lesion. 

• 
Multifocal giant cell tumors can be seen in Paget disease or hyperparathyroidism. 

• 
Treatment is typically curettage or wide resection. 


Benign: Eosinophilic granuloma (Langerhans cell histiocytosis) 
• 
A disorder of immune regulation, Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is caused by an abnormal proliferation of histiocytes. LCH is primarily seen in children 5–10 years old and is discussed more in-depth in the pediatric imaging section. 

• 
In the skull, the classic appearance of LCH is a lytic lesion with a beveled edge. 

• 
In the mandible or maxilla, LCH may cause a floating tooth from resorption of alveolar bone. 

• 
In the spine, LCH may cause vertebra plana, which is complete collapse of vertebral body. 



Vertebra plana in eosinophilic granuloma: 
Lateral cervical spine radiograph in a 12-year­old girl with known eosinophilic granuloma demonstrates severe compression of the C6 vertebra (arrow) with a vertebra plana appearance. 
• In the long bones, LCH may appear as a destructive radiolucent lesion with aggressive (often lamellated) periosteal reaction that may look like lymphoma or Ewing sarcoma. 
Malignant: Ewing sarcoma 

Frontal radiograph Axial post-contrast T1-weighted MRI with fat suppression 

Ewing sarcoma: 
Frontal radiograph in an 8-year-old girl shows a permeative lytic lesion of the distal fibular diaphysis (yellow arrow), near the site of pain as indicated by the dashed arrow. 
MR images show the an extensive soft tissue mass (red arrows) centered on the fibula with intramedullary edema and enhancement (blue arrow) and cortical thinning. 
There is a nondisplaced pathologic fracture of the fibula (green arrow), best seen on the coronal MR. 
• 
Ewing sarcoma is a highly malignant small round cell tumor (similar to PNET) affecting children and adolescents with a male predominance. The clinical presentation is nonspecific. Ewing sarcoma usually presents with pain. Systemic symptoms including fever are often present, making the distinction between Ewing sarcoma and osteomyelitis difficult. 

• 
Ewing sarcoma is the second most common pediatric primary bone tumor (following osteosarcoma). 

• 
Radiographic features are of an aggressive lesion, with permeative bone destruction, aggressive periosteal reaction, and often an associated soft-tissue mass. 

• 
In addition to Ewing sarcoma, the differential of an aggressive lytic lesion in a child includes osteomyelitis, eosinophilic granuloma, and metastatic neuroblastoma. 


Malignant: Multiple myeloma (MM)/ Plasmacytoma 

Multiple myeloma: Frontal and lateral radiographs of the skull (top images) show innumerable tiny lytic lesions. AP (bottom left image) and lateral (bottom right image) radiographs of the femur show a permeative appearance (yellow arrow), with focal cortical thinning anteriorly best seen on the lateral view (red arrow). 
• 
Multiple myeloma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in patients over 40. 

• 
By far the most common presentation of myeloma is multiple lytic lesions, with the most severe form being diffuse myelomatosis with endosteal scalloping. 

• 
Sclerosing myelomatosis is an uncommon variant, associated with POEMS syndrome: Polyneuropathy. Organomegaly (liver/spleen). Endocrine disturbances (amenorrhea/gynecomastia). Monoclonal gammopathy. Skin changes (hirsutism and hyperpigmentation). 

• 
The main differential of multiple lytic lesions in an adult is metastatic disease. Multiple myeloma originates from the red marrow and usually does not involve regions where there is minimal red marrow, such as the pedicles in the spine. Multiple myeloma may be negative on bone scan, unlike most metastases. 

• 
A solitary tumor is a plasmacytoma. Most patients with plasmacytoma will get full-blown multiple myeloma within 5 years. 


Malignant: Lymphoma 
• 
Primary bone lymphoma is very rare and tends to occur in adults over 40. 

• 
Bone lymphoma appears as an aggressive lytic lesion, but may also be an important differential consideration for an ivory (diffusely sclerotic) vertebral body. 

• 
Lymphoma is often associated with an adjacent soft-tissue mass. 




Fat (lipo-) lesions 
Benign: Intraosseous Iipoma 

Lateral radiograph of the ankle shows a nonspecific circumscribed lucent lesion in the calcaneus (arrows) with a thin rim of peripheral sclerosis. 
The differential for this lesion would include intraosseous lipoma, simple bone cyst, or aneurysmal bone cyst. 
If central or ring-like calcification were present, that would more strongly favor intraosseous lipoma. 
• Intraosseous lipoma is an uncommon benign neoplasm. The most common sites are the calcaneus, subtrochanteric region of the femur, distal tibia/fibula, and metatarsals. Imaging can be variable depending on the degree of fat, calcification, fibrous tissue, and peripheral sclerosis. Central or ring-like calcification is often present. 


Notochordal lesions 
Malignant: Chordoma 

Sagittal T2-weighted MRI with fat suppression Post-contrast axial T1-weighted MRI with fat suppression Sacral chordoma: There is a lobulated, T2 hyperintense mass (yellow arrows) arising from the sacrum, with destruction of the coccyx. The mass is predominantly midline, extending into the right perineal and pararectal soft tissues. The mass is largely hypovascular (red arrows), with septational enhancement anteriorly (blue arrows). 
• 
Chordoma is a malignant lesion deriving from a notochord remnant. It arises in the midline of the axial skeleton, either in the spheno-occipital region, body of C2 (less commonly other vertebral bodies), or sacrococcygeal location. 

• 
Chordoma is a destructive lytic lesion with irregular scalloped borders. 

• 
Calcifications may be present, which are due to necrosis, not bone formation. On MRI, chordomas have lobulated T2 hyperintense signal with heterogeneous enhancement. 



Lesions of unknown cell origin 
Benign: Simple bone cyst (SBC), also called unicameral bone cyst (UBC) 

Solitary bone cyst: Frontal and lateral radiographs of the proximal tibia in a skeletally immature patient show a central, expansile lesion of the proximal tibia. A pathologic fracture is present with a displaced bone fragment (red arrows), representing the fallen fragment sign. T2-weighted MRI with fat suppression (right image) shows multiple fluid levels (yellow arrows). The differential diagnosis incudes an aneurysmal bone cyst.

• 
Simple bone cyst/unicameral bone cyst is the result of a benign local disturbance of bone growth in children and adolescents. 

• 
The lesion is either hollow or fluid-filled and typically found in the proximal diaphysis of the humerus or femur. Less common locations include the calcaneus or iliac bone. 

• 
SBC lacks periosteal reaction (in contrast to aneurysmal bone cyst), as long as there is no fracture. 

• 
Up to 66% of cases are complicated by pathologic fracture. The fallen fragment sign represents a cortical fracture fragment that has fallen into the cyst. It is pathognomonic for SBC when seen in a young patient in a lesion in an appropriate location for SBC. 

• 
SBC is always located centrally within a bone. 

• 
Fluid-fluid levels are seen on MRI. Fluid levels are nonspecific and can also be seen in aneurysmal bone cyst, giant cell tumor, and telangiectatic osteosarcoma. 

• 
One nonsurgical treatment option is the intra-lesional injection of methylprednisolone, which induces osteogenesis. 


Benign: Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) 
• 
Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is an expansile or “aneurysmal” multicystic lesion seen in children and adolescents. 

• 
Histologically, ABC is made of blood-filled sinusoids and solid fibrous elements. ABC may arise secondarily within a pre-existing tumor. This is important to consider if an aggressive lesion is biopsied and the pathology returns ABC, as this may imply that the true lesion was not sampled. 

• 
Unlike SBC, ABC can be located anywhere in bone (central or eccentric). It may occur in the posterior elements of the spine. Unlike SBC, ABC often features a “buttressing” smooth periosteal reaction at the proximal and distal aspects. Like SBC, fluid levels are present. 


Malignant: Adamantinoma 
• Adamantinoma is a very rare malignant lytic lesion in the tibia with a soap-bubble appearance. It may be difficult to differentiate from fibrous dysplasia. 

Osseous metastasis 
• 
Osseous metastases are over 10 times more common than primary bone tumors. 

• 
Most metastases occur in the red bone marrow, most commonly in the axial skeleton. 

• 
It can be difficult to differentiate a pathologic vertebral body fracture (associated with an underlying tumor) from an osteoporotic fracture, but involvement of the pedicle or posterior vertebral body suggests metastasis. 

• 
A fracture of the lesser trochanter in an adult should raise concern for pathologic fracture. 

• 
A solitary sternal lesion is highly predictive of metastasis in a patient with breast cancer. 


Lytic osseous metastases Blastic (sclerotic) osseous metastases 
• 
Lung (most common purely lytic). • Breast (lytic or blastic). 

• 
Breast (lytic or blastic). • Prostate, seminoma. 

• 
Thyroid. • Transitional cell carcinoma. 

• 
Kidney. • Mucinous tumors. 

• 
Stomach, colon (lytic or blastic). • Carcinoid. 



Benign tumor mimics 
Myositis ossificans 

Myositis ossificans: 
Lateral radiograph of the elbow shows peripheral osteoid within a mass abutting the anterior humeral cortex. The peripheral ossification (arrows) suggests myositis ossificans, at least 5 weeks old. 
The main differential diagnosis is parosteal osteosarcoma; however, the peripheral ossification more strongly suggests myositis ossificans. This case was followed and confirmed by close-interval follow-up imaging. 
• 
Myositis ossificans (MO) is heterotopic bone formation in the skeletal muscle secondary to trauma, although the history of trauma may not be remembered and the trauma may be minor. MO most commonly occurs around the elbow and thigh, which are prone to trauma. 

• 
Myositis ossificans may mimic parosteal osteosarcoma. Parosteal osteosarcoma is usually more heavily calcified centrally, while myositis ossificans is typically more calcified peripherally. 

• 
If myositis ossificans is suspected, a biopsy should not be performed. A biopsy can lead to unnecessary surgery, as the histology may resemble sarcoma. 

• 
The appearance of myositis ossificans evolves over a period of weeks to months: 


Weeks 1–2: Soft-tissue mass only. 
Weeks 3–4: Formation of amorphous osteoid matrix. May cause periosteal reaction of adjacent bone. This stage is most suggestive of an early osteosarcoma. Weeks 5–8: The periphery of the lesion matures into compact bone. Up to 6 months: Ossification continues to mature. >6 months: Typically decreases in size. 
Brown tumor 

Brown tumor: Axial CT (left image) shows a nonspecific lytic lesion with a faint sclerotic margin in the left superior pubic ramus (arrow) in a patient with renal osteodystrophy and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Note the rugger jersey spine on the sagittal CT with alternating bands of sclerosis (yellow arrows) and relative central lucency (red arrow). 
• 
A brown tumor is a benign lytic lesion seen in patients with hyperparathyroidism, caused by increased osteoclast activation. 

• 
Brown tumor does not have any specific imaging features and may be difficult to differentiate from a giant cell tumor both radiologically and pathologically. 

• 
Associated features of hyperparathyroidism are usually present, including: 


Osteopenia. 
Subperiosteal bone resorption (especially of the radial aspect of the second and third middle phalanges and the acromial ends of clavicles). Soft-tissue calcifications. 
• 
Lab abnormalities associated with hyperparathyroidism (in addition to elevated PTH level) include elevated calcium and decreased phosphorus. 

• 
If hyperparathyroidism is secondary to renal failure, secondary findings of renal osteodystrophy may be seen as well, such as rugger jersey spine. 



Osteomyelitis 
• Osteomyelitis, subsequently discussed, may cause a permeative or lytic bony lesion that can be indistinguishable from an aggressive malignancy. 

Cortical desmoid 
• 
A cortical desmoid is a classic “do not touch” lesion. 

• 
Pathophysiology is due to repetitive stress at the attachment of the medial head of gastrocnemius or distal adductor magnus. 

• 
On radiograph, cortical desmoid lesion appears as a saucer-shaped radiolucent cortical irregularity without sclerotic margin at the posteromedial aspect of the distal femoral metaphysis. 

• 
MRI shows a T1 hypointense, T2 hyperintense enhancing cortically based lesion.
