Metabolic bone disease 
Multifactorial bone disease 
Osteoporosis 
• 
Osteoporosis (low bone mass) is the most common metabolic bone disease, contributing to millions of fractures per year. Osteoporosis may be secondary to numerous nutritional, endocrine, and other etiologies. 

• 
Vitamin or nutritional deficiencies can cause osteoporosis, including: 


Osteomalacia (Looser zone). Alcoholism. Hypophosphatemia. Scurvy (Wimberger sign). 
• Endocrine disturbances can impact calcium metabolism, causing osteoporosis, including: 
Hyperparathyroidism (subperiosteal resorption). Cushing disease or any increase in endogenous/exogenous steroids. 
• 
Diffuse malignancy, such as myelomatosis, can cause diffuse bony demineralization. 

• 
Genetic causes of osteoporosis include: 


Osteogenesis imperfecta. Gaucher disease. Anemia, including sickle cell and thalassemia. 
• Focal osteopenia has a more limited list of causes, including: 
Immobility/disuse. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy. Transient regional osteoporosis of the hip. 


Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) 
Overview of dual energy x-ray absorptiometry  (DEXA) 
• 
Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, universally called DEXA, is a method to quantify bone mineral density. A DEXA scan images the lumbar spine (L1–L4), and the hip. The forearm can also be imaged if either the hip or spine is not suitable (e.g., severe degenerative changes or prior surgery), or if a third point of reference is desired. 

• 
The DEXA machine provides an absolute value of bone mineral density (most useful to track 


changes over time), as well as a T-score and a Z-score. The T-score is the number of standard deviations from healthy young sex-matched patients. The Z-score is the number of standard deviations from age-matched and sex-matched patients. 
• 
In menopausal and post-menopausal females and males =50 years of age, there are 

standard definitions for normal, osteoporosis, and osteopenia, based on the T-score. Normal: T-score at or greater than –1.0. Osteopenia (low bone mass): T-score between –1.0 and –2.5. Osteoporosis: T-score at or less than –2.5. 

• 
For pre-menopausal females and males <age 50, the Z-score is used. A Z-score of –2.0 or lower is “below expected range for age” and a Z-score above –2.0 is “within the expected range for age.” 




Vitamin-deficiency bone disease 
Scurvy 
• 
Scurvy (hypovitaminosis C) causes generalized osteopenia as osteoblasts require vitamin C to form mature osteoid tissue. 

• 
Subperiosteal hemorrhage can be associated with periosteal reaction. Hemarthrosis, as well as retrobulbar and intracranial bleeding are additional manifestations. 

• 
Pediatric signs of scurvy include the Wimberger ring sign, which is increased epiphyseal sclerosis due to disorganized epiphyseal ossification, and a Pelkin’s fracture, which is a metaphyseal corner fracture. 

• 
A dense metaphyseal line (Frankel line) may be present due to provisional calcification, with underlying lucent band (Trümmerfeld zone). 



Osteomalacia 

Osteomalacia:

• 
Osteomalacia is faulty mineralization of bone matrix caused by vitamin D deficiency. The same process is called osteomalacia in adults and rickets in children. Rickets is discussed in the pediatric imaging section. 

• 
Osteomalacia manifests as diffuse osteopenia; however, a Looser zone (pseudofracture) is highly specific. A Looser zone is a cortical stress fracture that is filled with abnormal, poorly mineralized osteoid and appears as a radiolucency through the cortex. Common sites for Looser zones are the medial proximal femurs, distal scapulae, and pubic bones. 

• 
Osteomalacia may be complicated by insufficiency fracture. 




Endocrine bone disease 
Acromegaly 
• 
Acromegaly is the syndrome caused by excess growth hormone. When the growth hormone excess occurs when the physes are open, the bones will grow longitudinally, leading to gigantism. However, when the hormone excess occurs once the physes have closed then the bones cannot lengthen and instead obtain a characteristic appearance of acral (distal) growth and widening. 

• 
In the head there is enlargement of frontal sinuses, thickening of cranial bones, and an enlarged jaw. 

• 
In the hands, beak-like osteophytes of the metacarpal heads and spade-like overgrowth of the distal phalanges are characteristic. 

• 
In the feet, a characteristic finding is increased heel-pad thickness. 


Hyperparathyroidism (Recklinghausen disease of bone) 

Hyperparathyroidism: Radiograph of the hand (left image) shows subperiosteal resorption and scalloping of the radial margins of the second and third proximal and middle phalanges (arrows). Lateral skull radiograph in a different patient shows the classic salt-and-pepper appearance due to trabecular resorption. 
Cases courtesy Stacy Smith, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Hyperparathyroidism is excess parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH is normally secreted in response to hypocalcemia and maintains serum calcium levels by stimulating osteoclasts. 

• 
Primary hyperparathyroidism is autonomously increased secretion from an overactive parathyroid gland, typically due to a parathyroid adenoma. Serum calcium is high and phosphate is low. 

• 
Secondary hyperparathyroidism is increased secretion of PTH by a normal gland in response to hypocalcemia secondary to renal failure. Serum calcium is usually normal. 

• 
Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is seen after prolonged secondary hyperparathyroidism, where the parathyroid glands escape regulatory control and oversecrete PTH. 

• 
The radiological hallmarks of hyperparathyroidism are diffuse bony demineralization and subperiosteal and subligamentous bone resorption. 


Skull: The classic salt-and-pepper skull is due to trabecular resorption. 
Hands: Subperiosteal resorption of the radial aspects of the second and third middle phalanges is specific 
for hyperparathyroidism. 
Clavicle: Subperiosteal resorption of the clavicle tends to affect the acromial (distal) aspect. 
Knee: Subperiosteal bone resorption of the medial proximal tibial metaphysis. 
Teeth: Loss of lamina dura surrounding the tooth socket can occasionally be seen. 
Anywhere: Brown tumors are more common in primary hyperparathyroidism. 
Everywhere: Diffuse osteopenia results from continued osteoclast activation. 
• 
Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition (CPPD) may occur, which is more common in primary hyperparathyroidism. 

• 
Soft-tissue calcification, periosteal reaction, and sclerosis are seen more commonly in secondary hyperparathyroidism. 

• 
Complications of hyperparathyroidism include insufficiency fracture and increased propensity for ligaments and tendons to rupture.

Renal osteodystrophy 

Rugger jersey spine: Sagittal CT demonstrates symmetric endplate sclerosis at all levels of the lumbar spine in this patient with renal osteodystrophy. 
• 
Renal osteodystrophy is due to the combined effects of abnormal vitamin D metabolism (osteomalacia) and secondary hyperparathyroidism from prolonged renal failure. 

• 
In addition to renal osteodystrophy, patients with renal failure have an increased risk of additional bone disorders including osteomyelitis, avascular necrosis (if on steroids), and amyloidosis (from chronic dialysis). 

• 
Unlike osteomalacia, Looser zones are uncommon in renal osteodystrophy. 

• 
The characteristic rugger jersey spine, pictured above, describes sclerotic striping of the vertebral body endplates. 

• 
Soft-tissue and vascular calcifications are often present. 


Hypoparathyroidism 
• 
Hypoparathyroidism is most commonly a consequence of parathyroid gland resection for hyperparathyroidism. 

• 
Hypoparathyroidism causes metastatic deposition of calcium. In particular, calcium is deposited in the subcutaneous tissues and in the basal ganglia. 


Pseudohypoparathyroidism and pseudo-pseudohypoparathyroidism 
• 
Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) is due to a defect of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor. In pseudo-pseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP), the PTH level is normal and PTH receptor is normal, but the patient’s phenotype is indistinguishable from that of pseudohypoparathyroidism. 

• 
Both entities clinically present with obesity, round facies, short stature, and brachydactyly (short fingers). 

• 
The classic radiographic finding is a short metacarpal, usually the fourth or fifth. 



Pseudohypoparathyroidism: Radiograph of the hand shows a markedly shortened fourth metacarpal (arrow). 
In addition to pseudohypoparathyroidism and pseudo-pseudohypoparathyroidism, an additional differential consideration for a short fourth metacarpal includes Turner syndrome. 

Hypothyroidism 
• 
In children, hypothyroidism causes a delay in skeletal and dental maturity. 

• 
Hypothyroidism may cause bullet-shaped vertebral bodies and Wormian bones in the skull. 

• 
Hypothyroidism is associated with slipped capital femoral epiphysis. 



Hyperthyroidism 
• Hyperthyroidism causes accelerated bony maturation in children. Thyroid acropachy is a rare cause of diaphyseal periosteal reaction of multiple bones including the metacarpals, metatarsals, and phalanges, seen in the setting of treated hyperthyroidism. 


Idiopathic bone disease 
Paget disease 
• 
Paget disease is a progressive disturbance of osteoclastic and osteoblastic regulation seen in older adults. The cause of Paget disease is unknown, but paramyxovirus may be involved. 

• 
Symptoms of Paget disease include bone pain, osseous enlargement or bowing, compression of cranial nerves, and high output cardiac failure. Weakened subchondral bone commonly leads to osteoarthritis. Other complications of Paget disease include pathologic fracture and malignant degeneration (most commonly osteosarcoma). 

• 
Paget disease affects the skull, spine, and pelvis most commonly, followed by the articular ends of the femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus. Involvement of the ribs and scapula can occur but is uncommon. 

• 
Three sequential phases are described, although there is often overlap between the phases and the disease may not always progress through the three stages in order. 


Phase I: Osteolytic phase is due to hyperactivated osteoclasts and resultant active bone resorption. Phase II: Mixed lytic and sclerotic phase is continued bony resorption and new bone formation. Phase III: Sclerotic phase is dominated by increased bone density and sclerosis. 
• 
Chronic Paget disease shows thickening of cortex, coarse irregular trabecular pattern, and expansion of bone. This appearance has been called a caricature of normal bone. 

• 
Paget of the skull: In the osteolytic phase (phase I), the typical appearance is a sharply marginated geographic lytic region called osteoporosis circumscripta. In the mixed phase (phase II), the classic appearance is the cotton wool skull which looks like an artist dabbed paint on the skull with a piece of cotton. 



Cotton wool skull in mixed-phase Paget disease: 
There are cloud-like regions of patchy sclerosis throughout the calvarium. 
Note the thickened calvarial cortex, which is a generalized feature of Paget disease. 
• Paget of the vertebral bodies: The mixed phase (phase II) can produce either the classic picture frame vertebral body (with increased density of the periphery of the vertebral body, as opposed to the rugger jersey spine of renal osteodystrophy, which features sclerosis of just the superior and inferior endplates) or an ivory (diffusely sclerotic) vertebral body. 

Picture frame vertebral body in mixed-phase Paget disease: 
There is cortical thickening of the periphery of the entire L2 (and to a lesser extent L1) vertebral body. 
• Paget of the pelvis: When Paget disease involves the pelvis, the typical appearance is asymmetric coarsened trabecular thickening, with thickening of the iliopectineal and ilioischial lines. Acetabular protrusio may result. 

Paget disease of the pelvis: 
There is asymmetric cortical and trabecular thickening and coarsening predominantly involving the left ischium (arrow). 
Note the thickening of the iliopectineal line (IP). 
• Paget of the long bones: The lytic phase (phase I) progresses from the proximal articular end of bone into the diaphysis with a sharply marginated border. This border has been called the blade of grass or flame-shaped margin and allows differentiation from a neoplasm. As Paget disease progresses through its phases, it may cause bowing of the long bones and coxa vara deformity of the proximal femur. 

Blade of grass appearance of the lytic phase of Paget disease, as it progresses from proximal to distal: 
Frontal and lateral radiographs of the femur demonstrate a “flame-shaped” margin (arrows) of a lytic lesion progressing distally. 

Hereditary hyperphosphatasia (juvenile Paget) 
• 
Hereditary hyperphosphatasia, also called juvenile Paget disease, is an autosomal recessive disease of infants and young children. There is cortical thickening, trabecular thickening, osteopenia, and bowing of all bones in the body, resulting in severe deformity. 

• 
Aside from the young age of the patients and diffuse involvement, the radiography of juvenile Paget otherwise appears very similar to adult Paget disease. There may be sparing of the articular ends of bones (epiphyseal sparing) in juvenile Paget disease. 


Osteopetrosis 


• 
Osteopetrosis is an extremely rare deficiency of osteoclastic carbonic anhydrase, which leads to inability of osteoclasts to resorb bone. 

• 
Osteopetrosis is characterized by diffuse, marked sclerosis of the entire skeleton. The bones are extremely brittle, which typically leads to multiple fractures. 

• 
The vertebral bodies may have a sandwich or rugger jersey appearance similar to renal osteodystrophy, but diffuse bony sclerosis is more marked in osteopetrosis. 



Gaucher disease 
• 
Gaucher disease is caused by an autosomal recessive defect in glucocerebrosidase, leading to abnormal cerebroside deposition in altered macrophages called Gaucher cells. Gaucher cells cause bone infarctions, medullary expansion, and hepatosplenomegaly. 

• 
The classic Erlenmeyer flask deformity of long bones is a result of abnormal modeling. 

• 
Characteristic H-shaped vertebral bodies are due to endplate avascular necrosis. H-shaped vertebral bodies are not specific to Gaucher disease, which can be seen more commonly in 


sickle cell disease. The size of the spleen can differentiate between sickle cell and Gaucher disease: Sickle cell causes splenic auto-infarction, while patients with Gaucher disease have splenomegaly. 


Hematologic bone disease 
Sickle cell disease 
• 
Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive defect in the beta-chain of hemoglobin. Red cells are sickle-shaped and cause microvascular occlusion. The three osseous manifestations of sickle cell disease are bone infarcts, dramatically increased risk of osteomyelitis, and marrow expansion/hyperplasia. 

• 
Sickle cell bone infarcts: Infarcts and avascular necrosis are caused by microvascular occlusion from the sickled red cells. Avascular necrosis of vertebral body endplates causes the characteristic H-shaped or Lincoln-log vertebral bodies. Other common locations for infarction include the femoral heads and the diaphyses and metaphyses of long bones. 



H-shaped vertebral bodies: 
Lateral thoracic spine 
radiograph shows characteristic central endplate depressions of the vertebral bodies (arrows) representing vertebral body avascular necrosis. 
• 
In advanced sickle cell, patchy sclerosis from multiple bone infarctions may become nearly confluent, producing diffusely sclerotic bones. 

• 
Sickle cell dactylitis (also called hand-foot syndrome) is a special consideration in very young children who have persistent hematopoietic marrow in the digits of the hands and feet. Microvascular occlusion exacerbated by cold temperature causes dactylitis, which is evident on radiographs as soft-tissue swelling and periosteal reaction. 

• 
Sickle cell osteomyelitis: Patients with sickle cell have an approximately 100x increased risk of osteomyelitis, most frequently with Salmonella species. 


• Sickle cell marrow expansion: The radiographic findings of marrow expansion are more pronounced in thalassemia, but similar findings can be seen in sickle cell. MRI of the bone marrow shows diffusely low signal on T1-weighted images, reflecting diffuse red (cellular) marrow. In the long bones, chronic stimulation of red cell production causes widening of the medullary spaces and 
coarsening of the trabeculae, which results in osteopenia and increased risk of insufficiency fracture. In the skull, marrow expansion can cause hair-on-end striations and widening of the medullary cavity. Involvement of the facial bones and extramedullary hematopoiesis are seen more commonly in 
thalassemia. 
Bilateral femoral head avascular necrosis: Frontal pelvic radiograph in a skeletally immature patient with sickle cell anemia shows marked flattening and sclerosis of both femoral heads (arrows), representing advanced (Ficat stage IV) avascular necrosis. 
The Ficat staging of avascular necrosis is subsequently discussed. 

Thalassemia 
• 
Thalassemia is an autosomal recessive congenital anemia that is caused by a defect in the alpha or beta hemoglobin subunits. 

• 
Similar to sickle cell disease, the osseous hallmarks of thalassemia are bone infarcts, marrow hyperplasia, and infection. However, in contrast to sickle cell, the marrow expansion is much more prominent as the anemia can be more severe. 

• 
In the hand, marrow expansion can cause widening and squaring of the phalanges and metacarpals. 

• 
In the skull, the hair-on-end striations are a classic manifestation of marrow expansion. 

• 
In the facial bones, marrow expansion may obliterate the paranasal sinuses, causing the typical rodent-like facies. 

• 
In the long bones, the marrow expansion may cause an Erlenmeyer flask deformity. 


Myelofi brosis 

Myelofibrosis: Coronal CT in soft-tissue (left image) and bone windows show splenomegaly (arrows) and diffusely dense bones. 
• Myelofibrosis is progressive fibrosis of bone marrow in older patients, leading to anemia and splenomegaly. Bone marrow fibrosis leads to diffusely sclerotic bones. 
Mastocytosis 
• Mastocytosis is abnormal proliferation of mast cells. It may result in either diffuse or patchy sclerosis from the reaction of the marrow to the infiltrating mast cells. 

Two patients with mastocytosis: Coronal CT images in two different patients demonstrate the variable imaging appearance of mastocytosis. The left image shows a diffusely sclerotic appearance of the bones and the right image shows patchy sclerosis.
