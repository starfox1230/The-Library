Soft tissue tumors 
Lipomatous neoplasms 
Lipoma 

Coronal T1-weighted MRI Axial PD-weighted MRI 

Axial STIR MRI Axial post-contrast T1-weighted MRI with fat suppression 
Lipoma: There is a lobulated mass (yellow arrows) in the posterior/dorsal aspect of the forearm, which follows fat signal intensity on T1-weighted and PD-weighted images (note that the PD sequence alone cannot be used to determine if something is fat signal intensity as both fat and fluid are hyperintense on PD-weighted images). The mass saturates out on the T1-weighted image with fat saturation. There is minimal septational enhancement (red arrow), and slightly increased signal intensity on the STIR sequence (blue arrows), but no thickened septations or nodular enhancement. 
• 
Lipoma, a benign proliferation of adipocytes, is the most common soft-tissue tumor, and the most common explanation for a palpable mass. However, it is important to note that not all palpable masses are lipomas and imaging should be performed before presuming a diagnosis of lipoma and certainly before resection. 

• 
A substantial minority of lipomas may contain some nonadipose tissue. Minimal nonadipose tissue, such as wispy septations, is commonly seen in lipomas. However, thickened or irregular septations, or nodular enhancing foci would not be consistent with a simple lipoma, and would suggest a well-differentiated liposarcoma/atypical lipomatous tumor. 


• Lipomas confirmed by imaging are usually not resected or biopsied unless there are atypical elements on imaging, or patients are symptomatic due to mass effect. MSK: 961 
Well-differentiated liposarcoma/atypical lipomatous tumor (ALT) 

Axial T1-weighted MRI Axial post-contrast T1-weighted MRI with fat suppression 

Axial T2-weighted MRI with fat suppression Ultrasound-guided biospy 
Well-differentiated liposarcoma/atypical lipomatous tumor:  Axial T1-weighted image demonstrates a relatively small oval mass (yellow arrows) in the subcutaneous tissues of the lateral distal thigh (just above the knee), largely fat signal intensity but containing heterogeneous signal. 
There is heterogeneous enhancement within the mass (red arrows), and the fluid sensitive fat suppressed T2-weighted image shows multifocal regions of high signal (blue arrow). Based on the complex features (enhancement, and increased signal intensity on fluid sensitive images), biopsy was performed, which demonstrated ALT. Note the circumscribed, slightly echogenic appearance of the mass on ultrasound, which is a typical appearance for lipoma or ALT. 
• 
Well-differentiated liposarcoma, also called atypical lipomatous tumor (ALT), is a low-grade adipocytic neoplasm that rarely metastasizes but can be locally aggressive. 

• 
While there can be some overlap in the imaging appearance of ALT and benign lipoma, features of ALT include larger size (however, size alone cannot be used to distinguish lipoma from ALT), thickened septae, septal or nodular contrast enhancement, or increased signal intensity on fluid sensitive sequences. 


High-grade liposarcoma 
• 
Both pleomorphic liposarcoma and dedifferentiated liposarcoma cannot usually be differentiated by imaging, and thus they can reasonably be considered together as “high­grade liposarcoma.” 

• 
Imaging typically shows a large mass with heterogeneous enhancement and usually central necrosis. Fatty elements may or may not be present depending on the degree of differentiation. 


High-grade liposarcoma (continued) 

Coronal T1-weighted MRI Sagittal STIR MRI Post-contrast T1 MRI with fat 
suppression Dedifferentiated liposarcoma: There is a dominant, heterogeneously enhancing mass (yellow arrows) with central necrosis (central nonenhancement; red arrow) in the left medial thigh. Note the absence of any fatty elements on the T1-weighted image. This appearance can be seen in pleomorphic or dedifferentiated liposarcoma, as well as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, or leiomyosarcoma. 

Coronal T1-weighted MRI Axial post-contrast T1-weighted MRI with fat suppression 
Myxoid liposarcoma: There is a T2-hyperintense mass (yellow arrows) in the right groin, with whorl-like internal architecture. There are wispy lipomatous elements (red arrow) evident on the coronal T1-weighted MR. The mass enhances heterogeneously. The differential diagnosis for an aggressive or large T2 hyperintense enhancing mass includes myxoid liposarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, or malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. 
• Myxoid liposarcoma is a high-grade neoplasm that has a unique appearance compared to other adipocytic neoplasms. Specifically its myxoid content creates a relatively homogeneous hyperintense appearance on T2-weighted imaging. Similar to high-grade liposarcoma, fatty elements may not be apparent on imaging. 
Fibrolipomatous hamartoma of nerve 



Macrodystrophia lipomatosa with fibrolipomatous hamartoma of the median nerve: 
Frontal radiograph of the hand shows broadened phalanges of the index finger with extensive proliferative changes (yellow arrows), and soft tissue overgrowth. There is also partially imaged proliferative change of the thumb metacarpal. 
Axial fluid-sensitive MRI demonstrates marked expansion of the median nerve (red arrows), with volar bowing of the flexor retinaculum. There is extensive fatty proliferation throughout the thenar soft tissues (blue arrow). 
Coronal T1-weighted MRI demonstrates pathognomonic cable-like appearance of the median nerve (red arrows) with fat signal intensity interdigitating between the fascicles. 
• 
Fibrolipomatous hamartoma is a rare benign neoplasm of peripheral nerves, where fibroadipose tissue proliferates and infiltrates the epineurium and perineurium. 

• 
The median nerve of the wrist is a common site for fibrolipomatous hamartoma. 

• 
Although rare, imaging features are pathognomonic, with a cable-like appearance of the nerve due to fatty proliferation interposed between the fascicles. 

• 
Fibrolipomatous hamartoma is associated with macrodystrophia lipomatosa, which is a rare congenital localized gigantism (such as involvement of a single finger) caused by overgrowth of fibroadipose tissue. 



High-grade sarcoma 
Overview of high-grade non-adipocytic sarcoma 
• These neoplasms are not reliably distinguishable from each other on imaging (perhaps except for myxofibrosarcoma, which is T2 hyperintense). They are high-grade tumors that frequently metastasize and are usually large at presentation. 
Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) 

Sagittal T2-weighted MRI with fat suppression Post-contrast coronal T1-weighted MRI with fat suppression 
Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS): There is a dominant mass in the right anterior thigh with heterogeneous enhancement and central necrosis. This appearance can be seen in UPS, rhabdomyosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, as well as pleomorphic or dedifferentiated liposarcoma. 
• 
Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) is a high-grade sarcoma that has been historically called malignant fibrous histiosarcoma. 

• 
Imaging shows a large mass with heterogeneous enhancement, often with central necrosis. There is large imaging overlap between UPS and other high-grade soft tissue tumors. 


Rhabdomyosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma 
• 
Rhabdomyosarcoma is a high-grade tumor from skeletal muscle origin. 

• 
Leiomyosarcoma is a high-grade tumor from smooth muscle origin. 

• 
Both appear as large aggressive soft tissue masses, without specific imaging features. 


Myxofibrosarcoma 

Axial T2-weighted MRI with fat suppression Post-contrast axial T1-weighted MRI with fat suppression 
Myxofibrosarcoma: There is a large, heterogeneous, predominantly T2 hyperintense mass (yellow arrows) in the medial right proximal thigh, with heterogeneous enhancement including focal nodular enhancement medially (red arrow). 
• Myxofibrosarcoma is a high-grade tumor with myxoid and fibrous elements. The myxoid components give these lesions a characteristic hyperintense appearance on T2-weighted images. 


Fibrous neoplastic and non-neoplastic masses 
Superficial fibromatosis 

Coronal STIR MRI Post-contrast coronal T1-weighted MRI with fat suppression 
Plantar fibromatosis (Ledderhose disease): Coronal MR images through the foot demonstrate an intermediate signal intensity enhancing subcutaneous nodular mass (arrows) along the plantar aponeurosis. 
• 
Superficial fibromatoses include both palmar fibromatosis (involving the hand/fingers) and plantar fibromatosis (involving the foot). 

• 
On MR, fibromatosis appears as nodular foci of various signal intensity. Although fibrous in etiology, the masses are not necessarily low signal, and lesions with increased cellularity may show more prominent enhancement. 

• 
Palmar fibromatosis, also called Dupuytren disease or Dupuytren contracture, is more common, and presents with painless subcutaneous nodules of the palmar surface of the hand. Treatment of symptomatic palmar fibromatosis is typically surgical. 

• 
Plantar fibromatosis, also called Ledderhose disease, is less common than palmar fibromatosis and typically occurs in younger patients. In contrast to palmar fibromatosis, treatment of plantar fibromatosis is typically conservative in most cases, with footwear modification or intralesional steroid injections. 


Nodular fasciitis 

Axial T2-weighted MRI with fat suppression Post-contrast axial T1-weighted MRI with fat suppression 
Nodular fasciitis: There is a T2 hyperintense enhancing mass (arrows) in the medial upper arm, located within the medial head of the triceps muscle. This was biopsied, with pathology of nodular fasciitis. 
• 
Nodular fasciitis is a benign but rapidly growing non-neoplastic lesion that may mimic sarcoma clinically and on imaging. Masses may be subcutaneous or deep in location. Masses are typically T2 hyperintense and some pathologists consider these lesions to be myxoid. 

• 
Although benign, they appear as an enhancing mass and biopsy is usually performed. 


Elastofibroma dorsi 

Axial post-contrast CT Coronal post-contrast CT 
Elastofibroma dorsi: There is a crescentic-shaped mass (yellow arrows) located deep to latissimus dorsi (LD). The mass features alternating striations of fatty tissue. The coronal image best demonstrates infrascapular location and asymmetry when compared to the normal left side. 
• 
Elastofibroma dorsi (EFD) is a rare, benign mass that characteristically arises in the subscapular region, more commonly on the right, typically in middle-aged females. 

• 
EFD is thought to represent a reactive pseudotumor due to mechanical irrigation. 

• 
On imaging, EFD demonstrates alternating bands of fibrous and fatty tissue in a crescentic­shaped mass located deep to latissimus dorsi in the infrascapular region. 


Desmoid fibromatosis 

Axial PD-weighted MR Post-contrast axial T1-weighted MR 
Desmoid fibromatosis: There are multiple geographic low-signal intensity interfascial lesions about the left hip (arrows), with patchy enhancement. 
• 
Desmoid fibromatosis is a benign but locally aggressive neoplasm, with the abdominal wall the most common location. Masses are low in signal intensity and enhance variably. 

• 
Gardner syndrome is a colonic polyposis syndrome associated with desmoid fibromatosis. 


Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans 

Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP): Post-contrast axial subtraction T1-weighted MRI demonstrates lobulated cutaneous enhancement (yellow arrows) of the right anterior abdominal wall. 
• 
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a slowly growing, intermediate-grade cutaneous malignancy that presents as a superficial skin nodule or mass. 

• 
On MR, the lesion is hyperintense on T2-weighted images and enhances. MSK: 967 




Nerve sheath tumors 
Schwannoma and neurofibroma 

Axial PD-weighted MRI Coronal STIR MRI 

Axial T1-weighted MRI Axial post-contrast T1-weighted MRI with fat suppression 
Schwannoma: There is a circumscribed T2 hyperintense round mass (yellow arrows) in the popliteal fossa, which enhances homogeneously. Note the eccentric position of the tibial nerve (red arrow), which is splayed around the mass, likely contributing the culprit nerve fibers from which the mass arises. 
• Schwannomas and neurofibromas are both peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) and together comprise 10% of benign soft tissue tumors. These two entities are usually difficult to differentiate from each other on imaging, and in forming a differential diagnosis it is usually reasonable to state “peripheral nerve sheath tumor.” 
Occasionally, it is possible to distinguish between a schwannoma and neurofibroma on MR imaging based on the relation of the lesion to the nerve: A schwannoma may be eccentric to (and separatable from) the nerve, while a neurofibroma is fusiform mass-like expansion of the nerve, which courses through the center of the lesion. 
• 
PNSTs typically appear as fusiform, circumscribed masses, characteristically hyperintense on T2-weighted images and avidly enhancing. 

• 
The split fat pad sign may be seen with a peripheral triangle of preserved fat at the proximal and distal margins of the mass. The target sign can be seen in both PNSTs (although more common in neurofibromas), which is a central region of low signal intensity on T2-weighted images. 


Note that these signs are not specific for benign PNSTs, and can also be seen in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). Please see the next page for an example of these signs in an MPNST. 
• PNSTs may appear along the course of major nerves; however, they can appear virtually anywhere if they arise from a small unnamed nerve. 
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor 

Post-contrast axial T1-weighted MRI with fat suppression Axial STIR MRI 

Coronal T1-weighted MRI Sagittal STIR 
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), arising from a neurofibroma in a patient with 
neurofibromatosis type I: There is a large, enhancing, T2-hyperintense mass in the posterior calf (yellow arrows). The mass arises from the tibial nerve, which courses through the center of the mass (red arrows). 
A central region of low signal intensity on the axial STIR image represents the target sign (blue arrow). A triangle of preserved fat seen on the coronal T1-weighted image represents the split fat sign (green arrow). In this case, the relatively large size of the mass and the patient’s history of neurofibromatosis type I should 
raise concern for MPNST. 
• 
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is highly associated with neurofibromatosis type I (in 50% of cases). 

• 
MPNSTs cannot be reliably differentiated from benign PNSTs on imaging. The previously discussed imaging signs suggesting a neurogenic tumor, including the target sign and the split fat sign, may be present. However, imaging features favoring malignancy include larger size, ill-defined margins, central necrosis, and rapid growth. 

• 
Any new or enlarging mass in a patient with neurofibromatosis type I should raise concern for development of MPNST. PET-CT is an excellent modality to determine need for biopsy. 



Additional tumors 
Myxoma 

Axial STIR MRI Post-contrast axial T1-weighted MRI with fat suppression 
Myxoma: There is a homogeneously hyperintense, near fluid signal intensity intra-muscular mass (yellow arrows) located vastus medialis. The mass demonstrates faint wispy enhancement (red arrow). 
• 
A myxoma is a benign soft tissue tumor. The myxoid extracellular matrix creates a near fluid-signal intensity appearance, with minimal enhancement. They tend to occur in muscles. 

• 
Mazabraud syndrome is fibrous dysplasia with intramuscular myxomas. 


Synovial sarcoma 

Axial T2-weighted MRI with fat suppression Post-contrast T1-weighted MRI with fat 
suppression 
Synovial sarcoma: There is a T2 hyperintense, enhancing mass (yellow arrows) at the volar/ulnar aspect of the wrist, interposed between the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) and flexor digitorum profundus (FDP).  Note that although the mass is near fluid signal intensity on the fluid sensitive sequence, there is still some internal complexity with whorl-like regions of low signal (red arrow). 
The differential of a small, T2 hyperintense, enhancing, circumscribed mass would also include nerve sheath tumor. 
• 
Synovial sarcoma is a high-grade mesenchymal tumor typically occurring in adolescents and young adults. 

• 
The term synovial in its name is highly misleading, as this tumor has nothing to do with synovial tissue or joints. However, it does have a propensity to occur in the vicinity of joints, and the term likely arrived from pathologic confusion in the early twentieth century. 

• 
Synovial sarcoma is relatively homogeneously hyperintense on T2-weighted images, usually isointense to fluid. The classic teaching is that a fluid signal intensity mass in a younger patient that does not communicate with a joint could be synovial sarcoma and contrast should be administered. In practice, however, these lesions are usually somewhat more complex than simple fluid and windowing of the images can make the internal complexity more conspicuous. 


Morton neuroma 

Morton neuroma: Coronal post-contrast T1-weighted MRI with fat suppression demonstrates a dumbbell-shaped enhancing mass (arrows) in the second interspace, which is slightly eccentrically plantar in location. 

Transverse ultrasound image through the plantar aspect of the metatarsal heads (the top of the image is plantar) demonstrates a hypoechoic mass (arrows) at the plantar aspect of the second interspace. 
• 
Morton neuromas are non-neoplastic benign masses that occur due to degeneration and fibrosis around a plantar digital nerve of the foot, most commonly occurring at the level of the metatarsal heads in the second or third interspaces. Of note, a Morton “neuroma” is not a true neuroma, as a neuroma is due to proliferation of nerve tissue (either neoplastic or in response to amputation), rather than perineural fibrous tissue. 

• 
Clinically, Morton neuroma produces burning pain, more commonly in females, and in the proper clinical context biopsy is usually not needed. 

• 
MRI or ultrasound are both excellent imaging modalities for assessment of Morton neuroma. On MR, Morton neuroma appears as a dumbbell- or teardrop-shaped low signal (on T2-weighted images) mass with variable enhancement. Intravenous gadolinium is very helpful to increase conspicuity of the mass. While the mass may extend dorsally in some cases, they are typically predominantly inter-metatarsal and plantar in location. 

• 
On ultrasound, Morton neuroma is a hypoechoic mass in the intermetatarsal space, best seen with a high resolution probe from a plantar approach with the patient prone. 

• 
Intermetatarsal bursitis is frequently associated with Morton neuroma, and on ultrasound the apparent mass may reflect a combination of Morton neuroma and associated bursitis. 

• 
Treatment is usually conservative, with modification of footwear and steroid injection.
