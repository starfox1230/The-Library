Shoulder 
Bony anatomy of the shoulder 


Acromioclavicular joint 
Acromioclavicular (AC) joint separation 

Grade III acromioclavicular injury: 
Frontal radiograph of the right shoulder shows superior elevation of the clavicle at the AC joint, in keeping with acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligament tears. 
• 
Injuries to the acromioclavicular (AC) joint typically occur in young athletic adults, most commonly from a downward blow to the lateral shoulder. AC joint injuries range from an AC ligament sprain (grade I) to complete disruption of the AC joint capsule and associated coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments (grades III–VI). 

• 
The normal AC joint space should be <5 mm and the normal CC distance is <11–13 mm, with a wide range of normal variation. An asymmetry of >50% side-to-side is abnormal. Passive traction, with the patient holding a weight, may be necessary to unmask an injury. 

• 
Displacement of the acromion and clavicle determines AC ligament integrity, while the coracoclavicular interspace is assessed to evaluate the CC ligaments. 

• 
Grade I: AC ligament sprain. Radiographs are normal. 

• 
Grade II: Disruption of the AC ligament with intact CC ligaments. 

• 
Grade III: AC joint and CC ligamentous disruption. CC interspace is widened 25–100% relative to the contralateral side. 

• 
Grade IV: Distal clavicle displaced posteriorly into trapezius (seen on CT or axillary view). 

• 
Grade V: Severe grade III injury, with >100% displacement relative to the other side. 

• 
Grade VI: Inferior dislocation of the distal clavicle. 



Shoulder bursae/recesses 
• The subacromial and subdeltoid bursae normally communicate with each other. 
subdeltoid 
This combined subacromial/subdeltoid 
bursa
bursa is not normally in communication with the glenohumeral joint. 
• 
Fluid injected into the glenohumeral joint that extends into the subacromial/ subdeltoid bursa is seen with a complete rotator cuff tear. A gap in the rotator cuff will almost always be evident. 

• 
The subcoracoid bursa is located between the subscapularis muscle and the coracoid process, whereas the subscapular bursa is located between the anterior surface of the scapula and the subscapularis muscle 

• 
The axillary pouch has a U-shaped appearance banded by the inferior glenohumeral ligament.

• 
Impingement syndrome is a clinical diagnosis that can have a variety of causes and MRI findings. Shoulder impingement was originally described as chronic compression/irritation of the structures that pass through the coracoacromial arch, including the supraspinatus tendon, biceps tendon, and subacromial bursa. 

• 
Rotator cuff tears are often associated with chronic impingement, although there is controversy whether the cuff tears are a result of chronic mechanical impingement or whether degeneration leads to cuff tears, resulting in impingement syndrome. 

• 
Extrinsic impingement is caused by structural abnormalities external to the joint and is divided into primary and subcoracoid impingement. Primary external impingement is common and is due to a variation in the anatomy of the coracoacromial arch (e.g., subacromial enthesophyte, hooked acromion, AC joint osteophytes, os acromiale, or thickened coracoacromial ligament). Primary external impingement is typically seen in young athletes involved with throwing or repetitive overhead movement. Chronic primary external impingement may cause the supraspinatus tendon and/or the proximal aspect of the long head of the biceps tendon to become 


degenerated, partially torn, or even completely torn. The subacromial bursa, immediately inferior to the acromion, may become inflamed, leading to subacromial/subdeltoid bursitis. Subcoracoid impingement is less common and occurs when the coracohumeral distance narrows. 
• Intrinsic impingement is related to glenohumeral instability and is caused by abnormalities of the rotator cuff and joint capsule, without abnormality of the coracoacromial arch. 
Acromial shape and orientation 

• 
The impact of acromial shape on impingement syndrome is controversial. An acromion with a hooked undersurface (type III) or convex undersurface (type IV) may contribute to impingement (primary external type) and lead to subsequent rotator cuff tears. 

• 
Friction of the acromion against the immediately underlying supraspinatus and biceps tendons may predispose to injury from impingement. 


Os acromiale 
• 
An os acromiale is a persistent accessory ossification center of the acromion seen in up to 15% of patients. It is best evaluated on the axial images. 

• 
Although the presence of an os acromiale may be an asymptomatic normal variant, the presence of marrow edema suggests that the os may be a cause of pain. 

• 
Treatment is resection or fusion. 





Rotator cuff 
Anatomy of the rotator cuff 

• 
The rotator cuff is an active stabilizer of the glenohumeral joint and is formed by the 4 rotator cuff muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis) and their tendons. 

• 
The supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor are located posterior to the body of the scapula and insert on the greater tuberosity. The subscapularis is anterior to the scapula and inserts on the lesser tuberosity. 


MSK: 1047 

Tendinosis/tendinopathy 
• 
Tendinosis (also called tendinopathy) is mucoid degeneration of the tendon, without active inflammation. 

• 
In the shoulder, tendinopathy of the rotator cuff is common. The normal lamellar structure of the rotator cuff tendon is lost, and the tendon appears expansile and intermediate in signal intensity. 


Overview of rotator cuff tears 
• 
Tears of the rotator cuff can be partial or complete. 

• 
Complete rotator cuff tears allow communication between the subacromial/subdeltoid bursa and the glenohumeral joint. 

• 
The footprint is the attachment of the tendons at the greater tuberosity. The critical zone is a potentially undervascularized portion of the distal supraspinatus tendon approximately 1 cm proximal to the insertion on the footprint. Relatively decreased vascular supply may predispose to rupture in this location. 


Partial-thickness rotator cuff tear

Case courtesy Kirstin M. Small, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
The most commonly injured rotator cuff muscle is the supraspinatus, followed by the infraspinatus. The teres minor is the least commonly injured rotator cuff muscle. 

• 
A partial-thickness tear features abnormal signal in a portion of the muscle or tendon but not extending through its entire thickness. MR arthrography will not show communication between the injected glenohumeral joint and the subacromial/subdeltoid bursa. 


Partial-thickness tears can be challenging to diagnose without MR arthrography. Reparative granulation tissue can obscure the abnormal signal that would otherwise indicate a tear. 
• 
Partial tears can be divided into bursal-surface, articular-surface, or intrasubstance tears. Articular-surface tears are by far the most common type of partial tear. 

• 
A rim rent tear is the most common type of partial tear. Also called the PASTA lesion (partial thickness articular supraspinatus tendon avulsion), the rim rent tear is an avulsion­type partial tear of the articular surface of the supraspinatus as it inserts on the greater tuberosity. 


Less commonly, an analogous lesion can be seen in the infraspinatus. 
• The PAINT (partial articular tear with intratendinous extension) lesion is a partial rotator cuff tear at the articular surface that also extends into the tendon. 
Full-thickness rotator cuff tear 

Full-thickness rotator cuff tear: Coronal proton-density (left image) and sagittal fat-saturated proton-density (right image) conventional MRI demonstrates complete discontinuity of the supraspinatus tendon with the tendon retracted proximally (yellow arrow). There is a large effusion, demonstrating continuity of the glenohumeral joint and the subacromial/subdeltoid bursa (red arrows). Susceptibility artifact is present in the humeral head, consistent with prior rotator cuff repair. 
Case courtesy Kirstin M. Small, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
A full-thickness rotator cuff tear is seen on MR arthrography when fluid injected into the glenohumeral joint extends into the subacromial/subdeltoid bursa. In the absence of injected gadolinium, a full-thickness tear can be diagnosed if abnormal signal extends through the fibers of the tendon. A gap in the tendon is almost always present. 

• 
Similar to partial tears, the supraspinatus is most commonly torn. 

• 
Approximately 30–40% of supraspinatus tears are also associated with a tear of the infraspinatus. 


The infraspinatus is rarely torn in isolation; however isolated infraspinatus tears can be seen in the setting of posterior instability. The posterior capsule and labrum should be carefully evaluated in such cases. 
• 
A chronic full-thickness rotator cuff tear due to rheumatoid arthritis has a classic imaging appearance. The humeral head migrates superiorly and may articulate with the acromion in severe cases. 

• 
Full-thickness rotator cuff tears are classified by the length of the affected tendon/muscle, ranging from small (<1 cm) to massive (>5 cm). 


Rotator cuff atrophy 
• 
Atrophy of the rotator cuff is most commonly due to chronic rotator cuff tear. Fatty degeneration may occur within 4 weeks of injury and is usually irreversible. The extent of muscle degeneration correlates with outcome following surgical repair. The degree of fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff muscles should be routinely assessed in the sagittal plane. The degree of fatty replacement can be graded with the Goutallier classification: 

• 
Less commonly, rotator cuff atrophy may be secondary to denervation atrophy, subsequently discussed. Denervation atrophy is usually associated with a paralabral cyst. 


Grade 0: Normal muscle, no fat.  Grade 3: Fatty infiltration, equal muscle and fat.  
Grade 1: Muscle contains a few fatty streaks.  Grade 4: Fatty infiltration, more fat than muscle.  
Grade 2: Fatty infiltration, more muscle than fat.

Shoulder ligaments and rotator interval 
Anatomy of the shoulder ligaments 

• 
The rotator interval is a triangular region that allows rotational motion around the coracoid process. It is located between the supraspinatus and subscapularis tendons. The rotator interval contains the coracohumeral ligament (CHL), the long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT), and the superior glenohumeral ligament (SGHL). 

• 
The CHL connects the lateral aspect of the coracoid process to the greater tubercle of the humerus, where the CHL blends with the supraspinatus tendon. The CHL helps to stabilize the intra-articular biceps tendon together with the superior glenohumeral ligament as the biceps pulley. The CHL is located external to the joint capsule. 

• 
The glenohumeral ligaments (SGHL, MGHL, and IGHL) are derived from the labrum and form a portion of the joint capsule. 

• 
The superior glenohumeral ligament (SGHL) connects the lesser tuberosity to the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula. 

• 
The middle glenohumeral ligament (MGHL) also connects the lesser tuberosity to the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula. The MGHL is congenitally absent in up to 1/3 of patients. Tears of the MGHL are associated with SLAP lesions. 


• The inferior glenohumeral ligament (IGHL) connects the anatomic neck of the humerus to the inferior glenoid labrum. The IGHL is by far the most important component of the capsulolabral complex for maintaining stability in abduction and external rotation. The IGHL contains three components (the anterior band, the axillary pouch, and the posterior band), all of which are well-seen on sagittal MR: The anterior band of the IGHL provides anterior stability. There are several lesions of the anterior band of the IGHL that are associated with anterior instability, discussed on the following page. 
The IGHL forms the axillary pouch of the glenohumeral joint capsule. The posterior band contributes to posterior stability. The IGHL is the only glenohumeral ligament to have a posterior component. 
• The long head biceps tendon (LHBT) attaches to the anterosuperior glenoid rim along with the SGHL and MGHL. 
Adhesive capsulitis 

Coronal PD-weighted MRI with fat suppression Coronal post-contrast T1-weighted MRI with fat supp. 
Adhesive capsulitis: 
There is thickening and enhancement of the inferior glenohumeral ligament (yellow arrows), and effacement of fat in the rotator interval (red arrows). 
Coracohumeral ligament (blue arrow) is not well seen due to fat effacing the rotator interval, but this ligament is also typically thickened in adhesive capsulitis. 
• 
Adhesive capsulitis, clinically known as frozen shoulder, is thickening and contraction of the glenohumeral joint capsule due to inflammation of the joint capsule and synovium. This results in pain and loss of range of motion. 

• 
Adhesive capsulitis is primarily a clinical diagnosis, but MRI findings include thickening, edema, and enhancement of the joint capsule (inferior glenohumeral ligament >4 mm), effacement of fat in the rotator interval, and thickening of the coracohumeral ligament. 

• 
Radiographs are often normal but are helpful to exclude other causes of pain, such as glenohumeral osteoarthritis or calcific tendinopathy. 




Biceps tendon 
Anatomy of the biceps tendon 
• 
The long head of the biceps tendon originates at the superior labrum and courses in the intertubercular groove. The biceps tendon sheath communicates with the glenohumeral joint. Fluid in the tendon sheath may be normal. 

• 
The biceps pulley is a capsuloligamentous complex that stabilizes the biceps tendon in a sling within the bicipital groove. The biceps pulley is formed by the superior glenohumeral ligament, coracohumeral ligament, and the distal fibers of the subscapularis tendon. 


Biceps tendon tear 
• 
Approximately 33% of supraspinatus tendon tears are associated with biceps tendon injury (complete tear, partial tear, or degeneration). 

• 
The biceps tendon is at risk for impingement due to its location partially underneath the supraspinatus tendon in the coracoacromial arch. 

• 
In cases of an acute tear, the biceps muscle may retract distally. An empty intertubercular groove may signify a complete tear with retraction or a biceps tendon dislocation. 


Biceps tendon dislocation 

Biceps tendon dislocation: Coronal (left image) and axial T1-weighted MR arthrogram with fat suppression shows medial intra-articular dislocation of the biceps tendon (yellow arrows). The bicipital groove is empty, best seen on the axial image (red arrow). The blue arrows denote the subscapularis tendon, seen on the axial image. 
Case courtesy Kirstin M. Small, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• Biceps tendon subluxation and dislocation are associated with injury to the transverse ligament. The transverse humeral ligament attaches to the greater and lesser tuberosities and normally holds the biceps tendon in place. 
Biceps tendon dislocation

Axial T1-weighted image with fat suppression from an MR arthrogram shows medial dislocation of the biceps tendon (yellow arrow) into the subscapularis. An interstitial tear of the subscapularis tendon is present (blue arrow). 
Case courtesy Kirstin M. Small, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Biceps tendon dislocation is often seen in conjunction with injury of both the transverse ligament and the biceps pulley. 

• 
Medial dislocation of the biceps tendon is associated with tear of the subscapularis tendon (in contrast to biceps tears, which are more frequently associated with supraspinatus injury). 

• 
Axial MRI best demonstrates biceps tendon dislocation. The bicipital groove is empty and the tendon can usually be seen medial to the bicipital groove. 



Instability: Overview and anatomy 
Overview of instability 
• 
Shoulder instability is abnormal motion of the humeral head with respect to the glenoid during movement, producing pain, clicking, or the feeling of an unstable joint. 

• 
Instability can manifest as dislocation, subluxation, or microinstability (repetitive motion). 

• 
The stability of the glenohumeral joint is mostly provided by dynamic and static soft-tissue stabilizers, as there is minimal inherent osseous stability. 

• 
The dynamic stabilizers of the joint include the rotator cuff and biceps tendons. 

• 
The static stabilizer of the joint is the capsulo-labro-ligamentous complex, which is composed of the bony glenoid fossa, labrum, coracohumeral ligament, and superior, middle, and inferior glenohumeral ligaments. 

• 
There are several labral, ligamentous, and osseous injuries associated with instability, but it is unclear if the structural abnormalities are secondary to instability or a cause of it. 

• 
There are various classifications of instability incorporating clinical, etiological, and imaging findings. 

• 
Instability can also be classified as traumatic or atraumatic. Traumatic instability is usually secondary to trauma, causes instability in one direction only, is associated 


with a Bankart lesion, and treated surgically. Traumatic instability is referred to as TUBS (traumatic, unidirectional, Bankart, surgical). Atraumatic instability can be divided into two types. The AIOS (acquired, instability, overstress, surgery) 
pattern is usually seen in athletes with repetitive movements causing microinstability. AMBRI (atraumatic, multidirectional, bilateral, rehabilitation, inferior capsule shift) lesions are due to congenital joint laxity. 
• Radiologists usually classify instability based on the direction of joint subluxation (anterior, posterior, multidirectional, or superior). Similar to traumatic shoulder dislocations, anterior instability accounts for the vast majority (95%) of cases. 
Anatomy of the glenoid labrum 
• The glenoid labrum is a fibrocartilaginous ring-like structure that rests on the glenoid hyaline cartilage and surrounds the glenoid. The labrum increases the surface area and depth of the glenoid cavity. It also provides a suction effect, adhering the humeral head to the glenoid with motion.

the location of labral injury can be described as the sextants outlined above, or can also be described on a clock face, with 12 o’clock superior and 3 o’clock anterior 

• Other important stabilizers of the joint attach directly to the labrum, including the glenohumeral ligaments, the biceps tendon, and the joint capsule. 
Labral normal variants 
• 
A sublabral foramen (seen in 10% of patients) is a normal variant where the anterosuperior segment is not attached to the bony glenoid. 

• 
A Buford complex is an uncommon (seen in up to 6.5%) variant where a cord-like middle glenohumeral ligament is seen in combination with an absent anterosuperior labrum. 

• 
The sublabral recess or foramen (seen in 11% of patients) is an unattached portion of the anterosuperior labrum at the 12 to 3 o’clock position. 





Glenohumeral dislocation 
Anterior glenohumeral dislocation 

Frontal radiograph Sagittal T1-weighted MRI 

Coronal PD-weighted MRI with fat suppression Axial PD-weighted MRI with fat suppression Anterior glenohumeral dislocation with bony Bankart and Hill Sachs lesions: 
Presentation radiograph demonstrated an anterior dislocation, with characteristic inferior position of the humeral head. There is a displaced, crescentic Bankart fracture (yellow arrow). 
MR images after reduction confirm the large bony Bankart fracture of the anterior/inferior glenoid (yellow arrows). There is an impaction fracture of the superior-lateral humeral head (red arrow) with surrounding edema, in keeping with a Hill-Sachs. 
• 
Anterior dislocation of the humerus with respect to the glenoid is by far the most common type of shoulder dislocation. Anterior dislocation is usually caused by direct force on the arm. The humeral head usually dislocates in an anteroinferior direction. 

• 
As the humeral head recoils from the dislocation force, the posterolateral humeral head strikes the anterior-inferior glenoid. This impaction may fracture the humeral head, the glenoid, or both. 

• 
The Hill-Sachs lesion is an impaction fracture of the posterolateral aspect of the humeral head (Hill-Sachs and humerus both start with H). On radiography, the Hill-Sachs lesion is best demonstrated on an AP radiograph with the arm in internal rotation. On cross-sectional imaging, a Hill-Sachs lesion should be above the level of the coracoid, as there is a normal concavity of the humeral head located about the level of the coracoid that can be confused with a chronic Hill-Sachs lesion. 

• 
The Bankart lesion is an injury of the anterior-inferior rim of the glenoid. It may involve the labrum only (soft tissue Bankart) or the glenoid rim (bony Bankart), as in the case above. 


Posterior glenohumeral dislocation 

Posterior shoulder dislocation: Grashey (40° oblique; left image) radiograph shows overlap of the humeral head and the glenoid (arrows); normally, the glenohumeral joint space should be clear on this view. Posterior displacement of the humerus is confirmed on the transscapular Y view (right image). 
• 
Posterior dislocation represents only 2–3% of dislocations and is usually due to severe muscle spasm, such as from seizure or electrocution. The humeral head is dislocated posteriorly in these situations since the posterior pulling muscles of the back are generally stronger than the anterior pushing muscles. 

• 
Diagnosis of a posterior dislocation is much more challenging compared to an anterior dislocation, as the standard frontal radiograph of the shoulder may look close to normal. 

• 
Transscapular Y view or axillary view will best show the posterior dislocation. 


When possible, diagnosis is usually straightforward on an axillary view; however, many patients with posterior shoulder dislocation will not be able to abduct the arm. 
• 
A Grashey (40° oblique) view in a non-dislocated shoulder normally will show clear space between the glenoid and the humeral head; however, in case of posterior dislocation there will be overlap of the medially displaced humeral head with the glenoid. 

• 
The lightbulb sign describes the appearance of the humeral head due to the fixed internal rotation of the arm often seen in posterior dislocation. 

• 
The trough sign describes a compression fracture of the anteromedial aspect of the humeral head, also known as a reverse Hill-Sachs, from impaction of the humeral head on the posterior glenoid rim upon recoil. 


Inferior glenohumeral dislocation (luxatio erecta) 

Luxatio erecta: 
Frontal radiograph shows inferior dislocation of the humerus with characteristic superiorly projecting humerus. 
• 
Inferior dislocation, also called luxatio erecta, is rare (occurring in approximately 1% of dislocations) and is usually caused by direct force to a fully abducted arm. 

• 
Inferior dislocation is often associated with rotator cuff tear and greater tuberosity fracture. 

• 
Inferior dislocation may cause injury to the axillary nerve or artery. 


Dislocations and associated sequela

Instability: Associated lesions 
• The vast majority of the alphabet-soup instability lesions are located at the anterior-inferior aspect of the glenohumeral joint and are associated with the anterior instability and/or sequela of anterior dislocation. 
Bankart lesion 
• 
The Bankart lesion is an injury of the anteroinferior labrum due to anterior glenohumeral dislocation. Specifically, a Bankart is detachment of the anteroinferior labrum from the glenoid, with stripping of the scapular periosteum. 

• 
The labrum may migrate superiorly and appear as a balled-up mass-like object, producing the glenoid labrum ovoid mass (GLOM) sign. The differential diagnosis for a black intra-articular mass on MRI includes: 


GLOM sign (if a Bankart lesion is present inferiorly). Dislocated biceps tendon. Air bubble (if an MR arthrogram was performed). 
• An osseous Bankart (or “bony Bankart”) is a fracture of the anterior-inferior glenoid rim, which predisposes to recurrent dislocation due to glenoid insufficiency. 
Hill-Sachs 
• 
Hill-Sachs is an impaction fracture of the posterolateral humeral head caused by anterior dislocation. The Hill-Sachs lesion can be diagnosed by scrolling through sequential axial images: With standard 5 mm slices, the normal humeral head should appear round in three consecutive slices starting superiorly. If a Hill-Sachs lesion is present, there will be a posterolateral notch in the humeral head. 

• 
Subtle Hill-Sachs can also be detected as bone marrow edema in this location, without fracture. 


Anterior labro-ligamentous periosteal sleeve avulsion (ALPSA) 
• 
An anterior labro-ligamentous periosteal sleeve avulsion (ALPSA) is a variant of the Bankart lesion and also represents an anterior-inferior labral injury. In contrast to the Bankart lesion, the scapular periosteum is intact with an ALPSA. 

• 
Similar to the GLOM sign discussed above, the avulsed anterior-inferior labrum is balled up. However, since the labrum remains attached to the periosteum in an ALPSA lesion, the labrum is displaced inferomedially relative to the glenoid (as opposed to superiorly with the GLOM sign). 


Perthes lesion 
• 
The Perthes lesion is an avulsion of the anterior-inferior labrum, where the labrum remains attached to the scapular periosteum. 

• 
Because the labrum remains attached to periosteum and may remain in its anatomic position, the Perthes lesion can be very difficult to visualize. MR arthrography with ABER (abduction-external rotation) positioning is often necessary for diagnosis. 


Humeral avulsion of the inferior glenohumeral ligament (HAGL) 
• 
Humeral avulsion of the inferior glenohumeral ligament (HAGL) is avulsion of the humeral attachment of the IGHL. This lesion occurs on the opposite (humeral) site of the IGHL compared to the Bankart/ALPSA/Perthes lesions. 

• 
HAGL is associated with subscapularis tendon tears. 


Bony HAGL (BHAGL) 
• A BHAGL is a HAGL lesion with an additional bony avulsion of the anatomic neck of the humerus, caused by avulsion of the IGHL. 
Summary of anterior-inferior instability lesions 

Posterior instability 
• 
Posterior instability is uncommon, accounting for less than 5% of instability. 

• 
The injuries associated with posterior instability are highly variable and include several posterior variations of anterior lesions such as posterior HAGL (PHAGL), reverse Bankart (posterior glenoid fracture), and reverse Hill-Sachs/trough sign. 

• 
Tears of the infraspinatus and teres minor are associated with posterior instability, as these rotator cuff muscles insert on the posterior aspect of the greater tuberosity. 

• 
Hypoplastic posterior glenoid may be a congenital cause of posterior instability. 

• 
The Bennett lesion, also known as thrower’s exostosis, is extra-articular posterior ossification associated with posterior labral injury. The Bennett lesion is often seen in baseball pitchers and is thought to be the result of avulsion of the posterior band of the IGHL. Ossification can be confirmed with an axillary shoulder radiograph. 



Miscellaneous lesions not associated with instability 
Superior labrum anterior posterior (SLAP) tear 

SLAP tear (type II): Coronal T1-weighted MR arthrogram with fat suppression shows high signal within the superior labrum (yellow arrows) extending from anterior to posterior. 
Case courtesy Kirstin M. Small, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
A superior labrum anterior posterior (SLAP) tear is an anterior-posterior oriented tear of the superior labrum centered at the attachment of the biceps tendon. The biceps tendon inserts onto the anterior-superior labrum. There were originally 4 types of SLAP lesions described, however now there are up to 10 different subcategories of SLAP lesions. 

• 
Type I SLAP is isolated fraying of the superior portion of the labrum without a frank tear. The biceps tendon is intact. 

• 
Type II SLAP is the most frequent type of SLAP and features labral fraying in conjunction with stripping of the superior labrum. Type II SLAP lesions are most commonly associated with repetitive microtrauma. 

• 
Type III SLAP is a bucket-handle tear of the superior labrum, analogous to a bucket-handle tear of the knee meniscus. 

• 
Type IV SLAP is also a bucket handle tear of the superior labrum, with additional extension into the biceps tendon. 


Glenoid labral articular disruption (GLAD) 
• 
Glenoid labral articular disruption (GLAD) is a superficial tear of the anterior-inferior labrum, with adjacent glenoid articular cartilage injury. 

• 
Although the GLAD lesion occurs at the anterior-inferior labrum, the same site as the Bankart, ALPSA, and Perthes lesions, GLAD is usually not caused by or associated with instability. 

• 
GLAD lesions may lead to post-traumatic arthritis and intra-articular bodies. 


Paralabral cysts 

Paralabral cyst and labral tear: 
Coronal T2-weighted MRI with fat suppression shows a lobulated paralabral cyst (yellow arrow) medial to the glenoid. 
There is globular intermediate signal within the labrum (red arrow), highly suggestive of labral tear especially in the presence of an adjacent paralabral cyst. 
Case courtesy Kirstin M. Small, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Similar to the formation of parameniscal cysts adjacent to meniscal tears, paralabral cysts form adjacent to labral tears. Paralabral cysts are usually seen in the soft tissues adjacent to the labrum but may extend into bone. A paralabral cyst is a specific finding for a labral tear even when abnormal labral signal is not seen. 

• 
A paralabral cyst may compress a nerve and cause an entrapment neuropathy, discussed below. 



Entrapment neuropathies 
Suprascapular nerve entrapment 

Suprascapular nerve entrapment (continued) 
• 
The proximal suprascapular nerve provides motor innervation to the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. Entrapment of the suprascapular nerve at the suprascapular notch, most commonly from a paralabral cyst associated with a superior labral tear, causes atrophy of both the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. 

• 
The more distal fibers of the suprascapular nerve innervate infraspinatus only. Therefore, impingement at the level of the spinoglenoid notch would cause denervation changes of infraspinatus only.

There is a multiloculated cyst in the region of the spinoglenoid notch (yellow arrows), with resultant infraspinatus edema (red arrows) and focal fatty infiltration (blue arrow). Supraspinatus (green arrows) is normal in muscle bulk and signal intensity. 
Quadrilateral space syndrome 
• 
The quadrilateral space is located at the posterior aspect of the axilla. It is formed by the humerus (laterally), the long head of the triceps muscle (medially), teres minor (superiorly), and teres major (inferiorly). 

• 
The axillary nerve and posterior humeral circumflex artery travel through the quadrilateral space. The axillary nerve provides motor fibers to the teres minor and deltoid. 

• 
Entrapment of the axillary nerve in the quadrilateral space may cause teres minor paresthesias and eventual atrophy, with or without deltoid involvement.
