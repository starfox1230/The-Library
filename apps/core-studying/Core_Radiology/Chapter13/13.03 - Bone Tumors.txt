General approach to bone tumors 
Aggressive appearance 
•
Indistinct margins

•

Nonaggressive appearance 
•
Sclerotic margins 

•

•
Well circumscribed 

•
No endosteal scalloping, aggressive periosteal reaction, or soft tissue component 






Lesion with characteristic imaging features 
Very common in clinical practice! Differential depends on age: 
• 
Adult: Mets/myeloma 

• 
Child/teenager: Ewing/infection 


Very rare in clinical practice! May be tested on boards. 
•
Osteosarcoma 

•
Chondrosarcoma 


Very common in clinical practice! Won’t be tested on boards. 
Can say “fibro-osseous lesion” to sound like a musculoskeletal radiologist. 
•
Enchondroma 

•
Osteoid osteoma 

•
Osteochondroma 

•
Non-ossifying ÿbroma 

•
Hemangioma 

•
Giant cell tumor 

•
Fibrous dysplasia 


• 
Bone tumors can be an intimidating topic because there are so many different types of tumors with similar-sounding names. 

• 
When faced with a bone lesion, it can be helpful to think of bone tumors in 4 groups, as shown above. 

• 
Lesions may have aggressive or nonaggressive imaging appearances. Indistinct margins, aggressive periosteal reaction (as illustrated on the following page), wide zone of transition, permeative appearance, soft tissue component, and endosteal scalloping are aggressive imaging features. Any one of these features may be enough to be concerning. 

• 
Additionally, some bone lesions can have characteristic imaging features to allow you to arrive at a specific diagnosis (perhaps more on tests than in real life). These are the lesions that should be learned (listed on the right side in the diagram above) and include both benign and malignant etiologies. 

• 
In clinical practice, it is far more common for bone lesions to not have specific imaging features, and management should be determined based on aggressive versus nonaggressive appearance.

Morphology 
Periosteal reaction 
• The morphology of a bone lesion’s associated periosteal reaction gives an important clue to the rate of growth, and hence the aggressiveness, of the lesion. 
Normal periosteal anatomy 

Periosteum covers essentially the entire bone excluding the joint surfaces. 

Benign: Solid periosteal reaction 

A slow-growing process, such as osteoid osteoma (radiolucent nidus), incites the periosteal cells to lay down bone in a smooth, continuous manner. 

Aggressive: Lamellated periosteal reaction 

An irregularly-growing process that grows in starts and stops produces a characteristic lamellated or onion-skinned appearance (arrows). When the lesion is growing quickly the periosteal cells don’t have enough time to lay down bone. 

Very aggressive: Sunburst periosteal reaction 


A very fast growing lesion pushes the periosteal cells outward as the lesion expands, with each periosteal cell leaving a trail of bone formation that looks like hair on end or sunburst (arrows). 

Very very aggressive: Codman triangle 


A lesion that grows so aggressively that the periosteum does not even have a chance to lay down visible calciÿcation except at the periphery produces a characteristic Codman triangle (yellow arrow). 
Note the associated soft tissue mass (red arrows).

Lodwick classification of bone destruction 


Pattern of bone destruction: Margin analysis 
• 
Analysis of a bone lesion’s margins (i.e., zone of transition from normal to abnormal bone) helps to characterize the bony destruction and stratify a lesion as aggressive or non aggressive. 

• 
A sharply marginated zone of transition usually denotes a less aggressive lesion with slower rate of growth. The faster the rate of growth, the more aggressive the lesion may be. A wide zone of transition suggests rapid growth and a more aggressive lesion. 

• 
The Lodwick classification of bone destruction helps to stratify aggressiveness: 

• 
Type 1: Geographic pattern: Margins have a thin zone of transition and may be sclerotic or 


well-defined. 1A: Thin sclerotic margins. Almost always nonaggressive. 1B: Well-defined margins. Usually nonaggressive. 1C: Any part of the margin is indistinct. 
• 
Type 2: Moth-eaten pattern: It is difficult to define any border at all. Aggressive. 

• 
Type 3: Permeative: The permeative pattern is characterized by multiple tiny holes that infiltrate the bone. This pattern is very aggressive and is seen in lymphoma, leukemia, and Ewing sarcoma. 

• 
A pseudopermeative process describes the appearance of osteoporosis and osseous hemangioma, two benign conditions. Unlike the true permeative appearance of an aggressive lesion, the pseudopermeative appearance seen in these two entities will extend to the cortex. 



New matrix created by tumor 
• 
Matrix produced by an osteoid lesion, such as malignant osteosarcoma, appears as fluffy, cloud-like bone. 

• 
Matrix produced by a chondroid lesion, such as a benign enchondroma or malignant chondrosarcoma, has a ring and arc or popcorn-like appearance. 

• 
A ground glass matrix describes blurring of the trabeculae and is seen in fibrous dysplasia, a benign fibrosseous lesion involving abnormal proliferation of intraosseous fibroblasts. 


Unique features 
• 
The fallen-fragment sign is seen in a simple (unicameral) bone cyst with pathologic fracture. 

• 
An aneurysmal or expansile appearance suggests an aneurysmal bone cyst. 

• 
Resorption of distal clavicles or tumoral calcinosis can suggest hyperparathyroidism, which can cause brown tumors. 




Patient age 
• 
The two most likely considerations of an aggressive lytic bone lesion in a patient over age 40 are metastasis or myeloma. 

• 
Under age 20, an aggressive lytic lesion is most likely to represent eosinophilic granuloma, infection, or Ewing sarcoma. 



Location within bone 
Eccentric within bone 
• Giant-cell tumor, chondroblastoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, non-ossifying fibroma, and the rare chondromyxoid fibroma are located eccentrically within the bone. 
Central (in the middle of a long bone) 
• Simple bone cyst, enchondroma, and fibrous dysplasia are located centrally within the bone. MSK: 936
