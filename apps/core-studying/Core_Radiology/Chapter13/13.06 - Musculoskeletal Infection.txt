Septic arthritis 
Overview of septic arthritis 
• 
Septic arthritis, which is bacterial infection of a joint, is a medical emergency. Rapid diagnosis and treatment are essential to preserve the joint, as permanent cartilage damage can occur within three days. 

• 
Septic arthritis is not typically an imaging diagnosis, and radiographs are commonly normal. However, radiographs should be performed to evaluate for changes of advanced infection (such as effusion, soft tissue swelling, or bony erosive changes) and also to exclude an alternative explanation for the patient’s pain (such as fracture, calcific tendinitis, severe degenerative changes, etc.). 

• 
In a patient with an acute mono-articular (involving only one joint) arthritis, septic arthritis should be a primary diagnostic consideration, even in the absence of fever or other systemic signs of infection. 

• 
Diagnosis is confirmed with joint aspiration (arthrocentesis). Although it can take days for complete microbiology results to become available, the aspirated fluid white blood cell (WBC) count and percentage of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) can be used to predict the probability of septic arthritis: 



Based on the table above, for instance, a fluid WBC count of >50,000 is 92% specific for septic arthritis; however, this is only seen in 62% of cases of septic arthritis. Empiric treatment for septic arthritis is reasonable for a WBC count of >50,000. A common alternative etiology for elevated WBC count includes crystal arthropathy. 


Osteomyelitis 
Overview of osteomyelitis 
• 
Literally meaning “inflammation (–itis) of the bone (osteo–) marrow (–myelo–),” osteomyelitis is inflammation of the bone caused by an infectious organism.  Osteomyelitis has protean clinical and imaging manifestations, with an end pathway of chronic progressive bony destruction if untreated. 

• 
Osteomyelitis can be classified by route of spread (hematogenous, contiguous spread, or direct inoculation) or by chronicity (acute or chronic), although any route of spread can lead to either acute or chronic disease. 


The differentiation of acute, subacute, and chronic osteomyelitis is variably described in the literature. In general, acute osteomyelitis is less than two weeks duration. Subacute osteomyelitis is the phase of disease lasting less than three months but without acute symptoms. 
The pathologic hallmark of chronic osteomyelitis is bone necrosis. 

Overview of osteomyelitis (continued) 
• The anatomic distribution and clinical presentation of osteomyelitis is highly dependent on the age of the patient, the specific organism, and the presence of any underlying disorders, such as vascular insufficiency or compromised immunity. 
In adults, osteomyelitis typically arises from either contiguous spread or direct inoculation, such as in diabetic foot infections, open fractures, or as a complication of surgery. Infection is usually polymicrobial. 
In children, hematogenous spread of infection is more common, usually from Staphylococcus aureus. 

Terminology of osteomyelitis 
Acute hematogenous Subacute osteomyelitis Chronic osteomyelitis osteomyelitis

• 
Osteitis is inflammation/infection of the cortex. 

• 
Periostitis is inflammation/infection of the periosteum. 

• 
A sequestrum is a piece of necrotic bone that is separated (sequestered) from viable bone by granulation tissue. A sequestrum is a surgical lesion that can chronically harbor living organisms and function as a nidus for recurrent infection if not resected. 

• 
An involucrum is living bone surrounding necrotic bone. 

• 
A cloaca is an opening on the involucrum. 

• 
A sinus tract is an opening from the infection to the skin surface. 

• 
A Brodie abscess is a form of subacute osteomyelitis characterized by central lucency and peripheral sclerosis. The radiographic differential diagnosis of a Brodie abscess is an osteoid osteoma. 



Hematogenous osteomyelitis 
• 
Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis is usually seen in infants and children. The highly vascularized metaphyses of long bones are most commonly affected. Metaphyseal venules have sluggish flow which facilitate bacterial invasion. 

• 
In infants up to 12 months old, infections can involve the metaphysis, epiphysis, and joint due to the presence of bridging vessels which cross the physis. In older children, infection tends to be isolated to the metaphysis. In adults, the physes are closed but hematogenous metaphyseal infection is uncommon.

• 
Hematogenous infection is typically caused by a single organism. If blood cultures are positive then that specific organism can be targeted and biopsy is generally not needed. 

• 
Hematogenous osteomyelitis occurs from the inside out, beginning with infection of the medullary cavity. Secondary involvement of the cortex occurs as bacteria spread through Haversian and Volkmann canals into the periosteum and subsequently the soft tissues. In infants and children, the periosteum is loosely adherent to the bone, causing prominent lifting of the periosteum by infection. This manifests radiographically as exuberant periostitis. In contrast, in adults the periosteum is more tightly adherent to bone and periostitis is less prominent. 



initial infection is infection spreads through intra-medullary the cortex and uplifts the periosteum 
• 
In adults, hematogenous osteomyelitis most commonly affects the spine. 

• 
Chronic osteomyelitis may produce infected nonviable tissue (sequestrum). An involucrum is living bone which surrounds the sequestrum. The involucrum may be perforated by cloacae, which can open to the skin to form a sinus tract. Chronic drainage of sinus tract predisposes to squamous cell carcinoma. 

• 
Initial subtle radiographic changes in hematogenous osteomyelitis include focal soft-tissue swelling, regional osteopenia, and obliteration of the soft-tissue fat planes. 

• 
The radiographic appearance of medullary infection is a focal, ill-defined lucent metaphyseal lesion. The lucency may cross the epiphysis in young children, where epiphyseal bridging vessels may be still patent. Periosteal reaction may appear aggressive and lamellated, mimicking Ewing sarcoma. 



Contiguous focus osteomyelitis 
• Osteomyelitis in adults is most commonly from contiguous spread of infection, characterized by penetration of the periosteum and cortex and subsequent medullary invasion. 

osteomyelitis 
• 
One of the most common causes of adult osteomyelitis is contiguous spread of a diabetic foot ulcer to the bones. Diabetic neuropathy leads to development of foot ulcers due to unrecognized trauma and impaired vascular reserve. 

• 
The primary differential diagnosis of diabetic foot osteomyelitis is a neuropathic joint, a common sequela of diabetic neuropathy. 





Neuropathic arthropathy usually affects the midfoot and features polyarticular involvement, absence of 
contiguous soft-tissue infection, and absence of an associated ulcer/sinus tract. The bony cortex is intact. In contrast, diabetic foot osteomyelitis is almost always associated with a cutaneous ulcer and a sinus tract to the bone. The cortex of the involved bone is often disrupted. 
Abnormal marrow signal is seen in both neuropathic arthropathy and diabetic foot osteomyelitis. 
• In contrast to hematogenous osteomyelitis, contiguous focus osteomyelitis is typically polymicrobial and biopsy is often warranted to ensure proper treatment. 
Brodie abscess 

Axial (left image) and sagittal CT images through the knee demonstrate a lytic lesion (yellow arrows) of the tibial metaphysis with surrounding reactive sclerosis (red arrows) and overlying pretibial soft tissue swelling (blue arrows). 
• Brodie abscess is a characteristic lesion of subacute osteomyelitis, consisting of a walled-off intra-osseous abscess surrounded by granulation tissue and sclerotic bone. 
Chronic osteomyelitis 
• 
Chronic osteomyelitis is an indolent infection lasting more than 6 weeks. Devascularized, necrotic bone leads to a sequestrum surrounded by granulation tissue and involucrum. 

• 
Chronic osteomyelitis can cause a mixed lytic and sclerotic appearance, with a thickened cortex. 

• 
It can be difficult to differentiate between active and inactive chronic osteomyelitis. Serial radiographs in active chronic osteomyelitis may show development of periosteal reaction. 

• 
Sclerosing osteomyelitis, also known as osteomyelitis of Garré, is an uncommon form of chronic osteomyelitis characterized by sclerosis and thickening of bone. The differential diagnosis of sclerosing osteomyelitis includes lymphoma, sclerotic metastasis, and osteoid osteoma. 


Specific organisms causing osteomyelitis 
• 
Staphylococcus: Staph. aureus is the most common cause of hematogenous osteomyelitis. 

• 
Salmonella: Osteomyelitis from Salmonella is typically seen in patients with sickle cell disease, with a propensity to affect the diaphysis. It may be difficult to distinguish between diaphyseal bone infarct and osteomyelitis in sickle cell patients. 

• 
Pseudomonas: Osteomyelitis from Pseudomonas aeruginosa is classically caused by a puncture wound of the foot through a sneaker. 

• 
Tuberculosis: The most common musculoskeletal infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is infection of the spine, also known as Pott disease. 


Specific locations 
• 
Hand and finger: The metacarpals and phalanges may become infected after a bite wound. 

• 
Toe: A stubbed great toe with nail-bed injury is at risk for osteomyelitis of the distal phalanx, due to the location of periosteum immediately adjacent to the nail bed. 

• 
Spine: Vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis in an adult may be caused by hematogenous arterial spread, spinal surgery, or spread of a genitourinary infection through the epidural venous Batson plexus. Infection begins in the subendplate region of the vertebral body and subsequently spreads to the endplate, intervertebral disc, and adjacent vertebral body. 


In contrast, in children discitis is thought to represent direct hematogenous seeding of the persistently vascularized disc.

• 
Radiographs are typically the first modality to evaluate suspected osteomyelitis although it typically takes between 10–14 days for radiographic changes to be evident. 

• 
Radiographic findings depend on the route of spread. Early radiographic changes of hematogenous osteomyelitis include focal osteopenia due to reactive hyperemia, followed by a lucent medullary lesion. In contiguous focus osteomyelitis, the first radiographic sign may be soft-tissue swelling and periosteal reaction, followed by erosion of the cortex. 

• 
Scintigraphy and MRI imaging are more sensitive to detect early osteomyelitis. 

• 
Three-phase Tc-99m MDP bone scan becomes positive within 24–48 hours after the onset of symptoms. Acute osteomyelitis is positive on all three phases (flow, blood pool, and delayed). 


In contrast, cellulitis is positive on flow and blood pool phases, and negative on delayed. Although highly sensitive, Tc-99m bone scan is less specific than leukocyte scintigraphy and MRI. 
• Combining WBC and sulfur colloid scintigraphy adds specificity in the evaluation of osteomyelitis because bone marrow is replaced by infection and white cells. Actively infected bone marrow will show discordantly increased uptake on the WBC scan and reduced activity on sulfur colloid. Note that WBC scan imaging is not sensitive for spinal osteomyelitis, thought to be due to the inability of 
leukocytes to migrate into an encapsulated infection. WBC scan can be performed with either Indium-111-WBC or Tc-99m-HMPAO-WBC. Indium WBC scan has higher radiation dose, takes 24 hours to perform, and the image has more noise. The disadvantage of Tc-99m-HMPAO is its tendency to dissociate, leading to genitourinary excretion of radiotracer. 
• 
MRI is highly sensitive to detect early osteomyelitis within 3–5 days. MRI has similar sensitivity to radionuclide studies, but greater specificity. MRI can better delineate the extent of infection, any fluid collections that must be treated surgically, sinus tracts, and skin ulcers. 

• 
The hallmark of MRI imaging of osteomyelitis is replacement of the normal fatty marrow signal. Edema and exudates cause high marrow signal on T2-weighted images and low signal on T1-weighted images. MRI has very high negative predictive value: A negative MRI essentially excludes osteomyelitis. 


Abnormal signal intensity in the bone on fluid-sensitive sequences does not necessarily signify that osteomyelitis is present. To confidently diagnose osteomyelitis on MR, the T1-weighted images should be carefully scrutinized. Three patterns of signal alteration on T1-weighted images have been described, which are confluent intramedullary, hazy reticular, and subcortical. Of these, only the confluent intramedullary pattern is highly associated with osteomyelitis.

Gadolinium is helpful to delineate any fluid collections and to evaluate for the presence of nonenhancing necrotic bone (sequestrum), although gadolinium is not necessary to confidently diagnose osteomyelitis.

• 
Necrotizing fasciitis is an extremely aggressive soft-tissue infection caused by Clostridium or other gram-positive rods. It is a surgical emergency, requiring immediate debridement. 

• 
The characteristic radiographic and CT finding of necrotizing fasciitis is gas bubbles in the soft tissues.

• 
Pyomyositis is bacterial infection of the muscle. It was historically called tropical myositis because it was first recognized in tropical regions of the globe, classically occurring in young males after vigorous exercise. 

• 
Currently, the incidence of pyomyositis is increasing in the United States, with diabetes a substantial risk factor. 

• 
Staphylococcus aureus causes the majority of cases.
