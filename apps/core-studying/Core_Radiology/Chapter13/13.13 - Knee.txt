Knee 
Knee trauma 
Knee dislocation 

Posterior dislocation with vascular injury: Frontal radiograph of the knee (left image) shows marked widening of the joint space with slight lateral displacement of the tibia. The widened joint space suggests a dislocation. An ossific fragment projects over the joint space (red arrow). Intraoperative digital subtraction angiogram (right image) demonstrates a complete traumatic occlusion of the popliteal artery (arrow) just above the knee. 
• 
The knee may dislocate in any direction, although anteriorly is the most common. 

• 
There is a high risk for vascular injury to the popliteal artery, and a vascular injury may be present even if the distal pulses are still intact. CT angiography is therefore typically recommended for all knee dislocations. 


Patellar fracture 
• 
Patellar fracture may be caused by a direct blow (usually causing a comminuted fracture) or extreme sudden tension of the extensor mechanism (usually causing a distracted fracture). 

• 
It is important to distinguish a fracture from a bipartite or multipartite patella, which are normal variants and will have well corticated margins. A dorsal defect of the patella is another normal variant, appearing as a round lucency at the superior articular (dorsal) aspect of the patella. 



Tibial plateau fracture 
• 
Tibial plateau fractures are classified by the Schatzker classification. 

• 
Lateral tibial plateau fractures are more stable than medial tibial plateau fractures. 



Menisci

meniscal body articular surface of tibia 
posterior horn of medial meniscus posterior horn of 
lateral meniscus anterior meniscofemoral ligament (Humphry) PCL posterior meniscofemoral ligament (Wrisberg) attachment 
• 
The medial and lateral menisci are crescent-shaped fi brocarti laginous structures that form a disconti nuous fi gure-8 to stabilize the knee and disperse the axial loading. 

• 
Each meniscus consists of an anterior and a posterior horn. The posterior horn of the medial meniscus is larger than its anterior horn. Both horns of the lateral meniscus are the same size. 

• 
Each meniscus is att ached to the ti bial plateau by an anterior and posterior meniscal root. Trauma to the meniscal root may cause meniscal extrusion. 

• 
There are two meniscofemoral ligaments, which extend from the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus to the medial femoral condyle. It is important not to mistake a meniscofemoral ligament (which are variably present) for a meniscal tear. 


The ligament of Humphrey is anterior to PCL; the ligament of Wrisberg is posterior to the PCL. 
• 
The peripheral third of each meniscus is relati vely vascular and is called the red zone. The central porti on of the meniscus is considered avascular. 

• 
Meniscal injuries confi ned to the red zone may heal spontaneously or aft er surgical repair, while more central meniscal injuries generally do not heal. 


Normal appearance of menisci on MR

Myxoid degeneration versus tear 
• 
Myxoid degenerati on is increased signal on T2-weighted images within the meniscus that does not extend to the meniscal surface. It is not thought to cause symptoms and is not treated. 

• 
In contrast, a meniscal tear is seen as a linear band of increased signal on T2­weighted images that does extend to the arti cular surface. The morphology of the meniscus is commonly abnormal. MRI is >90% sensiti ve and specifi c for the diagnosis of meniscal tears. 


Oblique/horizontal tear

Note the associated parameniscal cysts (red arrow). 
Case courtesy Nehal Shah, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
The terms oblique and horizontal are someti mes used interchangeably when referring to meniscal tears. Strictly speaking, however, a horizontal tear remains parallel to the ti bial plateau, while an oblique tear may be at a slight angle to the ti bial plateau. 

• 
An oblique/horizontal tear is the most common meniscal tear, typically occurring in the posterior horn of the medial meniscus. 

• 
Oblique and horizontal tears are more oft en degenerati ve, rather than due to trauma. MSK: 1015 


Vertical/longitudinal tear 
axial or arthroscopic view sagittal schematic sagittal MRI 
Nehal Shah, MD 
A vertical (longitudinal) tear is present (arrow) demonstrating complete superior-to-inferior surface extension. 
• The verti cal (synonymous with longitudinal) tear is a curved tear that follows the contour of the meniscus. On serial sagitt al images, the tear will be in a verti cal orientati on and will remain a fi xed distance from the edge of the meniscus.

• 
The result of a longitudinal verti cal tear, a bucket-handle tear occurs when the free inner edge of the meniscus (medial meniscus most commonly) gets displaced or fl ipped over. 

• 
The most common locati on of the displaced meniscal fragment is the intercondylar notch, but the meniscal fragment may also displace anteriorly or posteriorly. 

• 
The absent bow ti e sign represents the absent (displaced) meniscal horn. MSK: 1016 


Bucket handle tear (continued) 

Double PCL sign: Sagittal (left image) and coronal PD-weighted MRI with fat suppression demonstrates a bucket-handle tear of the medial meniscus (yellow arrows), which is displaced into the intercondylar notch, creating a double PCL sign on the sagittal. Note the normal PCL (red arrow). 


• 
The double delta sign is seen with an anteriorly displaced longitudinal vertical meniscal fragment. The displaced fragment is located more posterior compared to the native anterior horn, which is pushed anteriorly. 

• 
The double PCL sign is seen when the posterior horn longitudinal vertical meniscal flap does not flip all the way anteriorly. 

• 
A double delta sign or double PCL sign depends on if the medial or lateral meniscus is involved, and on the status of the ACL (for medial meniscal tears only). 

• 
A peripheral longitudinal tear of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus cannot flip anteriorly if the ACL is intact. Therefore, a medial meniscus bucket handle tear is far more likely to cause the double PCL sign. 

• 
A peripheral longitudinal tear of the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus is not impeded by the ACL and the double delta sign can occur. 

• 
In summary, a double delta sign is likely a lateral meniscal tear (or far less commonly, a medial meniscus tear with torn ACL). A double PCL sign is likely a medial meniscus tear (with intact ACL). 


Radial/transverse tear 
radial tear of meniscal body 
axial or arthroscopic view sagittal schematic sagittal MRI 
Radial tear is a vertically oriented tear extending from the free edge of the meniscus to the periphery.

Ghost meniscus sign: No meniscal tissue is seen when the plane of imaging is directly through the radial tear (arrows). 
Cases courtesy Nehal Shah, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
A radial tear (also known as a transverse tear) is a verti cally oriented tear that is perpendicular to the arc of the meniscus. In contrast, a previously discussed verti cal/ longitudinal tear follows the curve of the meniscus. 

• 
On a single image, a radial tear may be indisti nguishable from a verti cal/longitudinal tear. On serial sagitt al images, however, the radial tear will change positi on relati ve to the edge of the meniscus. This phenomenon is the marching cleft sign. 

• 
Depending on the orientati on of the tear in relati on to the scan plane, a radial tear may also show the ghost meniscus sign. The ghost meniscus is typically described as absence of the posterior horn of the meniscus on sagitt al images (although it may also occur with absence of the anterior horn, as seen above). It occurs in tears adjacent to the intercondylar notch. 

• 
Radial tears are associated with a high rate of meniscal extrusion, which may lead to osteoarthriti s if not treated. 


Parameniscal cyst 
• 
A parameniscal cyst is loculated fl uid adjacent to the meniscus, thought to result from extension of joint fl uid through a meniscal tear. 

• 
Parameniscal cysts are most commonly associated with horizontal cleavage tears. 

• 
It is important to menti on the presence of a parameniscal cyst because the cyst may conti nue to cause symptoms even if the meniscus is resected. Not all cysts are able to be visualized by arthroscopy. 


Discoid meniscus 
axial or arthroscopic view sagittal schematic sagittal MRI 

Case courtesy Nehal Shah, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 

Coronal PD-weighted MRI with fat suppression demonstrates a discoid lateral meniscus (arrow). 
• 
Discoid meniscus is a spectrum of congenital malformations of the meniscus that ranges from increased thickness of the meniscus to a complete disc-like shape. Discoid meniscus is defined by having a portion of the meniscus which extends to the central tibial plateau. 

• 
Discoid meniscus typically affects children and is a common cause of joint-line pain, clicking, or locking in a child or adolescent. Discoid meniscus is prone to undergo cystic degeneration and tear. Even in the absence of a tear, a discoid meniscus may be symptomatic. 

• 
The lateral meniscus is more commonly affected. 

• 
On MRI, a meniscus is discoid if an oval or bow tie-shaped meniscus is seen on three or more contiguous sagittal slices with standard 4 mm thick sagittal slices (representing 12 mm in medial-lateral thickness). 




Knee Ligaments 
Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) overview 
• 
The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) arises from the femoral intercondylar notch and attaches on the anterior tibial plateau, directly lateral to the tibial spine. The tibial attachment of the ACL is stronger than its femoral origin. The ACL is composed of two fiber bundles, a small anteromedial band and larger posterolateral band. 

• 
Mucoid degeneration shows thickening of ACL with intermediate T2 hyperintense signal and a celery stalk appearance. 



Normal ACL: Sagittal proton-density (left image) and coronal proton-density fat-saturated (right image) MRI shows the normal course of the ACL fibers with the typical striated appearance (blue arrow) on the sagittal image. The coronal image demonstrates the smaller anteromedial (yellow arrow) and larger posterolateral (red arrow) fiber bundles in the intercondylar notch. 
ACL tear 
• 
ACL tear is typically caused by an acute injury. 

• 
MRI of ACL tear may show either frank discontinuity of the ligament fibers or abnormal course and signal of the ligament. 



ACL tear: Sagittal fluid-sensitive MRI demonstrates frank rupture of the ACL (arrows), with discontinuity of the fibers and increased signal. 
Case courtesy Nehal Shah, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
ACL injury is often associated with meniscal tears and MCL tears (O’Donoghue’s triad). Posterolateral corner knee injuries are also frequently seen in association with ACL injury. 

• 
There are multiple secondary findings of ACL injury. A characteristic bone contusion pattern with bone marrow edema in the lateral femoral condyle and the posterolateral tibial plateau is highly suggestive of ACL injury. Secondary buckling of the posterior collateral ligament (PCL) may also be seen due to anterior displacement of the tibia (positive drawer sign). 




Cases courtesy Nehal Shah, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• A clue to ACL injury on radiography is a Segond fracture, which is an avulsion fracture of the lateral tibia plateau. Segond fracture is associated with both ACL injury and iliotibial (IT) band injury. The IT band inserts on Gerdy’s tubercle of the tibia. 
The Segond fracture is thought to represent detachment of the lateral capsular ligament. 

Segond fracture: Frontal knee radiograph shows an 
avulsion fracture of the 
lateral tibial plateau (arrow). 
These fractures can be easily missed on radiography, but are important to diagnose. 
MRI should be recommended if a Segond fracture is seen. 
• After ACL reconstruction, the ACL graft should run parallel to the intercondylar notch, 
behind Blumensaat’s line (a line drawn on radiography along the intercondylar roof). If the reconstructed ACL is too steep . graft can be impinged by the femur with leg extension. If the reconstructed ACL is too lax . graft may not provide enough stability. A complication of ACL reconstruction is the cyclops lesion, which is nodular scarring in Hoffa’s fat pad. 

Cyclops lesion post-ACL reconstruction: Fluid-sensitive sagittal MRI shows nodular soft-tissue (arrow) anterior to the reconstructed ACL. 
Case courtesy Nehal Shah, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston 
Posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) overview 
• The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is a stronger, thicker ligament than the ACL. It also arises from the femoral intercondylar notch (more anteriorly than the ACL), but inserts on the posterior tibial plateau. 
The PCL is normally low signal on all sequences. The PCL is much less commonly injured than ACL. 
PCL tear 
• 
In contrast to an ACL tear, a complete disruption of the PCL fibers is uncommon. 

• 
The typical MRI appearance of PCL injury is increased laxity of the PCL, with or without abnormal high signal on T2-weighted images. 




Cases courtesy Nehal Shah, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• PCL tears tend to be less frequently repaired compared to ACL tears. 
Medial collateral ligament (MCL) overview 
• The medial collateral ligament (MCL) arises from the posterior aspect of the medial femoral 
condyle and attaches to the medial tibial metaphysis, deep to the pes anserinus. The MCL fibers are interlaced with the joint capsule and the medial meniscus. The MCL is an extrasynovial structure and is not visualized by arthroscopy. 
MCL injury 

Two patients with full-thickness (grade 3) MCL injuries, seen on coronal PD-weighted MRI with fat suppression. The left image shows a full thickness tear of the distal (tibial) attachment (arrow), with undulated appearance of the proximally retracted torn tendon. The right image demonstrates a full thickness tear of the proximal (femoral) attachment (arrow). 
• MCL injuries are commonly divided into three grades: 
Grade 1 (MCL sprain): High signal in the medial soft tissues with normal signal of the ligament. Grade 2 (severe sprain/partial tear): High signal or partial disruption within the MCL fibers. Grade 3 (complete tear): Complete disruption of the MCL. 
• 
MCL injuries are caused by a tensile (pulling) force on the ligament. This most commonly occurs in the setting of valgus stress (impact on the lateral knee). Edema around the MCL is very common in the setting of osteoarthritis, and it is important not to mistake periligamentous edema in an older individual for an MCL sprain. MCL sprains most commonly occur in young athletes. 

• 
The Pellegrini-Stieda lesion is post-traumatic calcification medial to the medial femoral condyle, which may be secondary to MCL avulsion injury. 



Pellegrini-Stieda lesion: Frontal radiograph demonstrates mineralization of the medial femoral condyle (arrow), suggestive of a remote MCL injury. 
Lateral collateral ligament (LCL) complex 
• The lateral collateral ligament (LCL) complex is composed of many structures, three of which are routinely evaluated by MRI. From posterior to anterior, these structures are: Biceps femoris tendon (most posterior), LCL, and iliotibial band (most anterior). 

The biceps femoris tendon and the biceps femoris tendon 
LCL both attach on the lateral ÿbular head, 
most posterior 
where they often have a conjoined tendon. 
LCL 
The iliotibial band attaches to Gerdy’s tubercle on the proximal lateral tibia. iliotibial band 
most anterior 
LCL injury 
• 
LCL injury is less common than MCL injury and is usually associated with injury to other structures in the posterolateral corner. Injury to the posterolateral corner is a surgical near-emergency as there is poor outcome without prompt intervention. 

• 
The posterolateral corner of the knee is a complex region consisting of: LCL complex, consisting of the biceps femoris tendon, LCL, and the iliotibial band. Arcuate ligament, a Y-shaped ligament connecting the fibula to the lateral femur. Popliteofibular ligaments, which are important lateral stabilizers. Popliteus tendon, which inserts on the lateral femur. 


Iliotibial band syndrome 
• 
Fluid surrounding (both superficial and deep to) the iliotibial band may represent iliotibial (IT) band syndrome, which is caused by friction between the anterolateral femur and the tendon of the iliotibial band. 

• 
Clinically, IT band syndrome may be a cause of anterolateral knee pain and is seen commonly in runners. 

• 
It is important to distinguish IT band syndrome from a lateral meniscus tear. Both may present with lateral knee pain, but treatment of iliotibial band syndrome is nonsurgical. 



Extensor mechanism and patella 
Normal anatomy of the extensor mechanism 
• 
The extensor mechanism is composed of the conjoined quadriceps tendon (attaches to the 

patella), the patella, and the patellar tendon (attaches to the tibial tuberosity). The patella is a sesamoid bone and is enclosed within the quadriceps tendon. 

• 
Three of the quadriceps muscles (vastus intermedius, medialis, and lateralis) originate from the femur. The rectus femoris arises from the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS). 


Quadriceps tendon tear 

Quadriceps tendon tear: Sagittal proton density fat-saturated (left image) and proton density (right image) MRI show complete disruption of the distal quadriceps tendon (yellow arrows) with surrounding marked edema. There is secondary buckling of the patellar tendon (red arrow). 
Case courtesy Nehal Shah, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Tear of the quadriceps tendon clinically presents with loss of knee extension. 

• 
Quadriceps tendon tear most commonly occurs within 2 cm of the patella and may be evident on radiography due to the resultant patella baja (patella too low). The opposite of patella baja is patella alta, which can be seen with patellar tendon injury. 


Patellar tendon injury 
• 
Similar to quadriceps tendon tear, patellar tendon tear clinically presents with loss of knee extension. 

• 
In contrast to quadriceps tendon tear, tear of the patella tendon causes superior displacement of the patella (patella alta). 

• 
Patellar tendinosis is seen on MRI as thickening of the patellar tendon. This is known as 


jumper’s knee. 
Lateral patellar dislocation 
• Traumatic lateral patellar dislocation leaves behind a distinctive pattern of injury, even if the patella reduces back to the normal position. Bone marrow contusions of the lateral femoral condyle and the medial patellar facet are typical, with tearing of the medial retinaculum. 


Cases courtesy Nehal Shah, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
Osgood-Schlatter disease 

Osgood-Schlatter disease: Sagittal fluid-sensitive (left image) and proton density (right image) MRI show an enlarged, fragmented tibial tubercle (yellow arrows). There is associated edema anterior to the tibial tubercle and within Hoffa’s fat pad (red arrow). 
Case courtesy Nehal Shah, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Osgood-Schlatter disease is an osteochondrosis of the tibial tubercle, thought to be caused by repetitive microtrauma. It occurs in adolescents. 

• 
Radiographs show an enlarged tibial tuberosity with fragmentation and adjacent edema. 

• 
MRI shows increased signal of the distal patellar tendon, marrow edema within the tibial tubercle, and edema within Hoffa’s fat pad. 



Knee cartilage 
Grading of cartilage degeneration 

Superficial fissuring of the medial trochlea (grade 2; Full thickness defect (grade 4) of the medial patellar yellow arrow) and deep fissuring of the central trochlea facet, with delamination (arrow) extending to the (grade 3; red arrow). median ridge. 
• 
The Outerbridge classification, summarized below, is a commonly used system for describing articular cartilage injury or degeneration. In general, it is best to describe the cartilage surfaces using descriptive words rather than assigning a grade. 

• 
In the knee, there are three compartments and six chondral surfaces. The patellofemoral compartment consists of the patellar and trochlear cartilage. The medial and lateral tibiofemoral compartments each consist of the femoral condyle and the tibial plateau. A cartilage defect should have the location, severity, and size described. 

• 
Cartilage injury or degeneration may manifest as surface irregularity, fissuring, focal or diffuse thinning, or delamination. Delamination is a dissecting-type detachment of the cartilage undersurface from bone, paralleling the subchondral bone.

Osteochondral lesions of the knee 


Avascular necrosis (any age, but can be younger patient if history of prolonged steroid use or sickle cell), in a third patient: Coronal PD-weighted MRI with fat suppression demonstrates linear fluid signal (yellow arrow) undercutting the subchondral bone plate of the lateral femoral condyle, in keeping with an unstable osteochondral lesion. There is surrounding heterogeneous marrow signal with prominent edema. Note the serpiginous edema of the medial femoral condyle (red arrow) without abnormality of the subchondral bone plate, in keeping with avascular necrosis. Arthroscopic image from the same patient demonstrates the probe easily entering the unstable defect. 
• 
Osteochondral lesion, osteochondral defect, and osteochondral injury are interchangeable generic terms (rather than specific diagnoses) used to describe a range of focal disorders of the articular cartilage, subchondral bone plate, and subchondral bone. There are a wide range of causes including osteochondritis dissecans, osteochondral fracture, subchondral insufficiency fracture, and avascular necrosis. There can often be imaging overlap between these entities, especially in advanced cases with development of an unstable fragment. 

• 
It is usually not necessary to grade the severity of the osteochondral lesion. However, it is important to note if fluid or cystic change deep to the lesion is present, implying that the lesion is unstable (meaning that the lesion can be displaced by an arthroscopist’s probe). Also, if the lesion is displaced this should also be described. 

• 
Osteochondritis dissecans is a developmental disorder of subchondral bone, resulting in formation of an unstable subchondral bone fragment. It tends to occur in pediatrics and adolescents. 

• 
Osteochondral fracture is a result of an acute or chronic repetitive trauma, causing injury to the cartilage and subchondral bone. 


Osteochondral lesions of the knee (continued) 
• 
Subchondral insufficiency fracture is caused by collapse of the subchondral bone, typically in older patients. One key imaging finding is thickening and irregularity of the subchondral bone plate, often with exuberant surrounding edema. There is often concomitant meniscal tearing. 

• 
Avascular necrosis is primary osteonecrosis of the subchondral bone. In advanced cases, it may cause subchondral collapse. The key imaging finding is serpiginous signal abnormality of the subchondral bone. 



Synovium 
Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) 

PVNS: Lateral knee radiograph shows a dense knee effusion (red arrows) and a soft-tissue mass posterior to the knee (yellow arrows). 



• 
Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a benign hyperplastic proliferation of the synovium within the joint, now thought to represent a tumor. The same process outside of the joint is called giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath. 

• 
The knee is by far the most common location for PVNS. 

• 
PVNS presents as knee pain and swelling, with recurrent dark brown effusions from prior hemorrhage. 


Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS; continued) 
• 
PVNS most commonly diffusely affects a joint, but it may also be focal. Focal PVNS can clinically mimic internal derangement. 

• 
Recurrent hemorrhage leads to residual intra-articular hemosiderin, which is paramagnetic. The paramagnetic effects of hemosiderin cause T1 prolongation and T2 shortening, resulting in dark signal on both T1- and T2-weighted images, with blooming on gradient-echo sequences. 


Lipoma arborescens 


Lipoma arborescens: 
Coronal PD-weighted MRI without (top left image) and with fat suppression (top right image), and axial PD-weighted MRI with fat suppression demonstrate fat signal intensity globular and frond-like fatty synovial proliferation (arrows). 
• 
Lipoma arborescens is overgrowth of intracapsular synovial fatty tissue, causing lobulated and globular intra-articular fatty masses. 

• 
Lipoma arborescens is treated with synovectomy to prevent premature osteoarthritis. 



Knee soft tissues 
Baker’s cyst 
• 
Baker’s cyst is a popliteal cyst caused from a ball-valve type communication with the knee joint. 

• 
The typical location is between the semimembranosus tendon and medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle (mnemonic: Baker’s M&M). 

• 
An important differential consideration is a popliteal aneurysm. 


Tennis leg 
• Tears of either the plantaris tendon or the medial head of the gastrocnemius have both been called tennis leg.
