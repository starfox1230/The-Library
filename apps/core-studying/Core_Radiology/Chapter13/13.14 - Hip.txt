Hip 
Hip anatomy 
Bony acetabulum 
• The acetabulum is formed by the fusion of three bones: The ilium superiorly, the pubis anteriorly, and ischium posteriorly. Pediatric radiographs of the hip show the separation of these three bones, which meet at the triradiate cartilage to form the acetabulum. 

Cartilage, labrum, and ligaments 
• 
The articular surface of the acetabulum is lined by a horseshoe-shaped thin articular cartilage. The center of the acetabulum, called the pulvinar, is not covered by cartilage. 

• 
The labrum forms a fibrocartilaginous ring approximately 270 degrees around the periphery of the acetabulum. The labrum blends with the transverse ligament anterior/inferiorly. Note that there is no labrum at the anterior/ 


inferior aspect of the acetabulum 
where the transverse ligament lies. 



• The transverse ligament gives off fibers that form the ligamentum teres, which connects to the femoral head at its central fovea.

• 
The femoral head is mostly covered by articular cartilage except at the fovea capitis (central fovea), which is a central depression and attachment site of the ligamentum teres. 

• 
The greater and lesser trochanters are apophyses. The greater trochanter is the insertion site for the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus. The iliopsoas inserts on the lesser trochanter. Of note, a fracture of the lesser trochanter in an adult is considered pathologic until proven otherwise. 

• 
The iliopectineal line (also called iliopubic line) represents the border of the anterior column of the acetabulum. The ilioischial line represents the border of the posterior column of the acetabulum. 

• 
The anterior and posterior walls of the acetabulum project over the femoral head. The posterior wall is more lateral.

Acetabular fracture 
Acetabular fracture 
• 
Discontinuity of either the iliopectineal and ilioischial lines may represent a fracture of the anterior or posterior column of the acetabulum. 

• 
Classification of acetabular fractures is complex and multiple classifications have been introduced. The most widely used classification scheme is the Judet-Letournel classification, which describes 10 types of acetabular fractures. 

• 
The Judet-Letournel classification describes 5 elementary patterns: fractures of the posterior wall, posterior column, anterior wall, anterior column, and transverse fractures. Five combination patterns are also described. The Judet-Letournel types are not related to fracture complexity or prognosis. 

• 
The posterior wall of the acetabulum is the most commonly fractured element, alone or in combination with other injuries. 




Hip fracture 
Anatomy of the proximal femur 


Illustration demonstrates the vascular anatomy of the Cinematic rendering of the proximal femur with proximal femur. The main blood supply to the femoral head the main regions of the proximal femur colored. is from the medial femoral circumflex artery, a branch of The head and most of the neck (excluding the the profunda femoris artery. basicervical region) are intracapsular. 
• 
A “hip fracture” generally refers to a fracture of the proximal femur. 

• 
It is important to understand the vascular and osseous anatomy of the proximal femur in order to accurately describe hip fractures in a way that is helpful to the orthopedist. 

• 
The blood supply to the femoral head is predominantly supplied by the medial femoral circum.ex artery, which arises from the profunda femoral artery. This artery courses along the femoral neck, and if the extra-osseous branches are injured in trauma there is an increased risk of avascular necrosis of the femoral head. 

• 
Intracapsular fractures, including those of the femoral head and most fractures of the femoral neck, have increased risk for vascular disruption and therefore increased risk for avascular necrosis, in comparison to extra-capsular fractures. 


The femoral head and most of the femoral neck are intracapsular. The basicervical region is the most distal part of the femoral neck, just proximal to the intertrochanteric crest. The basicervical region is extra-capsular. Therefore, basicervical fractures generally do quite well when appropriately recognized and treated. 
• 
In addition to the basicervical region, the intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric regions are also extra-capsular. 

• 
Although there are many classifications for various regions of proximal femur fractures in the orthopedic literature, these have shown to have generally poor inter-reader agreement. Instead, a simplified classification as proposed in this text can concisely describe the relevant findings and accurately predict the appropriate treatment. 


Hip dislocation and femoral head fractures 

Frontal radiograph of the pelvis Axial CT 
Posterior hip dislocation, with femoral head fracture and posterior acetabular wall fracture: 
Frontal radiograph of the pelvis shows a right posterior hip dislocation, with the femoral head displaced in the typical superior position. Note internal rotation of the femur, with obscuration of the lesser trochanter (yellow arrow). There is a posterior acetabular fracture (red arrow), partially obscured by the trauma board artifact. 
CT confirms a small posterior acetabular wall fracture (red arrow) and a small femoral head fracture in the region of the fovea (blue arrow). 
• The vast majority (~90%) of hip fractures are due to high-energy trauma with posterior displacement of the femur, which is typically positioned superiorly. 
The femur is typically positioned in internal rotation and flexion. The internal rotation of the femur causes decreased conspicuity of the lesser trochanter, which is rotated behind the medial femoral cortex. The dislocated femoral head may appear smaller than the normal side due to AP radiographic technique 
and magnification effect. 
• Femoral head fractures are most commonly associated with posterior hip dislocations or gunshot wounds. Isolated femoral head fractures are uncommon. 
Overview of proximal femur fractures 
• Excepting femoral head fractures, proximal femur fractures can be divided into 4 sites: Femoral neck (intracapsular); and basicervical, intertrochanteric, and 
- Displaced/varus angulated • Femoral neck fractures can be nondisplaced (equivalent to valgus impaction) or displaced (equivalent 
- Nondisplaced/valgus impacted 

Femoral neck: subtrochanteric (extracapsular). 
Intertrochanteric: 
to varus). 
• Intertrochanteric fractures can 
be stable (single fracture line) or unstable. 
Imaging of hip fracture 
• The initial evaluation of hip trauma should begin with radiographs, including a frontal view of the pelvis and a cross-table lateral radiograph of the affected hip. 
Frog-leg lateral radiographs (commonly performed for arthritis assessment) should generally not be performed for trauma, as there is a potential to cause fracture displacement.  
• 
If a hip fracture is clearly identified on radiography and able to be classified (as subsequently discussed), then there is generally no need for additional cross-sectional imaging. 

• 
An “occult” hip fracture is a fracture that is not evident on radiographs. Occult fractures may be present in up to 10% of apparently negative radiographs performed for trauma. Therefore, further imaging with CT or MRI should be performed if there is persistent concern for fracture with negative radiographs. 



Frontal radiograph Coronal CT 
Occult fracture, evident on CT. Radiograph is negative. Coronal CT demonstrates a nondisplaced (stable) intertrochanteric fracture (arrow). 

Frontal radiograph Coronal T1-weighted MRI 
Occult fracture, evident on MRI (different patient from above). Radiograph is negative. MRI demonstrates a nondisplaced femoral neck fracture (arrows). 
MRI is the gold standard to diagnose occult hip fracture, with a sensitivity of essentially 100%. However, CT is cheaper, faster, more readily available, less susceptible to motion, and without known contra-indications. Two meta-analyses showed that CT has a sensitivity of 79–94% for detecting occult 
hip fracture. Therefore, CT may be reasonable if MRI is not readily available but MRI remains the gold standard. Dual energy CT shows promise as an emerging modality to improve the sensitivity of CT. 

Femoral neck fracture (intracapsular) 

Valgus impacted femoral neck fracture: 
Frontal radiograph shows a fracture of the femoral neck (arrows) with the distal part of the femur directed laterally, consistent with valgus. 
This fracture was treated with ORIF. 
Varus displaced femoral neck fracture (different patient from above): 
Frontal radiograph shows a fracture of the femoral neck (arrows) with the distal part of the femur directed medially, consistent with varus. 
This fracture was treated with arthroplasty. 
• 
Femoral neck fractures are typically seen in the elderly after low-energy trauma. 

• 
Femoral neck fractures are intracapsular, and therefore at risk to develop avascular necrosis. 

• 
The orthopedic classifications include Garden and Pauwel, although these are not in common use clinically. The specific site of the femoral neck (such as subcapital or transcervical) does not affect treatment and does not need to be mentioned. 

• 
Intracapsular femoral neck fractures can be nondisplaced (valgus impaction is considered nondisplaced for treatment decisions) or displaced (varus angulation is considered displaced). 


Nondisplaced (valgus impacted) fractures can be treated with ORIF, which is a less invasive procedure 
compared to arthroplasty. Displaced (varus impacted) fractures are typically treated with arthroplasty (in active community ambulators) or hemiarthroplasy (in less active or debilitated patients) in older patients. Although femoral neck fractures are uncommon in younger patients, ORIF would be the preferred treatment in an attempt to preserve the joint. 
Basicervical fracture 

Basicervical fracture: Frontal radiograph (left image) demonstrates a basicervical fracture (arrows), located just proximal to the intertrochanteric crest. Despite being displaced, this was able to be treated with ORIF with a dynamic hip screw (right image). 
• Basicervical fractures are a relatively uncommon type of femoral neck fracture that occurs just distal to the joint capsule. Being extracapsular, they have a lower risk of avascular necrosis and can be successfully treated with ORIF (typically with a dynamic hip screw), regardless of if displaced or nondisplaced. 
Greater trochanter 
Coronal CT demonstrates an apparently tiny fracture of the greater trochanter (arrow). 
MRI shows the true extent of the fracture, with edema (red arrows) extending greater than 50% of the distance through the intertrochanteric region. 
The patient was treated surgically based on clinical exam and MRI findings with ORIF (same treatment pathway as a stable intertrochanteric fracture). 

• Greater trochanter fractures can be thought of as the “tip of the iceberg” fracture, as the true extent of the fracture often extends well beyond the greater trochanter. In fact, it is likely that the majority of these fractures are actually intertrochanteric fractures with the intertrochanteric portion occult on radiography. 
Intertrochanteric fracture 


• 
Intertrochanteric fractures are treated differently depending if they are stable or unstable. 

• 
A stable fracture is one that is a simple, two-part fracture without comminution or involvement of the lateral femoral cortex. Stable fractures can be treated with a dynamic hip screw. 

• 
An unstable fracture is comminuted or involves the lateral femoral cortex. Unstable fractures are typically treated with an intramedullary nail. 

• 
Of note, a fracture isolated to the lesser trochanter in an adult should be considered pathologic until proven otherwise (adolescents may traumatically avulse the lesser trochanter, which is the attachment site of the strong iliopsoas muscle). 



lesser trochanter (arrows), with permeative margins. CT confirms a permeative lesion (red arrows). 

Subtrochanteric fracture 
• A subtrochanteric fracture is a proximal diaphyseal fracture involving the subtrochanteric region, which extends from the level of the lesser trochanter to 5 cm distal to the lesser trochanter. Treatment is intramedullary nail (similar to unstable intertrochanteric fracture). 
Femoral neck stress fracture 

Femoral neck stress fracture involving the medial Femoral neck stress fracture involving the lateral femoral neck: femoral neck: 
Coronal STIR MRI demonstrates edema of the medial Coronal STIR MRI demonstrates edema of the lateral aspect of the femoral neck with a small fracture line aspect of the femoral neck (arrow), as well as some (arrow). medial-sided edema. 
• 
Femoral neck stress fractures are typically seen in highly active patients. The female athlete triad is restrictive/disordered eating, menstrual dysfunction, and low bone density, and these individuals are at higher risk for stress fractures. 

• 
Stress fractures of the medial cortex are under compressive forces and tend to heal with cessation of the offending physical activity. 

• 
In contrast, stress fractures of the lateral femoral cortex are under tensile (pulling) forces, and are treated more aggressively, with weightbearing restrictions and sometimes surgery. 

• 
Imaging initially shows edema, with discrete fracture line in more advanced cases. 


Atypical femoral fracture 



Atypical femoral fracture (continued) 
• 
Atypical femoral fractures are a form of insufficiency fracture that occur in the proximal lateral femoral diaphyseal cortex, typically the subtrochanteric region (defined as extending from the lesser trochanter to 5 cm distal). 

• 
Atypical fractures are caused by insufficient osteoclastic-induced remodeling, resulting in a brittle bone more susceptible to fracture. 

• 
Atypical femoral fractures are most known to occur in patients taking bisphosphonates (which inhibit osteoclasts), but can also occur in patients on denosumab (a monoclonal antibody that inhibits osteoclast maturation) or in patients without these medications. 

• 
The American Society of Bone and Mineral Research defined 5 major features, of which 4 of the 5 must be present to diagnose an atypical femoral fracture: 


No more than minimal trauma. Substantially transverse orientation. Must involve lateral cortex if incomplete; if complete may demonstrate a “medial spike.” No more than minimally comminuted. Endosteal or periosteal thickening laterally. 
• 
When an atypical femoral fracture is identified, radiographs of the contralateral femur should be performed, as these fractures are bilateral in a substantial minority of patients. 

• 
Treatment could include cessation of the offending medication if appropriate, and intramedullary nailing in some patients, especially if that patient has pain. 


Avascular necrosis (AVN) 

Frontal radiograph shows subtle patchy subchondral sclerosis of both femoral heads (yellow arrows), with subtle irregularity of the subchondral bone plate (the “cortex” overlying the cartilage) on the left (red arrow). 

Coronal T1-weighted MRI shows serpiginous regions of signal abnormality involving the subchondral bone of both femoral heads (yellow arrows). There is irregularity and undulating contour of the subchondral bone plate on the left (red arrow), and with extensive edema (low signal intensity on this T1-weighted MR) asymmetrically involving the left (blue arrow). 

Avascular necrosis (AVN; continued) 
• 
Avascular necrosis (AVN) is focal ischemia of the epiphyseal region or subchondral bone. AVN leads to trabecular necrosis, which increases susceptibility to subchondral collapse, and secondary osteoarthritis if untreated. The more general term osteonecrosis indicates necrosis of bone and marrow elements. 

• 
The femoral head is especially susceptible to AVN because of precarious blood supply. The blood supply to the femoral head is primarily through the medial femoral circumflex artery, which enters the femoral neck and gives off posterosuperior epiphyseal branches that course along the femoral neck to supply the femoral head. 

• 
As previous discussed, intracapsular proximal femur fractures have a high risk of AVN, including femoral neck fractures in the elderly and transient subluxation in athletes. 

• 
Non-traumatic causes of AVN are usually systemic, including red-cell abnormalities (e.g., sickle cell disease), abnormalities of marrow packing (e.g., Gaucher disease), or secondary effects of medications including steroids, alcohol, or immunosuppression from transplant. Systemic causes of AVN tend to be bilateral. 


A clue to the presence of Gaucher disease is splenomegaly with AVN. A clue to the presence of sickle cell is a small calcified spleen with AVN. 
• 
It is optimal to diagnose AVN prior to subchondral collapse and secondary osteoarthritis. Early AVN can be treated with medication/lifestyle changes and/or core decompression (drilling of the subchondral bone, with the goal to reduce intraosseous pressure). Once subchondral collapse and secondary osteoarthritis are present, treatment is generally arthroplasty. 

• 
Several staging systems have been proposed for the radiographic and MRI classification of AVN; however, from a practical standpoint the relative size of the AVN, status of the subchondral bone plate (the “cortex” overlying the cartilage), and presence of secondary osteoarthritis are helpful imaging findings to describe. 

• 
The most common appearance of AVN on MRI is a geographic subchondral lesion outlined by a serpentine low signal rim on T1-weighted images. The subchondral anterior-superior portions of the femoral head, at 10 o’clock and 2 o’clock on coronal images, are typical locations. 

• 
The double line sign is seen on T2-weighted MRI and is comprised of a peripheral low-intensity rim and an inner high-intensity band. The double line sign is thought to be pathognomonic for AVN. 

• 
Bone marrow edema is present in 50% and clinically correlates with pain. 


Transient bone marrow edema (TBME) 
• 
Transient bone marrow edema (TBME), also called transient osteoporosis of the hip, is a controversial entity that is a diagnosis of exclusion and may actually reflect a combination of disorders including sympathetic nervous system overactivity, stress fracture, or transient ischemia. 

• 
The traditional teaching is that TBME is a self-limited clinical entity lasting a few months. It is characterized by severe hip pain in young to middle-aged adults (more commonly men, although it was first described in women in the third trimester of pregnancy). 

• 
Radiographs show regional osteopenia in the femoral head without any secondary signs of arthritis. MRI shows edema throughout the femoral head. 

• 
As TBME may be a wastebasket diagnosis, it is essential to always evaluate for subtle lesions to explain these findings. For instance, a subchondral hypointense line on T1-weighted images may represent a fracture, or a small focus of AVN may be apparent. 




Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) 
Overview and controversy of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) 
• Femoroacetabular impingement normal cam-type FAI (FAI) is abnormal abutment of 
the femur with the acetabulum at 
extremes of range of motion. 

• 
Two types of impingement have been described, depending if the femoral head/neck junction (cam­type) or the acetabulum (pincer­type) is abnormal. 

• 
Chronic microtrauma of the 


femoral head abutting against the acetabulum may cause acetabular pincer-type FAI mixed-type FAI labral tears in young athletic individuals and may accelerate the development of hip osteoarthritis. 
• 
While FAI may be an important cause of hip osteoarthritis in young patients, there is controversy as to whether a diagnosis of impingement can be made based on the imaging findings in the absence of the clinical syndrome. 

• 
Impingement is primarily a clinical diagnosis and there is a significant subset of patients with abnormal morphology of the acetabulum or femoral head/neck junction who are asymptomatic. 

• 
Labral injury secondary to FAI (typically occurring in the anterosuperior labrum) is often associated with underlying chondral injury as well. 

• 
Regardless of the controversy, FAI is an important concept to be aware of in the young adult. A general consensus is that imaging findings suggestive of FAI should be described with the disclaimer that these findings may predispose to impingement in the presence of pain. 



Cam-type impingement 
• 
Cam-type impingement, characterized by an osseous convexity of the femoral head/neck junction, is most common in young athletic males. 

• 
The alpha angle defines the degree of femoral bump. An alpha angle is measured on oblique axial MRI or CT. An alpha angle of >55 degrees is said to be abnormal, especially if symptoms of hip impingement are present. Of note, there is a relatively high prevalence of asymptomatic individuals with elevated alpha angles. 






Cam-type impingement (continued) 
• To measure the alpha angle, a line through the femoral neck bisecting the center of the femoral head is interfaced with a second line which runs from the center of the femoral head to the most proximal abnormal contour of the femoral head/neck. 

This is the same patient as pictured on the previous page. 

Post-arthrogram axial-oblique T1-weighted MRI with fat suppression demonstrates an osseous convexity at the femoral head/neck junction (red arrow), with an elevated alpha angle. 
• Cam-type impingement is treated with femoroplasty. 
Pincer-type impingement 
• 
Pincer-type FAI is caused by overcoverage of the acetabulum, and is more common in middle-aged females. However, most cases of hip impingement are due to both pincer-type and CAM-type. 

• 
The crossover sign (also called cranial acetabular retroversion) is seen in pincer-type FAI and represents the superior aspect of the anterior acetabular wall crossing over the posterior acetabular wall on a frontal radiograph. 


normal anterior overcoverage: crossover sign 


Illustration of the left acetabulum as seen on a radiograph demonstrates a comparison between the normal anterior and posterior acetabulum, and in anterior overcoverage. 
In anterior overcoverage, there is crossover of the anterior and posterior acetabulum. 

• Treatment of pincer-type FAI is surgical trimming of the acetabular rim. 


Acetabular labral tear 

Intrasubstance labral tearing: Sagittal (left image) and axial MR arthrogram images show a markedly diminutive and irregular anterior/superior labrum (arrows), in keeping with intrasubstance tearing. 

Chondrolabral junction tearing (different patient from above): Sagittal (left image) and axial MR arthrogram images show contrast interposed between the entire width (arrows) of the anterior superior labrum and the acetabulum. 
• 
Labral tears are seen most commonly in the setting of FAI, with the anterior-superior labrum typically involved. Labral tears are challenging to detect, given the curved morphology of the labrum. Note that there is no labral tissue inferiorly; instead, the transverse ligament is located at the inferior aspect of the ring comprising the labrum. 

• 
MR arthrography is the most sensitive imaging modality to diagnose acetabular labral tears; however, both conventional MR and MR arthrography have similar high specificity. 

• 
Labral tears can conceptually be divided into two types: tears at the chondrolabral junction, where the labrum is lifted off the cartilage; and tears involving the substance of the labrum. 

• 
Secondary findings of labral tearing include paralabral cyst formation, chondral injury, and subchondral edema, all of which may be present with normal radiographs. Additionally, typical osteoarthritic changes such as osteophytes and subchondral cysts may be more apparent on MRI compared to radiographs. 

• 
There are several normal variants that may mimic labral tears. Perhaps the most challenging to differentiate is a sublabral sulcus, which is an incomplete attachment of the labrum to the acetabulum. In contrast to a tear, injected contrast would not extend the entire width of the labrum, and no secondary degenerative changes would be present.
