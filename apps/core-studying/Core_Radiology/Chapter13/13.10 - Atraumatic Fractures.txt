Atraumatic fractures 
• 
Atraumatic fractures are bone injury caused by a mechanism other than a single traumatic episode. Atraumatic fractures may be due to underlying abnormal bone (as in insufficiency fracture, atypical fracture, or pathologic fracture), or the bone may be normal (as seen in fatigue fracture). 

• 
Fragility fractures are traumatic fractures in an elderly patient with osteoporosis (and often sarcopenia), caused by a low-velocity mechanism that would not normally be expected to cause fracture in a patient with normal bone mineral density or muscle mass. 


Terminology of atraumatic fractures 
Stress fracture: Terminology 

• By strict definition, the term stress fracture encompasses both fatigue fractures and insufficiency fractures. These are fractures due to summation of repetitive forces, which overwhelm the bone remodeling pathway. 
A fatigue fracture is injury of a normal bone caused by repetitive submaximal force, often described with 
the maxim “abnormal stress on normal bone.” An insufficiency fracture is injury of an abnormal bone, weakened through a metabolic process (most commonly but not necessary osteoporosis). In other words, “normal stress on abnormal bone.” 
• 
The above terminology is often confusing. Clinically, the term stress fracture is usually considered synonymous with fatigue fracture. Also, there is substantial clinical and imaging overlap between fatigue and insufficiency fractures, and there is no clear cutoff between “normal” and “abnormal” stress or “normal” and “abnormal” bones. For these reasons, the term fatigue fracture is not commonly used. This text will use stress fracture and fatigue fracture synonymously to be consistent with the majority of the literature. However, the term insu.ciency fracture is usually reserved for older individuals. 

• 
The term bone stress injury refers to the spectrum of injury seen in stress fractures. This is subsequently discussed and may range from periosteal reaction in early stages, bone marrow edema in mid-grade injuries, to cortical fracture in more advanced stages. 

• 
An atypical fracture is a special type of insufficiency fracture, only occurring in the lateral cortex of the proximal-to-mid femur, subsequently discussed. 


Pathologic fracture: Defi nition 
• A pathologic fracture is a fracture through a focal lesion. The lesion is most commonly a neoplasm (may be benign or malignant), or less commonly through a region of osteomyelitis.
