Musculoskeletal interventions 
Arthrography 
General principals 
• 
Arthrography can be performed for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. 

• 
In diagnostic arthrography, contrast is injected into the joint to assess the intra-articular structures, such as cartilage, menisci, labra, ligaments, and to evaluate for intra-articular bodies. Post-arthrogram MR or CT is almost always performed. 


For MR arthrography, a 1:100 or 1:200 dilution of gadolinium-containing contrast is made. For instance, 
0.1 mL of gadolinium contrast diluted in 10 mL of normal saline is a 1:100 dilution. This can be admixed with iodinated contrast (at our institution in a 1:1 ratio) to be visualized under fluoroscopy. Alternatively,  the gadolinium-saline mixture can be injected after a test injection of iodinated contrast to confirm intra-articular position. 
• 
For therapeutic joint injections, steroid and anesthetic medications are injected into the joint under imaging guidance (fluoroscopy, ultrasound, or rarely CT). Steroids are thought to reduce pain by reducing intra-articular inflammation but do not change the course of osteoarthritis, and several recent studies have questioned their effectiveness. Therapeutic injections should be limited to once every six months or once every three months in cases of debilitating pain with prior effective steroid injection. 

• 
Complications of any arthrogram could include infection, hematoma formation, allergic reaction, or mechanical injury from the needle to structures such as tendons, menisci/labra, ligaments, and cartilage. 

• 
Additional steroid-specific complications could include progression of osteoarthritis/ subchondral collapse from steroid administration, and systemic steroid side effects (e.g., elevated blood glucose, increased appetite, insomnia). 

• 
Local anesthetic is toxic to chondrocytes ex-vivo. Ropivacaine is thought to be the least chondrotoxic, and bupivacaine the most chondrotoxic. 

• 
There are many variations on safe procedures to perform arthrography, but a few steps 


should always be performed: Patient consent. Procedural time-out: confirming identification, procedure, laterality, and allergies. Skin marking. Sterile preparation and maintenance of sterile field throughout procedure. At least one image showing intra-articular contrast should be saved. 
• In patients allergic to iodinated contrast, air or gadolinium can be used. 
Dose reduction in fluoroscopic procedures 
• 
One should always maintain the ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principle for radiation exposure in fluoroscopic procedures. 

• 
Decrease the imaging parameters, by reducing the mA and kVp as low as possible. Many fluoroscopic machines have a “low-dose” mode that should be utilized routinely unless there is a specific reason to turn it off (such as tricky anatomy or unclear pattern of contrast opacification). 

• 
Decrease the number of images taken. This can be done in three ways: by taking fewer images, by pressing the pedal only briefly, and by reducing the frames obtained per second. This last method is often called “pulse” mode, which should always be used unless there is a specific problem-solving need. 


Dose reduction in fluoroscopic procedures (continued) 
• 
Decrease the source-to-image distance. The image intensifier (II) should always be as close to the patient as feasible. It is ok to “ride” the II up and down during the procedure, in order to best reduce source-to-image distance while maintaining sufficient space to work. 

• 
Cone-in the image as much as possible. Once the basic anatomy is seen on the initial images, there is no need to image the full field of view every time. This is especially important for hip arthrography, where the pelvic sidewalls may be repeatedly radiated. 

• 
Make it fun! It’s a friendly competition to play to see who can get the lowest dose, as long as the procedure is done safely, accurately, and with minimal discomfort to the patient. 


Shoulder 

Normal shoulder arthrogram: Initial image (left image) demonstrates ideal BB marker placement (arrow) for a “rotator interval” approach, at the upper inner quadrant of the humeral head. A fluoroscopic image should be obtained after initial injection of contrast (middle image). Post-procedure image demonstrates normal contrast filling the joint, without contrast extravasation into the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa. 
• 
Similar to hip arthrography, diagnostic and therapeutic shoulder injections are very common. For diagnostic arthrography, a total intra-articular volume of 10–12 mL is typically injected. 

• 
Communication of the glenohumeral joint with the subacromial/subdeltoid bursa indicates a full-thickness rotator cuff tear (presuming that there is no history of prior surgery). 


Hip 
• 
Diagnostic hip MR arthrography is commonly performed to assess for labral tears and chondral injury. A total intra-articular volume of 10–12 mL is typically administered. 

• 
Therapeutic hip injections are commonly performed to reduce osteoarthritis-related pain and inflammation. 




Wrist 
• 
For diagnostic wrist injections, approximately 3 mL of injectate is administered. Injecting more contrast can increase the chance of contrast extravasating out of the joint, which can complicate image interpretation. 

• 
It is important to inject the contrast under real-time fluoroscopy to visualize any abnormal communication between the radiocarpal compartment (where contrast is injected) and either the distal radioulnar joint or the mid-carpal space. 

• 
Communication between radiocarpal compartment and distal radioulnar joint indicates a tear of the TFC (with an example provided in the “Wrist” section of this chapter). 

• 
Communication between the radiocarpal compartment and the midcarpal space demonstrates tears of either the scapholunate or lunotriquetral ligaments. 




biopsy 
Basic principles of bone and soft tissue biopsy 
• 
Indications for biopsy include need for pathologic diagnosis of an indeterminate or aggressive lesion, confirmation of and/or molecular analysis of suspected metastatic disease, and need for microbial analysis in imaging-confirmed osteomyelitis. 

• 
It is important to perform a thorough imaging workup prior to biopsy planning, in order to best determine the pre-test probability, target the highest yield portion of the lesion, and avoid unnecessary biopsy. 


As an example of the importance of risk-stratifying lesions on imaging prior to biopsy, if complete imaging workup showed an aggressive-appearing lesion with FDG uptake on PET, then a negative or nondiagnostic pathology report would not be concordant, and repeat biopsy should be performed. 
In contrast, if complete imaging assessment showed an indeterminate but less-aggressive appearing lesion (such as with minimal enhancement and no or low-level uptake on PET), then an indeterminate pathology report could possibly be followed by short-interval repeat imaging. 
• 
Absolute contraindications are not common but include an inaccessible percutaneous approach, and need to traverse a soft tissue infection to target a non-infected lesion. 

• 
Close consultation with orthopedic oncologists is required when planning biopsy approach, especially for solitary lesions that may ultimately be resected. This collaborative planning ensures that the biopsy tract can be resected at time of surgery and reduces the risk of tumor tract seeding and contamination of additional compartments. 


Special considerations 
• 
For thigh biopsies (bone or soft tissues), it is critical not to traverse the rectus femoris muscle (unless a lesion of the rectus femoris is being targeted). This is because rectus is one of the primary extensors of the leg traversing both the hip and knee joints, and if it is traversed the rectus may need to be sacrificed to reduce the chance of tumor tract seeding. 

• 
For biopsy of weight-bearing bones of the lower extremity (such as the femur or tibia), it may be necessary for the patient to be on crutches with touch-down weight-bearing, in consultation with the treating orthopedic surgeon. 


Soft tissue biopsies 

Soft tissue biopsy: Contrast-enhanced MRI shows a heterogeneously enhancing mass in the adductor compartment of the left thigh (arrows). Pre-procedural color Doppler ultrasound demonstrates the mass, with no vascularity along the expected needle tract. Intraprocedural image (right image) demonstrates the biopsy needle (arrow) in the center of the mass. Pathology was a cellular myxoma. 
• 
Soft tissue mass biopsies are generally performed with a coaxial spring-loaded biopsy device. For highest yield, the most avidly enhancing portion (or most avid focus of FDG uptake if a PET was performed) should be targeted as long as it is safe to do so. 

• 
The majority of musculoskeletal soft tissue biopsies can be performed by ultrasound, although CT is often a reasonable modality as well. 


Bone biopsies 


Planning CT image with grid (top left image),  with patient prone. The mixed lytic and sclerotic lesion (arrows) of the left iliac bone was targeted. 
Intraprocedural CT-fluoroscopic image (top right image) shows the bone biopsy device progressing towards the lesion. The lesion is obscured by streak and beam hardening artifact. 
Intraprocedural CT-fluoroscopic image (left image) shows the coaxial biopsy device traversing the region of the lesion, although the lesion is obscured. Careful correlation of landmarks is necessary in this case. Pathology was metastatic breast cancer. 
• 
Most bone biopsies are performed with CT guidance. Lesions that are occult on CT but apparent on MR can generally be targeted by CT using landmarks. MR-guided biopsy may also be performed in suitable cases. 

• 
Similar to fluoroscopic interventions, patient dose should be maintained as low as reasonably achievable. A major contribution to patient dose is the initial planning CT with the grid. This should be performed in a dose-reduced manner, if possible. Intraprocedural CT-fluoroscopy generally yields lower patient dose compared to spiral CT acquisitions. 

• 
To reduce operator dose during CT fluoroscopy, take a step back and stand behind in the wings of the CT gantry. Operator dose is 100 times less in this location compared to the standard location standing next to the patient at the opening of the CT gantry. 

• 
There are several manual and battery-powered drill devices available. 

• 
Lucent lesions generally have higher diagnostic yield than sclerotic lesions. 

• 
Similar to targeting of soft tissue biopsies, the most avidly enhancing component or region of highest FDG uptake should be targeted, as long as it is safe to do so. 


Vertebral biopsies 
• The safest approach to biopsy a vertebral body is transpedicular, where the biopsy needle traverses the pedicle. The bony walls of the pedicle protect the needle from inadvertently traversing the spinal canal. 
Biopsies for osteomyelitis 
• 
The sensitivity of biopsy for diagnosing osteomyelitis is highly variable in the literature, but in general it is quite low. 

• 
Therefore, biopsy should not be performed to diagnose osteomyelitis in equivocal cases. Rather, it is useful to obtain microbial cultures and sensitivities when imaging already confirms osteomyelitis.
