Basics of MRI 
Tendons 
• A normal tendon is dark on all MRI sequences. 
Magic angle artifact 

Sagittal STIR MRI Sagittal STIR MRI 

Axial PD-weighted MRI Axial PD-weighted MRI (slightly more caudal) 
Magic angle artifact: Note the normal low signal intensity of the peroneus longus (yellow arrows) and peroneus brevis (red arrows) tendons on the left-most axial PD image, corresponding to the level indicated by the dashed orange line in the sagittal STIR image directly above. An image slightly lower (right images) shows apparent “gray” or intermediate signal intensity due to magic angle artifact. 
• A normal tendon may have artifactually increased signal due to the magic angle phenomenon. Because tendons have fibers coursing along a single direction (demonstrating anisotropy), tendons may demonstrate artifactually increased signal on short TE sequences when oriented 55 degrees relative to the bore of the magnet. This phenomenon is called the magic angle artifact. 
Short TE sequences include T1-weighted and proton density images. T2-weighted sequences are less susceptible to the magic angle artifact. Unlike true tendon pathology, the magic angle artifact disappears with a long TE and the tendon will 
otherwise have a normal morphology.

Tenosynovitis 

Tenosynovitis: 
Large amount of fluid (arrows) circumferentially surrounds the posterior tibial tendon on this axial T2-weighted MRI with fat suppression. 
• 
Tenosynovitis is inflammation surrounding a tendon. Tenosynovitis may be secondary to repetitive motion, inflammatory arthritis, or infection. 

• 
On MRI, fluid completely surrounds the tendon circumferentially. 

• 
A potential pitfall is that fluid can track along tendon sheaths that communicate directly with an adjacent joint (such as the long head of the biceps tendon in the shoulder or the flexor hallucis longus tendon in the ankle). This should not be confused with tenosynovitis, unless the degree of tenosynovial fluid is out of proportion to a relatively smaller amount of joint fluid. 

• 
A variant form, called stenosing tenosynovitis, features several loculated collections of fluid in the tendon sheath. 


Stenosing tenosynovitis can be seen surrounding the flexor hallucis longus tendon at the medial ankle in os trigonum syndrome and about the wrist in de Quervain’s stenosing tenosynovitis. 
Myxoid degeneration (tendinosis) 
• Aging or overuse often leads to myxoid degeneration, which is clinically synonymous with 
tendinitis, tendinopathy, and tendinosis. The word tendinitis should not be used as myxoid degeneration is not due to inflammation. 
• MRI will show intermediate intra-substance (within the tendon) signal on both T1- and T2-weighted images. The tendon may be either normal or enlarged. These findings are nonspecific and can be seen in both myxoid degeneration and partial tear. These two entities often coexist and imaging cannot distinguish between the two. 

Tendon tear 
• 
A partial tendon tear represents incomplete disruption of the fibers and can have a varied MRI appearance. The tendon may be thickened, thinned, or contain intra-substance fluid. 

• 
A full-thickness, full-width disruption of the tendon will appear as complete discontinuity of the tendon. There is often retraction of the tendon remnants.
