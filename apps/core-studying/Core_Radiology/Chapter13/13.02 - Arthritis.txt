Arthritis 
• 
The hallmark of arthritis is cartilage destruction, which may be evident on radiographs as joint space narrowing. 

• 
In broad categories, arthritis can be divided into degenerative (osteoarthritis), inflammatory (rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathies, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis), crystal deposition (gout, calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate, and hydroxyapatite), hematologic (hemophilia), and metabolic categories. 


Osteoarthritis (OA) 
Overview of osteoarthritis 
• 
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the result of articular cartilage breakdown from altered local mechanical factors in a susceptible individual. In addition to cartilage, OA involves the entire joint including bone, ligaments, menisci, joint capsule, synovium, and musculature. 

• 
OA is the most common cause of cartilage loss in the middle-aged and older population. 

• 
OA typically occurs in weight-bearing joints and the hands in a specific distribution. 

• 
When OA is present in younger patients or in unusual locations, such as the shoulder, elbow, or ankle, then there is usually prior trauma or other underlying arthritis. 

• 
Imaging findings of osteoarthritis: 

• 
Although joint space narrowing is present in all arthritides, osteoarthritis can be diagnosed with confidence when subchondral sclerosis, osteophytes, and subchondral cystic changes are present, erosions are absent, and periarticular osteopenia is absent. 


Radiograph and CT findings  MRI findings  
Osteophytes. Subchondral cystic change, due to herniation of joint fluid into bone through a cartilage defect. Sclerosis of subchondral bone, due to reactive remodeling. Lack of periarticular osteopenia.  Osteophytes. Subchondral cystic change. Subchondral edema, due to inflammatory and reactive changes. Synovitis, with thickened, irregular, and hyperenhancing synovium.  

Osteoarthritis in the hand 
• 
Similar to osteoarthritis of other joints, the radiographic hallmarks of OA in the hand include cartilage space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophytosis. Erosions are absent. 

• 
In order of decreasing involvement, sites of OA in the hand include the distal interphalangeal joints (DIPs), the first carpometacarpal joint (CMC), and the proximal interphalangeal joints (PIPs). 

• 
Unlike rheumatoid arthritis, the metacarpophalangeal joints (MCPs) are less commonly affected. 

• 
Large osteophytes cause characteristic soft-tissue swelling 


surrounding the finger joints. A Heberden node is soft-tissue swelling around the DIP. A Bouchard node is soft-tissue swelling around the PIP. 


Erosive osteoarthritis of the hands 
• 
Typically affects elderly females, erosive OA combines the clinical findings of rheumatoid arthritis (e.g., swelling) with imaging findings and distribution that are more similar to conventional OA. 

• 
Erosions are the distinguishing imaging feature to differentiate erosive from conventional OA. The distribution of erosive OA is limited to the hands, where it most commonly involves the DIPs. 

• 
Erosive OA features a characteristic gull-wing appearance of the DIP joint due to central 


Erosive osteoarthritis: Magnified radiograph of 
erosion and marginal osteophytes. 
a digit demonstrates characteristic gull-wing appearance of the DIP (yellow arrows). 

Osteoarthritis in the shoulder 
• The Grashey view (obtained posteriorly in 40° obliqued external rotation) shows the glenohumeral joint in profile and best demonstrates cartilage space narrowing. 

Osteoarthritis in the foot 
• 
The most common joint affected by OA in the foot is the metatarsophalangeal joint (MTP) of the great toe, which may lead to hallux rigidus (a stiff big toe). 

• 
Osteoarthritis also affects the talonavicular joint and is a cause of dorsal beaking. 


Osteoarthritis in the knee 


Osteoarthritis: Standing frontal radiograph of the knee shows severe cartilage space narrowing, sclerosis, and osteophytosis of the medial tibiofemoral compartment (arrows). 
• 
There are three joint compartments in the knee: The medial and lateral tibiofemoral compartments and the patellofemoral compartment. The typical pattern for OA of the knee is asymmetrical involvement of the medial tibiofemoral compartment. Severe osteoarthritis can involve all three compartments. 

• 
Osteophytes determine if OA is present. The degree of joint space narrowing determines the severity of OA. 

• 
The degree of tibiofemoral cartilage space narrowing is best determined on standing weight-bearing views, often on standing films in slight flexion. 

• 
Bilateral involvement of the knees is typical.

• 
Similar to the knee, the involvement of hip osteoarthritis tends to be bilateral. 

• 
In addition to the typical features of OA including joint space narrowing, osteophytes, subchondral cystic change, and sclerosis, hip OA also features characteristic superolateral cartilage space narrowing. Less commonly, medial or axial (concentric) cartilage space loss can be seen in hip OA. 

• 
Note that axial cartilage space loss is the typical pattern in rheumatoid arthritis; however, since osteoarthritis is far more common than rheumatoid arthritis, axial cartilage space narrowing with osteophytes is more likely to represent osteoarthritis rather than rheumatoid arthritis. If axial cartilage space loss is seen without osteophytes, rheumatoid arthritis is more likely. 



Degenerative change in the spine 
• 
The vertebral body-disc articulations are cartilaginous joints. Vertebral body endplates are covered by hyaline cartilage that is analogous to articular cartilage in other joints. The intervertebral disc-endplate complex is composed of three components: The annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus (which together make up the disc), and the cartilaginous endplates. 

• 
Osteoarthritis affects synovial joints. Therefore, osteoarthritis in the spine can occur at the facet (zygapophyseal), atlantoaxial, uncovertebral joints (in the cervical spine at C3–C7), costovertebral, and sacroiliac joints. Osteoarthritis does not involve the disc-endplates. 

• 
The spectrum of intervertebral disc and endplate degeneration is characterized by dessication and eventual collapse of the intervertebral discs, endplate sclerosis and remodeling, and osteophyte formation. This process is best thought of as a chronic response to injury, rather than an acquired disease, and the term discovertebral degeneration is more accurate than the informal phrase degenerative disc disease. Detailed MR-based discussion of degenerative spine can be found in the “Spine” chapter. 

• 
Gas in the intervertebral disc, also called vacuum phenomenon, is commonly seen and is pathognomonic for degenerative change. 


It is important not to confuse vacuum phenomenon (gas in intervertebral disc) with Kümmell disease, which is gas in a vertebral body compression fracture representing osteonecrosis. 

Vacuum phenomenon in disc degeneration. Kmell disease: Gas in vertebral body compression fracture. 
Two patients demonstrating vacuum phenomenon versus Kümmell disease. 
Sagittal CT of the lumbar spine (left image) shows multilevel disc degeneration with intervertebral disc space narrowing and vacuum phenomena (yellow arrows). 
Sagittal CT of the lumbar spine in a different patient (right image) shows gas within the L1 vertebral body compression fracture (red arrow), indicative of osteonecrosis/vertebral body collapse (Kümmell disease). 
• 
Complications of discovertebral degeneration include spinal stenosis, neural foraminal stenosis, and degenerative spondylolisthesis. 

• 
Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a distinct entity from degenerative disc disease, but appears similar due to exuberant osteophytosis. DISH is defined as flowing bridging anterior osteophytes spanning at least 4 vertebral levels, with normal disc spaces and sacroiliac joints. The etiology of DISH is unknown. It is usually asymptomatic but may be a cause of dysphagia when it affects the cervical spine. DISH occurs in elderly patients. 


DISH is associated with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), which may be a cause of spinal stenosis. OPLL may be difficult to identify on MRI and is best seen on CT.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
Overview of rheumatoid arthritis 
• 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder where the synovium is the target of a waxing and waning immune response. Rheumatoid factor (RF) is typically positive, although it is not specific. RF is an antibody directed against IgG, which activates the complement cascade. RA clinically presents with symmetrical joint pain, swelling, and morning stiffness. 

• 
RA first affects the small joints in the hands and wrists. Foot involvement may occur early, so foot radiographs are routinely obtained in suspected cases of RA. In more advanced cases, RA affects the cervical spine, knees, shoulders, and hips. 

• 
Erosions are the imaging and pathologic hallmarks of RA, representing focal destruction of bone due to cumulative inflammatory damage. Erosions have been postulated to occur both due to the osteolytic interaction of synovial inflammation with articular cartilage (the “outside-in” theory) and destructive effect of inflammation within the bone (the “inside­out” theory). Half of RA patients develop erosions after one year of symptoms, and the development of erosions is associated with increased disability and decreased quality of life. 

• 
The imaging findings of RA include: 


Radiograph and CT findings  MRI findings  
Marginal erosions, which first occur at the intracapsular articular margins in the “bare area.” The bare area is a region of exposed bone just within the joint capsule that is not covered by thick cartilage. Soft-tissue swelling. Diffuse, symmetric joint space narrowing. Periarticular osteopenia. Joint subluxations.  Marginal erosions, which are fluid signal intensity and enhance. Synovitis, with thickened and early enhancing synovium. Subchondral edema, due to inflammatory and reactive changes. Joint subluxations.  


Rheumatoid arthritis in the hand and wrist 
• 
The hands are commonly affected in patients with RA. 

• 
Typical joints involved are the MCPs, PIPs, and the carpal articulations. The DIPs are usually spared. 

• 
The earliest radiographic changes of RA are soft-tissue swelling and periarticular osteopenia, reflecting synovitis and hyperemia. 

• 
Erosions occur early in disease, typically of the radial aspects of the second and third metacarpal heads, the radial and ulnar aspects of the bases of the proximal phalanges, and the ulnar styloid. 

• 
Joint subluxations are present in more advanced disease, which typically are not reducible and lead to several common deformities, including: 


Boutonnière deformity (PIP flexion and DIP hyperextension). Swan neck deformity (PIP hyperextension and DIP flexion). Ulnar subluxation of the fingers at the MCPs. 

Rheumatoid arthritis in the hands (continued) 




• Late-stage RA may uncommonly cause ankylosis (fibrosseous joint fusion occurring after complete cartilage loss) of the wrist. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (discussed later), in contrast, has a higher propensity for carpal ankylosis. 
Frontal radiograph of the wrist in a patient with severe longstanding RA shows severe periarticular osteopenia and pan-carpal ankylosis with osseous fusion across the radiocarpal, intercarpal, and second and third carpometacarpal joints. 


Rheumatoid arthritis in the feet 
• The feet are commonly involved in RA. Typically, the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints in the forefoot and the talocalcaneonavicular joint in the midfoot are involved. Up to 20% of patients have the MTP joint as the first site of involvement. 
Rheumatoid arthritis in the hip 
• 
Rheumatoid arthritis causes concentric acetabular cartilage loss which leads to axial migration of the femoral head. In contrast, osteoarthritis more commonly causes superior acetabular cartilage space narrowing and superolateral femoral head migration. 

• 
In severe cases, RA may cause a protrusio deformity, which is defined as >3 mm medial deviation of the femoral head beyond the ilioischial line in males and >6 mm in females. 



Rheumatoid arthritis with severe hip protrusio: Frontal radiograph of the pelvis shows bilateral severe axial cartilage space narrowing, with prominent acetabular protrusio deformities (arrows). 

Rheumatoid arthritis in the knee 
• 
All three joint spaces (medial and lateral tibiofemoral and patellofemoral) may be affected by RA in the knee. In contrast, OA tends to first affect the medial tibiofemoral articulation. If osteophytes and symmetrical cartilage space narrowing are present, then secondary osteoarthritis should be considered. 

• 
Unlike the smaller joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis, erosions are not a prominent 


manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis of the knee. 

Rheumatoid arthritis with secondary osteoarthritis: 
Frontal PA weight-bearing view of the knees shows cartilage space narrowing of medial and lateral tibiofemoral articulations bilaterally. The lateral tibiofemoral cartilage spaces are more markedly narrowed (yellow arrows). Prominent osteophytes laterally (red arrows) signify secondary osteoarthritis. 

Rheumatoid arthritis in the spine 
• 
The cervical spine is involved in up to 70% of patients. Involvement is increased with more severe and long-standing disease. 

• 
The general pattern of rheumatoid arthritis in the cervical spine includes subluxation at multiple levels, osteopenia, and erosions of the odontoid, facet joints, vertebral endplates, and spinous processes. Unlike osteoarthritis, there is no bone production. 

• 
A characteristic finding of rheumatoid arthritis is atlantoaxial (C1–C2) subluxation. Atlantoaxial subluxation may occur in multiple directions, including anterior (most common), posterior, vertical (atlantoaxial impaction), rotatory, and lateral. 

• 
Anterior atlantoaxial subluxation is caused by inflammation and resultant laxity of the transverse ligament, which normally functions to stabilize the atlantoaxial joint. 



Illustration and T2-weighted axial MRI demonstrating the transverse ligament, which stabilizes the atlantoaxial (C1–C2) articulation between the dens (C2) and C1. 
Anterior atlantoaxial subluxation may not be apparent if flexion radiographs are not obtained. Anterior atlantoaxial subluxation is present if the atlanto-dental interval (ADI) is >2.5 mm (>5 mm in children). The atlanto-dental interval is the distance between the anterior aspect of the dens and the posterior aspect of the anterior ring of C1. 


• Vertical atlantoaxial subluxation (also called atlantoaxial impaction) results from C1–C2 facet erosion and collapse, leading to protrusion of the odontoid through the foramen magnum. This may compress the midbrain. 
Direct visualization of the odontoid is usually not possible on a lateral radiograph, but impaction may cause the anterior arch of C1 (normally in-line with the odontoid) to sink to the level of the body of C2. 
• In the setting of RA, posterior atlantoaxial subluxation is usually due to odontoid erosion. It may also be caused by odontoid fracture. 


Seronegative spondyloarthropathies 
Overview of seronegative spondyloarthropathies 
• 
The seronegative spondyloarthropathies are a group of 4 inflammatory arthropathies, which by definition have negative rheumatoid factor. Patients are usually HLA-B27 positive. 

• 
The 4 seronegative spondyloarthropathies are ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis (previously called Reiters arthropathy), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) associated arthropathy. 


Sacroiliitis is a hallmark of the spondyloarthropathies 
• 
Similar to involvement in OA, only the inferior aspect of the sacroiliac (SI) joint is affected in seronegative spondyloarthropathies because only the inferior portion is a synovial (diarthrodial) joint. Erosions first involve the iliac aspect of the SI joint. 

• 
Symmetric sacroiliitis is caused by IBD and ankylosing spondylitis (mnemonic: both start with vowels). 



Symmetric sacroiliitis: CT Axial CT through the pelvis at the 
level of the sacroiliac joints shows 
symmetric sclerosis (arrows) at the 
iliac aspect of the sacroiliac joints 
bilaterally. 
Symmetric sacroiliitis: MRI 
Coronal-oblique STIR MRI through the sacroiliac joints demonstrates edema across the sacroiliac joints, predominantly involving the sacrum (yellow arrows). 
• 
Asymmetric sacroiliitis is caused by psoriatic arthritis and reactive arthropathy (mnemonic: both start with consonants). 

• 
An important cause of unilateral sacroiliitis is septic arthritis, especially in an immunocompromised patient or with intravenous drug abuse. Associated abscess may be present, which may be located at the anterior aspect of the sacroiliac joint. 


Ankylosing spondylitis 

Three patients with ankylosing spondylitis: 
Romanus and shiny corner lesions: Lateral radiograph of the upper lumbar spine (left image) shows an erosion of the anterior superior margin of a vertebral body at the discovertebral junction, representing a Romanus lesion (yellow arrow). The superiorly adjacent vertebral body demonstrates sclerosis of its anterior inferior margin, representing the shiny corner sign (red arrow). The shiny corner sign signifies evolution of a prior Romanus lesion. 
Bamboo spine: Frontal radiograph of the sacroiliac joints and lumbar spine (middle image) demonstrates symmetrical sacroiliac joint ankylosis (yellow arrows). There are diffuse syndesmophytes, creating an undulating contour of the spinal column, representing the bamboo spine (red arrows). There is fusion of the spinous processes, creating the dagger sign (blue arrow). 
Cervical fusion: Lateral radiograph of the cervical spine (right image) shows complete ankylosis of cervical spine with fusion of the vertebral bodies and facet joints and a pseudarthrosis at C2–C3 (green arrow).

• 
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is predominantly seen in young men with HLA-B27 and presents with back pain and stiffness. AS can be associated with pulmonary fibrosis (upper lobe predominant), aortitis, and cardiac conduction defects. 

• 
The earliest radiographic signs of AS are symmetric erosions, widening, and sclerosis of the sacroiliac joints. 

• 
Subsequently, the spine invariably becomes involved, with radiographic findings following a specific sequence, which ascend from the lumbar to the cervical spine. Romanus lesions are erosions of the anterior superior or inferior edges of the vertebral body endplates 


caused by enthesitis (inflammation at a ligament or tendon insertion site) at attachment of the annulus fibrosus to the vertebral body. Shiny corners represent sclerosis of prior Romanus lesions at the corners of the vertebral bodies. Squaring of the vertebral body disc margins develops due to erosions and bone loss. Delicate syndesmophytes represent bony bridging connecting adjacent vertebral margins, which create 
the classic bamboo spine (spinal ankylosis) in late-stage disease. 
• 
In advanced disease, the fully ankylosed spine is at a very high risk of fracture with even minor trauma. CT is necessary for evaluation of even minimal trauma in a patient with advanced AS and pain after trauma.

Psoriatic arthritis 

Psoriatic arthritis (arthritis mutilans form): 
PA radiograph of the hand demonstrates swelling of the third digit (yellow arrows). There are pencil-in­cup erosions of the DIP and PIP joints (red arrows). Multiple joint subluxations produce telescoping of the digits with a main-en-lorgnette (opera-glass hand) deformity. 
Case courtesy Barbara Weissman, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Psoriatic arthritis clinically presents as arthropathy in a patient with skin psoriasis. Psoriatic arthritis most commonly affects the hands. In contrast to RA, mineralization is preserved. Sacroiliitis, when present, is usually asymmetric. 

• 
There are several patterns of psoriatic arthritis, including oligoarthritis, polyarthritis, spondyloarthropathy (producing bulky asymmetric bridging), and arthritis mutilans (a severe form usually affecting the hands, less commonly the feet). 

• 
In the hands, the radiographic hallmark of psoriatic arthritis is diffuse soft-tissue swelling of an entire digit, producing the sausage digit. Pencil-in-cup erosions are also characteristic, most commonly affecting the DIPs. Although hand findings are usually bilateral, involvement tends to be asymmetric. The severe arthritis mutilans variant can cause marked deformity and telescoping digits, also known as the main-en-lorgnette (opera-glass hand) deformity. 


Additional findings in the hands include fluffy periostitis and ill-defined erosions of the joint margins. 
• 
In the foot, the great toe interphalangeal and MTP joints are most commonly affected. An ivory phalanx represents osteosclerosis and is relatively specific for psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis produces a plantar calcaneal spur with periosteal reaction. In contrast, a degenerative calcaneal spur will not feature reactive new bone. 

• 
In the spine, psoriatic arthritis causes formation of coarse bony bridging (bulky lateral bony outgrowths), sometimes indistinguishable from reactive arthropathy (discussed below). 


Reactive arthropathy (previously called Reiter disease) 
• 
Reactive arthropathy is an inflammatory arthritis thought to be a sequela of infectious diarrhea, urethritis, or cervicitis. Sacroiliitis is usually asymmetric, as in psoriatic arthritis. 

• 
Reactive arthropathy predominantly affects the feet, where it has a similar appearance to psoriatic arthritis. Initial radiographic findings include diffuse soft-tissue swelling, joint space loss, aggressive marginal erosions, and juxta-articular osteopenia. Bony mineralization is preserved in the later stage of disease. 

• 
In particular, the calcaneus is a common site of involvement with bony proliferative changes including erosions, enthesophytes, and fluffy periosteal reaction. The posterior-superior aspect of the calcaneus is a frequent site of erosion due to adjacent bursitis. There is often secondary Achilles tendinitis and thickening of the soft-tissues. 

• 
In the hands, reactive arthropathy affects the interphalangeal joints and MTPs with erosions and diaphyseal periostitis. 

• 
Reactive arthropathy may affect the spine with formation of coarse bony bridging, which may be difficult to distinguish from psoriatic arthritis. 




Connective tissue disorders affecting the joints 
Systemic lupus erythematosus 

Lupus arthropathy: Oblique radiographs of both hands demonstrate multiple subluxations of both hands, without erosive change. Note the swan neck deformities of both small fingers, with hyperextension of the PIPs (arrows) and flexion of the DIPs. Swan neck deformities are the most common joint deformity in patients with lupus arthropathy. 
• 
Joint abnormalities are seen in ~90% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). 

• 
The key radiographic finding of SLE is reducible subluxations of the MCPs and PIPs, with absence of erosive change. 

• 
In early disease, alignment may appear normal on a PA view when the hands are compressed against the radiographic plate. Subluxations become apparent in the Norgaard (“ballcatcher’s” or “you’re in good hands with Allstate”) or oblique views when the hand is not constrained. 

• 
Over time, the subluxations may become permanent, which can result in chronic bony remodeling. These remodeling changes should not be confused with erosions. 



Frontal radiograph of the right hand taken 10 years later in the same patient as above demonstrates marked progression of subluxations with bony remodeling. The remodeling changes are most pronounced at the fourth and fifth PIPs. 
Jaccoud arthropathy 
• Jaccoud arthropathy was historically described as being secondary to recurrent rheumatic fever, but some authors feel that SLE and Jaccoud arthropathy are the same disease. Both entities share the same type III hypersensitivity mechanism and feature identical radiographic findings of reducible subluxations in the hand. 

Scleroderma 
• 
Scleroderma is a systemic collagen vascular disease caused by collagen deposition in the skin and soft-tissues. The fingertips are affected first, with atrophy of the distal soft-tissues. 

• 
Acro-osteolysis (resorption of the distal portion of the distal phalanges) is characteristic, especially if there is accompanying calcification. 



Acro-osteolysis and soft tissue calcification in a patient with scleroderma. Frontal radiograph of the hand (with the fingertips magnified) shows acro-osteolysis of the distal tuft (yellow arrow) and soft tissue mineralizations in the fingertips (red arrows). 
• Acro-osteolysis is not specific to scleroderma. The differential for acro-osteolysis includes: 
Collagen vascular disease, including scleroderma and Raynaud’s. Neuropathy. Polyvinyl chloride exposure. Thermal injury (burn or frostbite). In frostbite the thumb is usually spared because it is clenched in a fist. Hyperparathyroidism, seen in conjunction with subperiosteal reabsorption. Hajdu-Cheney, a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by short stature, craniofacial 
changes, and progressive acro-osteolysis. Psoriasis. Pyknodysostosis. 
• Dystrophic soft-tissue and periarticular calcifications are common in scleroderma, which causes tightening and fibrosis of the skin and often leads to joint contractures. 

Frontal radiograph of the forearm in a patient with scleroderma shows extensive soft tissue mineralizations along the ulnar aspect of the forearm and at the base of the thumb metacarpals (arrows). 

Polymyositis and dermatomyositis 
• 
Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are idiopathic conditions characterized by inflammation of muscle (polymyositis) or muscle and skin (dermatomyositis). Joint abnormalities are rare, although periarticular osteopenia may be present in these conditions. 

• 
The imaging hallmark of polymyositis and dermatomyositis is soft-tissue calcification. Intramuscular calcifications are most common, although subcutaneous calcifications may also be seen, similar to scleroderma. 




Crystal arthropathies 
Overview of crystal arthropathies 
• 
Crystalline arthropathies are a common form of arthritis caused by intra-articular inflammation induced by the deposition of various crystals. 

• 
By far the two most common crystal arthropathies are calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis and gout (caused by monosodium urate). While calcium hydroxyapatite usually causes calcific tendinopathy, it much less commonly causes intra-articular inflammation. 

• 
Clinically, crystal arthropathies may mimic inflammatory arthropathy, septic arthritis, or osteoarthritis. 

• 
Imaging plays a key role in diagnosis of crystal arthropathies, although arthrocentesis with crystal analysis is the gold standard in ambiguous cases. 


Calcium pyrophosphate manifests on imaging as chondrocalcinosis, which is deposition of calcium salts on hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage. Gout has characteristic periarticular erosions with overhanging edges, and gouty tophi may manifest as 
high attenuation soft tissue nodules or masses. 
Hydroxyapatite appears as globular or amorphous mineralization (usually within a tendon) without internal trabeculation. Dual-energy CT can identify monosodium urate or calcium pyrophosphate. 
Calcium pyrophosphate 
• 
The most common crystalline arthropathy is the arthritis caused by calcium pyrophosphate (CPP). Microscopically, the rhomboid crystals of CPPD are positively birefringent. Crystal deposition may be idiopathic (by far the most common) or associated with hemochromatosis, hyperparathyroidism, and hypophosphatasia. 

• 
Acute CPP arthritis describes the acute inflammatory phase of this condition, with a clinical presentation that may mimic septic arthritis with acute pain, swelling, erythema, and elevated inflammatory markers. Chronic CPP arthritis has been called the “great mimicker” of other arthropathies, including osteoarthritis (most common), gout, and rheumatoid. 

• 
The hallmark radiographic finding of CPP arthritis is chondrocalcinosis, which is calcification of hyaline (articular) or fibro (meniscal/labral) cartilage. Radiographs of the knees, wrist, and pelvis (pubic symphysis) are nearly 100% sensitive for the detection of chondrocalcinosis. Importantly, chondrocalcinosis is a very common finding of unknown incidence seen in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Additionally, positive crystal analysis has been reported in patients without radiographic chondrocalcinosis, especially in the early stages. Therefore, the absence of chondrocalcinosis cannot exclude CPP arthritis, and the presence of chondrocalcinosis does not imply that the patient’s pain is due to CPP arthritis. 

• 
On radiography and CT, chondrocalcinosis of the articular cartilage appears as thin, linear calcifications of the articular cartilage, paralleling the subchondral bone plate. Chondrocalcinosis of the fibrocartilage (e.g., menisci and labral) follows the course of the fibrocartilage, with a thick and irregular or shaggy border. Calcium pyrophosphate may also line ligaments and synovium, where it appears as an indistinct, cloud-like mineralization. 

• 
In the wrist, chondrocalcinosis tends to affect the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). Advanced disease may lead to scapholunate advanced collapse (SLAC) wrist due to destruction of the scapholunate ligament due to CPP-induced inflammation. SLAC wrist is proximal migration of the capitate between the dissociated scaphoid and lunate, and may also be seen in RA or trauma.

Chondrocalcinosis: Frontal radiograph of the wrist demonstrates chondrocalcinosis of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC, yellow arrow) and at the index MCP (red arrow). 
the TFCC and scattered mineralizations about the wrist. 
• In the knee, the patellofemoral compartment is affected first, but all three compartments may become involved. Isolated degenerative changes of the patellofemoral joint may be due to CPP arthritis (usually in an older person, especially if there are subchondral cysts and chondrocalcinosis) or patellar maltracking. 

CPP arthritis of the knee. Frontal (left image) radiograph of the knee shows prominent chondrocalcinosis of the menisci and articular cartilage (arrows) with small medial tibiofemoral osteophytes. There is severe patellofemoral osteoarthritis with bone-on-bone articulation laterally. In this patient, subchondral cysts were not demonstrated. 
• In the hands, involvement of the second and third MCP joints is typical, producing characteristic hook-like osteophytes from the radial aspect of the metacarpal heads. A similar appearance can be seen in hemochromatosis, which may feature more extensive involvement of the MCPs, although there is a large crossover in imaging. 

Frontal radiograph of the hand in the same patient with knees imaged above demonstrates osteophytes of the MCPs with severe cartilage space loss at the index finger (arrow). There is prominent chondrocalcinosis of all MCPs. 

Gout 
• Gout is a crystal-induced inflammatory arthropathy caused by sodium urate deposition in the joints. Excess uric acid may be secondary to under-excretion (more common, typically caused by renal insufficiency) or overproduction (much more rare, typically seen in younger patients). 
It takes about 10–20 years of hyperuricemia 
before the clinical syndrome of gout develops. Microscopically, gout crystals are negatively birefringent needle-like crystals within neutrophils. 
• 
The great toe is most commonly involved, but gout can occur in any joint. 

• 
Radiographic hallmarks are sharply marginated erosions with overhanging margins. 

• 
Joint spaces are typically well preserved until late in the disease. Similarly, bony mineralization is preserved until the late phases. 

• 
Ultrasound of gout shows a double contour sign representing an irregular hyperechoic line of urate crystals deposited on the hyperechoic cartilage. 

• 
MRI is not a primary modality for evaluation of gout, but erosions and variable signal intensity intra-articular and periarticular gouty tophi are well seen. 

• 
Tophaceous gout refers to deposition of urate crystals, inflammatory cells, and foreign body giant cells in the soft tissues. Gouty tophi may occur anywhere in the body, including within the joint and periarticular locations such as tendons, ligaments, and bursae. In particular, gouty tophi have a propensity to develop in the olecranon bursa of the elbow. 

• 
Dual-energy CT is an excellent modality to identify monosodium urate crystals, which are typically colored green in post-processing. By altering the post-processing parameters, green color coding can also be used to identify CPP crystals.

Gouty arthropathy of the ankle: Coronal CT shows erosions of the medial talus and medial malleolus (yellow arrows) and amorphous mineralization (red arrow) in the deltoid ligament. Color-coded post-processed dual-energy CT shows that the deltoid mineralization is colored green (red arrows) on the gout algorithm, consistent with monosodium urate deposition. There was no green color-coding on the CPP algorithm (not shown). 

Calcium hydroxyapatite 
• 
Also called calcific tendinitis or calcific tendinopathy, calcium hydroxyapatite deposition results from crystals being deposited in degenerating or hypoxic tendons, triggering an inflammatory cascade. 

• 
Calcific tendinopathy is not associated with hypercalcemia, but it is seen more commonly in diabetic patients. 

• 
On radiographs and CT, the mineralization of calcium hydroxyapatite appears amorphous or globular. Importantly, there cannot be any cortication or internal trabeculation, either of which would suggest bone formation by osteoblasts due to a different etiology from calcific tendinopathy. If cortication or trabeculation were present then the differential diagnosis could include intra-articular body, fragmented enthesophyte, or osteochondromatosis. 

• 
Calcific tendinopathy may erode through tendons and cause adjacent calcific bursitis. Rarely, calcific tendinopathy may erode into bone (most commonly at the insertion of pectoralis major at the anterior aspect of the proximal humerus) and simulate neoplasm with the differential including parosteal sarcoma or myositis ossificans. 

• 
On ultrasound, calcium hydroxyapatite appears as globular hyperechoic shadowing foci. 

• 
On MR, the calcium hydroxyapatite deposits are low signal intensity on all pulse sequences, often with surrounding edema/inflammatory change. 

• 
Ultrasound-guided barbotage is an effective treatment for calcific tendinopathy. In this procedure, a larger-bore needle (18–20 gauge) is directed into the calcific deposit and gently pulsed with a dilute anesthetic/saline solution to break up the deposit. Often, chalky deposits are expelled retrograde into the body of the syringe with negative pressure on the plunger. 

• 
The shoulder is by far the most common site in the body for calcific tendinopathy, with the  supraspinatus tendon the most commonly affected. 



Grashey radiograph Coronal T2-weighted MRI with fat supp. 
Calcific tendinopathy of supraspinatus: Radiograph shows lobulated mineralization (arrow) just cranial to the footprint of the greater tuberosity. Note the required absence of internal trabeculation and peripheral cortication. MRI demonstrates that the globular low-signal mineralization (yellow arrow) has eroded through the supraspinatus tendon and extends into the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa, where there is a moderate-sized bursal effusion (red arrow). 

Calcium hydroxyapatite (continued) 
• The tendons about the hip, including the gluteal and rectus tendons, are likely more commonly involved by calcific tendinopathy than clinically acknowledged. 

Frontal radiograph Axial proton-density weighted MRI with fat supp. 

Ultrasound Post-procedure syringe 
Calcific tendinopathy of gluteus medius: Radiograph shows globular and featureless mineralization (arrow) just cranial to the greater trochanter. MRI shows the posterior position of the mineralization, located at the gluteus medius myotendinous junction as globular low signal (arrow). Intraprocedural ultrasound demonstrates the needle tip (red arrow) abutting the lobulated hyperechoic shadowing (arrows) of the calcific deposit. Magnified photograph from the syringe after barbotage shows the chalk-like calcifications obtained after pulsed lavage. 
• In the wrist, the most common site is the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) tendon. 
The FCU tendon originates from the common flexor mass at the humeral medial epicondyle and attaches to the pisiform before continuing to the hamate and fifth metacarpal. 

FCU calcific tendinopathy: Frontal (left image) and lateral radiographs of the wrist demonstrate amorphous mineralization (arrow) just proximal to the pisiform. A common pitfall of mineralization at the ulnar aspect of the wrist is to presume that it is chondrocalcinosis of the TFC; however this mineralization is more distal and ulnar in location. Lateral radiograph confirms that the mineralization (arrow) is located volar, along the expected course of FCU. 

Calcium hydroxyapatite (continued) 
• Calcific tendinopathy of the longus colli muscle may cause neck pain, odynophagia, fever, and prevertebral effusion, and may clinically mimic a prevertebral abscess. 

Axial CT with contrast (bone window). Sagittal CT with contrast (soft tissue window). 
Calcific tendinopathy of longus colli: Axial CT shows globular and featureless mineralizations (arrow) anterior to and to the left of the dens, within the left longus colli muscle. Sagittal CT just to the right of midline shows a prevertebral fluid collection (red arrows). Please note that the sagittal image on the right demonstrates how calcific tendinopathy of longus colli can mimic a prevertebral abscess even on CT if the calcifications are not seen. 
• The vast majority of calcium hydroxyapatite is extra-articular. A very rare intra-articular variant seen in the shoulder, called Milwaukee shoulder, leads to rapid destruction of the rotator cuff and the glenohumeral joint. 
Milwaukee shoulder is a destructive arthritis characterized by extensive full-thickness rotator cuff tears, marked cartilage and bone destruction, and large bloody effusions. Similar to neuropathic arthropathy, the bone destruction can have sharp margins with an atrophic appearance. 

Frontal radiograph Coronal STIR 
Milwaukee shoulder (not pathologically confirmed): Frontal radiograph demonstrates destruction of the medial humeral head and indistinct intra-articular mineralization in the axillary recess (yellow arrow). Coronal STIR MRI shows sharply marginated destruction of the medial humeral head (red arrow). There is extensive rotator cuff tearing, with globular morphology of the medially retracted torn cuff tendons (blue arrow). There is a low signal intensity effusion with distension of the axillary recess corresponding to the mineralization (yellow arrow). 
A cervical spine MRI (not shown) was negative for syrinx or other explanation for potential neuropathic arthropathy. Aspiration was performed with a large amount of bloody fluid aspirated (not shown). In this case, intra-articular hydroxyapatite crystals were not demonstrated on pathologic analysis, but the imaging features remain consistent with Milwaukee shoulder. 


Metabolic, hematologic, and miscellaneous arthropathies 
Hemochromatosis 
• Hemochromatosis arthropathy affects 50% of those with hemochromatosis, an autosomal recessive disease of altered iron metabolism. The arthropathy is caused by deposition of iron and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals. 
Hemochromatosis clinically presents with bronze pigmentation, diabetes, cirrhosis, CHF, and arthropathy. 
• In the hand, the typical location of hemochromatosis arthropathy is the MCP joints, producing characteristic hook-like osteophytes at the metacarpal heads. Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease (CPPD) can appear identical when involvement is isolated to the second and third MCPs. In contrast to CPPD, hemochromatosis may involve all MCPs. 

Acromegaly 


Frontal hand radiograph shows “spade­like enlargement” of the tufts of the distal phalanges (yellow arrows). 
• 
Acromegaly (excess growth hormone) causes arthropathy due to enlargement of the articular cartilage and subsequent degeneration. In contrast to all other arthropathies, joint spaces are widened in early disease due to cartilage hypertrophy. Later in disease, secondary osteoarthritis occurs with cartilage space narrowing. 

• 
In the hand, beak-like osteophytes of the metacarpal heads and spade-like enlargement of the terminal tufts are characteristic. 



Amyloid arthropathy 
• 
Amyloid arthropathy is a rare noninflammatory arthropathy due to infiltration of bones, joints and soft-tissues by beta-pleated sheets of amino acids. Primary systemic amyloidosis is associated with monoclonal plasma cell dyscrasia. Secondary amyloidosis is associated with chronic underlying inflammation or infection. Another form of amyloidosis is caused by ß2-microglobulin accumulation in patients on chronic hemodialysis. 

• 
A characteristic clinical finding of amyloidosis is bulky soft-tissue nodules in the shoulder superimposed upon atrophic shoulder muscles, producing the shoulder-pad sign. 

• 
Imaging findings of amyloid arthropathy are nonspecific but may resemble RA. Intra-articular deposits cause articular cartilage destruction. Soft-tissue nodules and erosions may be present. 


Ochronosis (alkaptonuria) 

Lateral radiograph of the thoracic spine demonstrates calcification of the intervertebral disc at each level (arrows), with mild diffuse disc height loss. 
• 
Ochronosis is the connective tissue manifestation of alkaptonuria. Alkaptonuria is caused by a defect in homogentisic acid oxidase, causing homogentisic acid polymers to accumulate in the visceral organs, intervertebral discs, and joints. Clinically, homogentisic acid in the urine turns black when exposed to air. 

• 
A specific finding of ochronosis is intervertebral disc calcifications at every level with accompanying disc space narrowing. 



Sarcoidosis 
• 
Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatous disease. Lung findings, including adenopathy and parenchymal disease, are present in the majority of patients and are the primary manifestation of disease. 

• 
Bony manifestations of sarcoid are rare. A characteristic finding in the hands is lace-like lytic lesions in the middle or distal phalanges. 

• 
Sarcoidosis may also manifest as acute or chronic polyarthritis, although there are no distinctive radiographic patterns. Ankle involvement, especially if bilateral or associated with erythema nodosum, should raise suspicion of sarcoidosis and prompt a chest radiograph. 



Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis 
• 
Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis is a rare disease where lipid-laden macrophages are deposited in soft-tissues and periarticular tendons, forming skin nodules and erosions with sclerotic margins. 

• 
The well-defined erosions of multicentric reticulohistiocytosis tend to affect the DIPs symmetrically. Other radiographic findings of multicentric reticulohistiocytosis include soft-tissue nodules and preserved bone density. 

• 
Joint destruction may be rapid and progressive, producing an arthritis mutilans appearance. 



Hemophilic arthropathy 

Hemophilic arthropathy: Lateral elbow radiograph shows severe joint space narrowing. Increased soft-tissue density surrounding the joint (arrow) is due to synovial hemosiderin deposition. 
In this case, the size of the radial head is not enlarged, but classically hemophilia features an enlarged radial head. 
• 
Hemophilia is an X-linked inherited disorder of either factor VIII (hemophilia A) or IX (hemophilia B; Christmas disease) deficiency causing recurrent bleeding. 

• 
Hemophilia most often affects the knees, elbows, and ankles. Recurrent hemarthrosis results in synovial hypertrophy and hyperemia. The hyperemia may cause epiphyseal enlargement and early fusion. 


Characteristic appearance of the elbow is an enlarged radial head and widened trochlear notch. Characteristic appearance of the knee is squaring of the patella and widened intercondylar notch. 
• 
Secondary arthritis may lead to marked joint space narrowing. 

• 
Deposition of iron in the synovium causes increased soft-tissue density around joints. 

• 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (discussed below) also causes articular hyperemia and may have similar radiographic findings, especially in the knee (widened intercondylar notch) and elbow (enlarged radial head). 

• 
Pseudotumor of hemophilia is a benign lesion caused by recurrent intraosseous or subperiosteal bleeding. The chronic cyclical bleeding leads to bony scalloping and pressure erosion, often with an associated soft-tissue mass. 


On radiography, pseudotumor is benign-appearing, with well-circumscribed and sclerotic margins. Pseudotumor may have a complex MRI appearance due to different stages of blood products. 

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), previously called juvenile rheumatoid arthritis 
• 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a spectrum of related chronic inflammatory arthropathies affecting children younger than 16 years of age. 

• 
Monoarticular or pauciarticular (most common) JIA may affect either a single joint or a few joints including the knees, ankles, elbows, or wrists. 

• 
Polyarticular JIA is a systemic disease affecting multiple joints including the hands, feet, and cervical spine in addition to the joints affected by mono/pauciarticular disease. 

• 
A variant of JIA is Still disease, which is a systemic disorder affecting children younger than 5, featuring acute febrile illness, rash, adenopathy, pericarditis, and mild arthralgias. 

• 
Radiographic hallmarks of JIA are abnormal bone length or morphology due to hyperemia in a skeletally immature patient. Growth disturbances are more commonly seen in early-onset disease. Abnormal morphology results from epiphyseal overgrowth and enlargement (ballooning) of the ends of bone. Affected joints demonstrate premature skeletal maturation and physeal fusion. 

• 
In the hand, premature fusion of the growth plate may cause brachydactyly (short fingers). 



PA radiograph of the hand in a patient with juvenile idiopathic arthritis shows a shortened fifth metacarpal (arrow). 
• 
In the knee, the characteristic appearance is a widened intercondylar notch, metaphyseal flaring, and uniform joint space narrowing. This appearance can appear similar to hemophilia. 

• 
In the elbow, there is characteristic enlargement of the radial head and trochlear notch, with uniform cartilage space narrowing. These findings can also be seen in hemophilia. 

• 
In the hips, symmetrical cartilage space narrowing, protrusio deformity, and gracile appearance of the femoral shaft are characteristic. 

• 
Ankylosis may occur in the wrist and zygapophyseal (facet) joints of the cervical spine. Ankylosis occurs much more commonly in juvenile idiopathic arthropathy compared to adult rheumatoid arthritis. The differential diagnosis of a child with cervical spine ankylosis is Klippel-Feil syndrome, which is failure of cervical segmentation. 



Neuropathic arthropathy (Charcot joint) 
• 
Neuropathic arthropathy, also called Charcot joint, is a destructive form of arthritis caused by neurosensory deficit. Lack of sensation ultimately causes severe degenerative changes with fragmentation of bone and cartilage. 

• 
Neuropathic arthropathy clinically presents as a (usually) painless, swollen joint. 

• 
Neuropathic arthropathy can be caused by any process that affects sensory nerves. The peripheral neuropathy of diabetes is implicated most frequently, typically affecting joints in the ankle and foot. Other causes include syringomyelia (usually affecting the upper extremity), chronic alcohol abuse, amyloid, spinal tumors, and very rarely syphilis or leprosy. 

• 
Two forms of neuropathic arthropathy are hypertrophic (more common) and atrophic variants. 

• 
The hypertrophic variant looks like anarchy in a joint, with destruction, dislocation (or subluxation), debris, disorganization, and no demineralization. 



Neuropathic 
arthropathy: 
Lateral radiograph of the foot demonstrates subluxation of the Lisfranc joint (yellow arrow). Hypertrophic degenerative changes 
are present at the tarsometatarsal joint 
There was no history of trauma. 
• The atrophic variant of neuropathic arthropathy occurs most commonly in the shoulder. It features a classic radiographic appearance of humeral head resorption with a sharp, surgical-like margin. Syringomyelia should be suspected in upper extremity neuropathic arthropathy and confirmed by cervical spine MRI.
