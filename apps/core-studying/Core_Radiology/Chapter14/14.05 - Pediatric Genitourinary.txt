Pediatric Genitourinary 
Hydronephrosis and Hydroureter 
Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) 
• 
Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is abnormal retrograde reflux of urine from the bladder into the ureter, which predisposes to acute pyelonephritis, renal scarring, and irreversible loss of renal function. VUR can be primary (due to an abnormally short intravesicular portion of the distal ureter) or secondary (due to distal obstruction, such as from posterior urethral valves or neurogenic bladder). 

• 
The typical imaging evaluation of a child with a febrile UTI is controversial and may involve renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). Noncontrast ultrasound is not sensitive for the detection of reflux, although the presence of urothelial thickening is suggestive of reflux. Studies suggest that approximately 5% of children with a UTI and a normal ultrasound have VUR. 

• 
Siblings of patients diagnosed with reflux are typically screened with ultrasound: the prevalence of siblings with asymptomatic VUR is 25–50%. 

• 
Fluoroscopic VCUG is often preferred as the initial study for evaluation of reflux because it provides anatomic details about the upper tract and also allows evaluation of the urethra.  Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is increasingly being used for the assessment of VUR, and the posterior urethra can be assessed via transperineal views.  


In boys, partial posterior urethral valves may be a cause of UTI. 
• Grading of reflux is based on VCUG: 
I: Reflux into ureter only, with normal ureteral and calyceal morphology. 
II: Reflux into non-dilated renal calyces, with normal ureteral and calyceal morphology. 
III: Reflux into renal collecting system, with blunting of the calyces (loss of normal “spiky” appearance of calyces). 
IV: Reflux into moderately dilated ureter. 
V: Reflux into severely dilated and tortuous ureter. 

Bilateral grade IV reflux: Fluoroscopic stored image from a VCUG shows moderate calyceal and ureteral dilation. 
• The goal of any treatment of VUR is to prevent pyelonephritis and the resultant renal scarring which can lead to irreversible loss of renal function. The treatment can be either medical (prophylactic antibiotics) or surgical, depending on the grade. 
Grades I–III are initially treated medically (prophylactic antibiotics). Higher grade reflux often is treated surgically. 
• Approximately 90% of grade I and II reflux will spontaneously regress after a few years. 

Vesicoureteral refl ux (VUR; continued) 
• Two nuclear studies are oft en used for the evaluati on and follow-up of refl ux: Radionuclide cystogram (RNC) involves the insti llati on of approximately 1 mCi of Tc-99m pertechnetate 
into the bladder through a catheter. RNC is the most sensiti ve test to evaluate for refl ux. RNC is oft en used for follow-up of refl ux once the anatomy is established by VCUG. RNC grading is three-stage: 
RNC grade 1: Ureteral refl ux only (VCUG I). RNC grade 2: Refl ux reaches renal calyces (VCUG II–III). RNC grade 3: Ureteral dilati on (VCUG IV–V). 
Tc-99m-DMSA renal scinti graphy (DMSA scan) is the gold standard for detecti on of renal corti cal scarring, seen as areas of relati ve photopenia. 
Duplex collecting system 
Two pati ents with duplicated collecti ng systems: Intravenous pyelogram (left  image) shows a duplicated right collecti ng system, with mild blunti ng of the upper pole calyces (yellow arrow). 
In a diff erent pati ent, coronal (top right image) and axial contrast-enhanced pyelographic phase CT shows severe hydronephrosis of the obstructed right upper pole (red arrow). The dilated, unopacifi ed upper pole ureter (blue arrow) courses medially to the opacifi ed, normal-caliber lower pole ureter (green arrow). 
• 
A duplex collecti ng system contains two separate pelvicalyceal systems and two ureters. A duplex system may be of no clinical signifi cance if the ureters fuse. However, if the ureters insert separately into the bladder, there is an increased risk of obstructi on (in the upper pole moiety) and refl ux (in the lower pole moiety), as described by the Weigert-Meyer rule. 

• 
The Weigert-Meyer rule: In a duplicated system, the upper pole ureter inserts ectopically (inferomedially) into the bladder and is prone to obstructi on, oft en due to a ureterocele. The lower pole ureter inserts orthotopically (normally) on the bladder but is prone to refl ux. 


obstructed superior moiety 
duplicated kidney 
inferior moiety inferiorly displaced by obstructed superior moiety 
normal kidney and collecting system lower pole ureter inserts orthotopically (normally), but is prone to re˜ux 
upper pole ureter inserts ectopically, inferior and medial to the lower pole ureter. 
ureterocele causing obstruction 

Duplex collecting system (continued) 
• Although hydronephrosis in an obstructed upper pole system would be apparent on ultrasound, a completely obstructed system may not be seen on VCUG at all since contrast cannot flow retrograde into the obstructed ureter. The drooping lily sign is seen on VCUG where the “invisible” obstructed upper moiety compresses the refluxed contrast in the lower moiety collecting system. 
The differential diagnosis of a drooping lily is renal ptosis, which would be expected to show a normal number of calyces. In contrast, the obstructed upper pole of the drooping lily has fewer calyces. 
Ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction 
• 
Ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction is the most common congenital anomaly of the genitourinary tract in neonates and the most common cause of unilateral hydronephrosis in children. UPJ obstruction may be caused by abnormal development of the upper segment of the ureter, an aberrant renal artery compressing the ureter, an aperistaltic segment of the ureter, or can be idiopathic. 

• 
Imaging shows hydronephrosis and dilated renal pelvis, with normal caliber distal ureter. 


Ureterovesical (UVJ) obstruction 
• 
Ureterovesical (UVJ) obstruction is more rare and can be a result of several etiologies, most commonly megaureter in a single-system kidney or a ureterocele in the setting of ectopic ureteral insertion. 

•A 
ureterocele is focal dilation of the distal ureter within the bladder wall, where the ureter infolds between the mucosal and muscular layers of the bladder wall. 

• 
An ectopic ureterocele is almost always associated with ectopic insertion of the upper pole ureter in a duplicated system. A simple ureterocele is seen with an orthotopically (normally) inserting ureter. 

• 
The typical ultrasound appearance of an ectopic ureterocele is a cystic lesion within the bladder wall, usually associated with hydroureter and hydronephrosis of an obstructed upper pole moiety in a duplex system. Ectopic ureteroceles are almost always located inferior and medial to the lower pole ureteral insertion site. 

• 
VCUG typically shows the ureterocele as a rounded filling defect. The cobra head sign can be seen on IVP or ultrasound. 


Posterior urethral valves (PUV) 
• 
Posterior urethral valve is the most common cause of congenital bladder outlet obstruction, occurring exclusively in boys. It is caused by an obstructing web in the posterior (prostatic) urethra at the base of the verumontanum. 

• 
Ultrasound shows dilation of the posterior (prostatic) urethra, a dilated and trabeculated bladder, and bilateral hydronephrosis. The appearance of the dilated posterior urethra and dilated bladder produces the characteristic keyhole appearance on ultrasound. 


Calyceal rupture may occur, resulting in perinephric fluid collections, urinomas and ascites. 
• The main differential consideration is prune belly syndrome, which would show dilation of the entire ureter rather than only the prostatic portion. 
Prune belly syndrome 
• 
Prune belly, or Eagle Barrett, syndrome is a congenital muscular disorder that affects the abdominal wall musculature and the smooth muscles of the entire urinary tract. 

• 
Prune belly may be associated with cryptorchidism, as bladder distension interferes with the descent of testes. 

• 
The muscular defect leads to dilation of the entire collecting system, including bladder and 


both ureters. In contrast to posterior urethral valves, the entire urethra is dilated. Peds: 1147 


Summary of levels of obstruction 
• This schematic diagram of the genitourinary system demonstrates the anatomic locations for various causes of hydronephrosis or hydroureter: 



Congenital renal malformations 
Renal agenesis 
• 
Renal agenesis can be unilateral or bilateral (incompatible with life); a common imaging clue is the lying down adrenal which helps differentiate congenitally from surgically absent kidney. 

• 
Renal agenesis is associated with reproductive anomalies (Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome) including unicornuate uterus, absent epididymis and vas deferens, and seminal vesicle cysts. 


Horseshoe kidney 
• 
Horseshoe kidney represents a fusion anomaly of the lower poles, preventing ascent of the kidneys at the level of the inferior mesenteric artery. 

• 
Complications such as injury against the adjacent vertebral body preclude patients from playing certain sports. Patients are also at increased risk for stones, infection and cancer including Wilms, TCC, and renal carcinoid. 

• 
There is a classic association with Turner’s syndrome. 


Cross-fused renal ectopia 
• 
In cross-fused renal ectopia, the ectopic kidney (more commonly the left) crosses midline to fuse with the inferior pole of the contralateral kidney, each retaining its own orthotopic ureteral orifice. 

• 
Complications include stones, infection and hydronephrosis. 




Cystic renal lesions 
Hydronephrosis 
• Hydronephrosis is the most common cystic abdominal mass in a neonate. 
Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) 

Multicystic dysplastic kidney: Two longitudinal ultrasound images of the kidney show multiple separate cystic structures that do not connect. The main differential consideration is hydronephrosis, in which case the cystic spaces would demonstrate continuity. 
• 
Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is the most common neonatal cystic renal mass, characterized by a progressive renal dysplasia thought to be a result of abnormal induction of the metanephric blastema by the ureteric bud, or due to atresia of the renal pelvis/ proximal ureter leading to urinary obstruction. 

• 
MCDK is typically unilateral, but bilateral abnormalities may be present in 20–30%. 

• 
The natural progression of MCDK is gradual involution into a small soft tissue remnant. It is thought that many adults with a solitary kidney may have had a previously undiagnosed, involuted MCDK. 

• 
The risk of Wilms tumor in MCDK is controversial. Although an association between MCDK and Wilms tumor has been reported, there is no strong evidence to support a link. 

• 
Imaging of MCDK shows a multicystic “mass” replacing the renal parenchyma. The cystic elements do not communicate with each other, which is in contrast to hydronephrosis. 


A DMSA scan shows no cortical uptake in MCDK, compared to faint radiotracer cortical uptake even in hydronephrosis. 
Multilocular cystic nephroma 
• 
Multilocular cystic nephroma is a benign, multiseptated cystic neoplasm. It has a bimodal age distribution, seen in young boys aged three months to two years and middle-aged women. 

• 
There is an association with DICER1 mutations and pleuropulmonary blastoma. 

• 
On imaging, multilocular cystic nephroma appears as a multiseptated cystic renal mass with enhancing septa. Its appearance may mimic cystic Wilms tumor. A characteristic imaging finding is the propensity to herniate into the renal pelvis, causing hydronephrosis. 



Simple renal cyst 
• An isolated simple renal cyst is rare in children. When seen, renal cysts are more likely to be syndromic, in association with tuberous sclerosis or von Hippel-Lindau. 
Tuberous sclerosis: In addition to renal cysts, patients may have: Renal angiomyolipomas. Cardiac rhabdomyoma. CNS cortical hamartomas, subependymal nodules, and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. 
von Hippel-Lindau (VHL): In addition to renal cysts, patients have: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC): Up to 30% of VHL patients die from RCC. Adrenal pheochromocytoma. Pancreatic cysts, islet cell tumors, and serous cystadenomas. Brain and spinal cord hemangioblastomas. 

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) 
• 
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) usually manifests in adulthood, although 50% develop some cysts within the first decade of life. 

• 
ADPKD typically features renal enlargement with numerous cysts of varying sizes. 

• 
ADPKD is associated with hepatic cysts and less commonly pancreatic cysts. 



Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) 
• 
Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) features tiny cysts that develop in infancy due to generalized dilation of the collecting tubules. The cysts are typically too small to be resolvable by imaging, producing a characteristic appearance on ultrasound of bilaterally enlarged and diffusely echogenic kidneys. 

• 
Earlier presentations have worse prognosis, with fetal diagnosis often causing severe oligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia. ARPKD is associated with hepatic fibrosis, especially when ARPKD manifests later in childhood. The degree of hepatic fibrosis is inversely related to the severity of renal disease. 




Malignant solid renal masses 
Wilms tumor 



Contrast-enhanced axial CT images through the kidneys show near complete replacement of the left kidney by a dominant mass (yellow arrows) containing central foci of necrosis. There is extension into and expansion of the left renal vein (red arrows) and inferior vena cava (blue arrows). Given the presence of lung metastasis, this represents Stage IV Wilms tumor. 
Case courtesy Michael Callahan, MD, Boston Children’s Hospital. 
• 
Wilms tumor is the most common childhood renal malignancy, typically affecting children between 3–5 years of age. Almost 90% of renal tumors in the first decade of life are Wilms tumors; in the second decade, the incidence of Wilms and RCC is equal. Wilms arises from persistent metanephric blastema. 

• 
Patients with increased risk for Wilms tumor are screened with regular ultrasound until school age, and include patients with: 


Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome: hemihypertrophy, macroglossia, omphalocele, neonatal hypoglycemia (due to insulin overproduction by pancreatic ß-cells), and increased risk of childhood malignancies, including Wilms tumor and hepatoblastoma. 
WAGR syndrome: Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and mental retardation. Horseshoe kidney: approximately 2x incidence of Wilms tumor. Trisomy 18. 
Wilms tumor (continued) 
• 
The classic imaging appearance of Wilms is a heterogeneous, solid renal mass. The claw sign indicates renal parenchyma origin. Tumor venous extension is seen in 5–10%. Calcifications may be present but are uncommon. A cystic variant may mimic benign multilocular cystic nephroma. 

• 
Liver or lung metastases are each seen in approximately 10%. Bone metastases are not common, and when present in a pediatric renal mass are more suggestive of clear cell sarcoma. 

• 
Staging of Wilms tumor uses the National Wilms Tumor Study (NWTS) system, which is a combination of radiologic and post-surgical findings: 


Stage I: Completely resected mass confined to the kidney. Two-year survival: 95% 
Stage II: Completely resected mass with spread to nearby structures (e.g., renal capsule or blood vessels). Two-year survival: 90% 
Stage III: Incompletely resected mass with spread to nearby intra-abdominal structures. Two-year survival: 85% 
Stage IV: Hematogenous metastases (e.g., to lung, liver, bone, or brain) or lymphatic metastases outside of the abdomen or pelvis. Two-year survival: 55% 
Stage V (unique to Wilms): Bilateral Wilms at the time of diagnosis (approximately 5–10%). Two-year survival: Variable. 

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) 
• 
Although far more common in adults, renal cell cancer (RCC) does occur in older children and adolescents, usually presenting at age 10–12 years. Overall, <1% of all RCCs occur in children, typically in the setting of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. 

• 
Renal medullary carcinoma is an especially aggressive variant of RCC affecting patients with sickle cell trait. 



Rhabdoid tumor 
• 
Rhabdoid tumor is a rare, aggressive malignancy that may occur in the brain or kidney. 

• 
Imaging shows an ill-defined, aggressive renal mass. Renal and CNS lesions may be concurrent. 

• 
These lesions are typically seen in the first year of life, and have the worst prognosis of all pediatric renal tumors. 

• 
The classic ultrasound and cross-sectional finding is a subcapsular fluid crescent, reflecting renal hemorrhage. 



Clear cell sarcoma 
• Clear cell sarcoma is an uncommon renal cancer with propensity to metastasize to bone. 
Renal metastases 
• 
The most common primary malignancies to metastasize to the kidneys in children are neuroblastoma, leukemia, and lymphoma. 

• 
Leukemia is characteristically infiltrative, diffuse, and bilateral. 

• 
Lymphoma has multiple imaging presentations, including multiple masses or diffuse infiltration. 





Benign solid renal masses 
Mesoblastic nephroma 
• 
Mesoblastic nephroma is a benign tumor that appears identical to Wilms by imaging, but occurs in younger children typically =1 year old. 

• 
Although benign, mesoblastic nephroma is always removed surgically since the classic and more aggressive variants cannot be reliably distinguished radiographically.  They are predominantly distinguished from Wilms tumor by the age of the child. 

• 
Like Wilms tumor, mesoblastic nephroma arises from persistent metanephric blastema. 

• 
Mesoblastic nephroma should not be confused with multilocular cystic nephroma, which is a cystic renal mass with a bimodal age distribution, and is not related to the metanephric blastema. 



Nephroblastomatosis 


Nephroblastomatosis: Sagittal ultrasound (left image) of the right kidney shows marked lobular enlargement of the kidney and reduced echogenicity of the renal cortex. Axial contrast-enhanced CT (right) shows bilateral nephromegaly and numerous lobulated, relatively low attenuation rounded nodules and masses (arrows). 
Case courtesy Michael Callahan, MD, Boston Children’s Hospital. 
• 
Nephroblastomatosis is the persistence of metanephric blastema. The term nephrogenic rest is used when metanephric blastema persists beyond 36 weeks gestation. 

• 
On imaging, nephroblastomatosis may appear as a discrete, homogeneous, nonenhancing renal mass with a hypodense rind. Nephroblastomatosis is commonly multifocal, confluent, and bilateral. 


• Nephroblastomatosis is a precursor to Wilms tumor, so frequent screening is performed. Worrisome findings on screening include rapid growth, inhomogeneity, increased sphericity and enhancement. Nephroblastomatosis may be peripheral or central. While rare, the latter tends to more frequently 
progress to Wilms tumor. Nephroblastomatosis is present in 30% of all Wilms nephrectomies, and in all cases of bilateral Wilms tumors. 
Angiomyolipoma (AML) 
• 
Angiomyolipoma (AML) is a benign renal tumor with elements of blood vessels (angio), muscle (myo), and fat (lipoma). Multiple AMLs are associated with tuberous sclerosis. 

• 
Most AMLs feature macroscopic fat, which is visible on CT or MRI. An AML larger than 4 cm has a risk of hemorrhage. 





Confusing names 
Metanephric blastema 
• 
Metanephric blastema is one of the two embryologic tissues that forms the genitourinary system. Metanephric blastema develops into the renal parenchyma, while the ureteric bud forms the collecting system. 

• 
If metanephric blastema persists after embryogenesis, it can lead to: 


Mesoblastic nephroma, a benign tumor that arises from persistent metanephric blastema. Its appearance mimics Wilms but it occurs in neonates. 
Nephroblastomatosis, which is benign persistent metanephric blastema manifesting as single, multiple, or confluent homogeneous renal masses. Nephroblastomatosis has an increased risk of Wilms tumor. 
Wilms tumor, an aggressive renal malignancy that is the most common childhood renal neoplasm. It typically occurs in children between the ages of 3 and 5 years old. 

Multilocular cystic nephroma 
• 
Multilocular cystic nephroma does not arise from mesonephric blastema and is not related to mesoblastic nephroma. 

• 
Multilocular cystic nephroma is a cystic renal mass with a bimodal age distribution, seen in young boys and middle-aged women.

Sickle cell disease? 

Adrenal mass lesions 
Neuroblastoma 

Chest radiograph shows a subtle abnormal right Coronal contrast-enhanced CT shows a diffusely paradiaphragmatic contour (arrows), which does not enhancing right paraspinal mass (arrow), without silhouette with the heart, suggestive of a posterior calcification or expansion into the spinal canal. mediastinal mass. 


• 
Neuroblastoma is a primitive neural crest cell malignancy that arises from the sympathetic chain, most commonly from the adrenal gland, followed by the extra-adrenal retroperitoneum and posterior mediastinum. 

• 
It is the most common extracranial solid childhood malignancy, presenting between 1–5 years of age (mean age of 2 years). 

• 
Associations included NF-1, Hirschsprung, DiGeorge, and Beckwith-Wiedeman. 


Unilateral agenesis is associated with reproductive anomalies (Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome) including unicornuate uterus, absent epididymis and vas deferens, and seminal vesicle cysts. A paraneoplastic syndrome termed opsoclonus-myoclonus may be seen, featuring nystagmus (dancing 
eyes) and ataxia (dancing feet). It is more frequently associated with thoracic primary lesions. 
• A typical CT appearance of an adrenal neuroblastoma is a suprarenal mass, with calcifications seen in ~50%. Neuroblastoma tends to encase vessels, while Wilms tumor is known to displace and narrow vessels. 
Neuroblastoma (continued) 
• 
On MRI, neuroblastoma often invades into neural foramina and the spinal canal. Diffusion is often restricted, reflecting hypercellularity. 

• 
Neuroblastoma is a catecholamine-secreting tumor and therefore positive on I-123 MIBG scintigraphy. 


Other catecholamine-secreting tumors (pheochromocytoma, carcinoid and medullary thyroid cancer) are rare in children. 
• 
Metastases may be found in 75% of patients and commonly involve the bone marrow (typically permeative and lytic). A classic presentation of metastatic neuroblastoma is an intracranial, subdural mass originating from the marrow. 

• 
The prior International Neuroblasoma Staging System (INSS, 1993) for neuroblastoma surgical staging may be helpful to know, and is summarized below. “Midline” is defined as the contralateral edge of the vertebral body (i.e., for a left neuroblastoma, “midline” is the right lateral edge of the vertebral body) 


Stage I: Tumor limited to organ of origin (e.g., adrenal). 75% two-year survival. Stage II: Local spread (nodes may be positive), but no disease crossing midline. 75% two-year survival. Stage III: Local spread, crosses midline. 25% two-year survival. Stage IV: Distant metastases. 25% two-year survival. Stage IVS: Stage I or II with metastases confined to skin, liver, and bone marrow, and age <1 year (better 
prognosis than Stage III or IV). May also apply to children up to 18 months. 75% two-year survival. 
• A more recent system by the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG, 2009) features a set of image-defined risk factors (IDRF), such as invasion into adjacent organs, bones or vessels, to stage the extent of disease. 
Stage L1: Localized tumor, not involving vital structures defined in IDRF and confined to one body compartment. 95% survival rate. Stage L2: Locoregional tumor with presence of 1+ IDRF. 
Stage M: Distant metastases (excluding stage MS), with 10–30% survival rate. Stage MS: Metastatic disease confined to skin, liver and/or bone marrow disease in children less than 18 months. More favorable prognosis with 75–100% survival rate. 
Ganglioneuroma 
• 
Ganglioneuroma is a benign neurogenic tumor that appears similar to neuroblastoma on imaging. Ganglioneuroblastoma is intermediate in biological behavior between benign ganglioneuroma and malignant neuroblastoma. It is thought that neuroblastoma may differentiate into either of these lesions. 

• 
In contrast to neuroblastoma, ganglioneuroma affects slightly older children (most common age of a ganglioneuroma patient is 6 years old) and only 50% of ganglioneuromas are positive on I-123 MIBG scintigraphy. MRI classically shows restricted diffusion of a neuroblastoma, but not in ganglioneuroma. 




Adrenal hemorrhage (in neonates) 
• 
Adrenal hemorrhage is the most common adrenal “mass” in neonates, and most often associated with difficult deliveries or perinatal stress related to maternal diabetes, breech delivery and sepsis. 

• 
It is typically diagnosed by ultrasound as a hypoechoic avascular suprarenal mass. Hemorrhage may appear similar to neuroblastoma on initial ultrasound, but a follow-up scan would demonstrate involution. Old hemorrhage may calcify. 



Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) 
• 
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) encompasses a group of enzymatic disorders in the synthesis of cortisol, most commonly deficiency in 21-hydroxylase. 

• 
Patients can present with abnormalities in genital development and salt imbalance. 

• 
Imaging findings suggestive of CAH include uniformly enlarged size (length >20 mm or limb width >4 mm), and cerebriform appearance. 


Adrenal cortical carcinoma 

Adrenocortical carcinoma: Coronal (left image) and axial (right) contrast-enhanced CT shows a heterogeneously enhancing suprarenal mass invading into the liver parenchyma with a focus of coarse calcification (arrow). 
• 
Adrenal cortical carcinoma is an extremely rare disease, with a prevalence of approximately 1–2 cases per million per year. When occurring in children, it may be associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann and Li-Fraumeni syndromes. 

• 
Adrenal cortical carcinoma has a bimodal age distribution, seen in children younger than 5 years old and adults in their fourth and fifth decades. 




Cystic pelvic masses 
• The differential diagnosis for cystic pediatric pelvic masses depends on the sex of the child. A pediatric cystic pelvic mass is most likely due to a congenital genitourinary anomaly. 
Either sex 
•A urachal anomaly results from incomplete obliteration of the embryologic allantois. The urachus is the remnant of the allantois, which connects the urinary bladder to the umbilical cord. There is a risk of adenocarcinoma if a urachal anomaly is not resected. 
Patent urachus (most common): Connection between bladder and umbilicus (vesico-cutaneous fistula). Urachal cyst: Noncommunicating cyst in between the bladder and umbilicus. Urachal sinus: Blind-ending sinus at umbilicus. Vesicourachal diverticulum: Blind-ending bladder diverticulum. 
•A rectal duplication cyst is a rare type of gastrointestinal duplication cyst, usually occurring in the retrorectal space. They are typically resected due to malignant potential. 
Girls only 
•A dilated fluid or blood-filled vagina and/or uterus may be in response to hormonal stimulation and outflow obstruction, either in the neonatal period (fluid-filled) or at puberty (blood-filled). 
Hydrometrocolpos: Vagina and uterus dilated with fluid. Hydrocolpos: Vagina dilated with fluid. Hematometrocolpos: Dilated vagina and uterus filled with blood; occurs at menarche with vaginal outflow tract obstruction (e.g., congenital imperforate hymen). 
• Ovarian dermoid cyst, otherwise known as a mature cystic teratoma. 
Boys only 
•A Müllerian duct cyst is caused by incomplete regression of the Müllerian ducts. In a normal male, the Müllerian ducts regress. A persistent Müllerian duct remnant can cause a Müllerian duct cyst. 
In a normal female, Müllerian ducts (paramesonephric ducts) develop into the fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and upper vagina. 
• The prostatic utricle is a normal midline structure that is the terminal remnant of the Müllerian duct. It arises from the posterior urethra near the verumontanum (ridge of the posterior urethra near the seminal vesicle insertion). When associated with hypospadia (urethra opens along the ventral penile shaft), a prostatic utricle can become very large. 


Solid pelvic masses 
• Solid pelvic masses are less likely to represent genitourinary anomalies, and are more concerning for neoplasm. 
Rhabdomyosarcoma 
• 
Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common sarcoma of childhood, occurring equally commonly in the pelvis (bladder, vagina, cervix, uterus, etc.) and head and neck (together making up almost 80% of cases). 

• 
Imaging features a characteristic lobulated bunch of grapes appearance (Botryoid variant). 


Sacrococcygeal teratoma 
• 
Sacrococcygeal teratoma is usually apparent on pre-natal imaging. When detected after birth the characteristic clinical appearance is a skin-covered mass extending from the midline buttocks. 

• 
Sacrococcygeal teratoma has a heterogeneous imaging appearance with cystic, solid, and fatty components.
