Pediatric Neuroimaging 
Neonatal brain imaging 
Germinal matrix hemorrhage 
• 
Germinal matrix is the subependymal site of neuronal precursor cells which initially lines the entire ventricular system, but regresses after the first trimester, becoming concentrated in the caudothalamic groove. It is nearly involuted by 32 weeks gestation. 

• 
Germinal matrix hemorrhage occurs in premature infants less than 32 weeks gestation. 

• 
Germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage grading system: 


Grade I: Hemorrhage confined to the germinal matrix. Grade II: Hemorrhage extends into the ventricles without ventriculomegaly. Grade III: Hemorrhage extends into the ventricles with ventriculomegaly. Parenchymal hemorrhagic infarction: This can coexist with any grade. 
• The previously termed “Grade IV” (intraventricular and parenchymal hemorrhage) is now recognized as periventricular hemorrhagic infarction resulting from venous obstruction and congestion, rather than extraventricular extension of hemorrhage. 

Grade I germinal matrix hemorrhage: 
Sagittal (left image) and coronal (right) ultrasound demonstrates a rounded hyperechoic focus (arrows) at the left caudothalamic groove, representing germinal matrix hemorrhage. The lateral ventricles are not enlarged. 

Germinal matrix hemorrhage with intraventricular and parenchymal hemorrhage: 
Sagittal ultrasound (left image) shows a large amount of echogenic hemorrhage extending from the region of the right caudothalamic groove into the lateral ventricle. Coronal ultrasound (right image) shows intraventricular extension of hemorrhage and intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right parietal lobe. There is associated ventriculomegaly. 


Myelination and cortical development 
Pattern of myelination 
• 
A full-term newborn will have myelination seen in several structures at birth, including: Posterior limb of internal capsules, middle cerebellar peduncle, ventrolateral thalami, dorsal brainstem, and the perirolandic regions. 

• 
Myelination is most apparent at birth on T1-weighted images. On T1-weighted images myelin is bright; on T2-weighted images myelin is dark. 

• 
Myelination generally assumes a mature pattern by age two, although the frontal lobes continue to myelinate through adolescence. 


Overview of cortical development 
• 
Primitive brain forms around the primordial ventricular system, which is lined by pluripotent stem cells called germinal matrix cells. 

• 
Development of normal cortex is dependent on both germinal matrix cell migration and subsequent organization into the normal 6-layered lamination of the cortex. 




Congenital malformations 
Polymicrogyria 
• 
Polymicrogyria is a malformation of cortical development characterized by a derangement of the normal 6- layered organization of the cortex, which leads to too many gyri and too few sulci. 

• 
Polymicrogyria is thought to be caused by disturbance either late in neuronal migration or early in cortical lamellar organization. 

• 
Polymicrogyria may be caused by in-utero infection (especially CMV), in-utero ischemia, or genetic causes. In many cases, no cause is found. Clinical manifestations include developmental delay, focal neurological signs and symptoms, quadriparesis, or epilepsy. 

• 
On MR imaging, the cortex appears thick with an irregularly bumpy surface and high-resolution imaging can resolve multiple small individual gyri. The polymicrogyric cortex looks thin and bumpy in unmyelinated regions, and thicker and smoother in myelinated areas of the brain. 

• 
Bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria is the most common distribution. 




Lissencephaly 
• 
Lissencephaly is characterized by absent or decreased cortical convolutions causing a smooth, thickened cortical surface. In classic lissencephaly, instead of the normal 6-layered cortex, the cortex is arranged into 4 primitive layers. Lissencephaly is thought to result due to an arrested band of neurons, which have not completed outward migration to the superficial cortex. 

• 
Most lissencephalies are the result of genetic mutations encoding tubulins, actins, and microtubule-associated proteins like doublecortin DCX, LIS1, dyneins and kinesins. 

• 
Clinically, patients with lissencephaly almost universally have seizures. 

• 
Classic lissencephaly is genetically and embryologically distinct from cobblestone malformations (sometimes called lissencephaly type II). Cobblestone lissencephaly results from neuronal overmigration through gaps in the pial limiting membrane and is associated with cerebellar and ocular malformations and muscular dystrophy (Walker-Warburg syndrome). 

• 
Type I (classical) lissencephaly is characterized by a smooth cortex and a configuration of the cerebral hemispheres that has been likened to an hour-glass or a figure-of-8. 



T1-weighted (left image) and T2-weighted (right image) MR images demonstrate classical (type I) lissencephaly with a completely smooth cortex and an hour-glass or figure-of-8 configuration to the cerebral hemispheres. 
• Type II (cobblestone) lissencephaly is characterized by a finely undulating cortex. 

T1-weighted (left image) and T2-weighted (right image) MR images demonstrate cobblestone malformation (type II) lissencephaly with a gently lobulated external cortex and a finely undulating or serrated interface at the gray-white junction. 

Gray matter heterotopia 
• 
Gray matter heterotopia is a range of disorders characterized by clusters of normal neurons in abnormal locations caused by arrested radial migration of neurons. 

• 
Gray matter heterotopia may be a cause of seizures. 

• 
Gray matter heterotopia may be isolated or associated with other structural anomalies. 

• 
Three main subtypes include periventricular (subependymal) nodular heterotopia, focal subcortical heterotopia, and leptomeningeal heterotopia. 



Agenesis / hypogenesis of the corpus callosum 
• 
Agenesis of the corpus callosum is a relatively common congenital abnormality. The most common clinical manifestations of agenesis of the corpus callosum are refractory seizures and/or developmental delay. 

• 
Complete agenesis of the corpus callosum causes secondary abnormalities in ventricular morphology: 



Colpocephaly (dilation of the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles) may result from decreased white matter volume posteriorly. 
The lateral ventricles are often parallel in orientation and widely spaced. 
Medial impressions on the lateral ventricles are caused by Probst bundles, which are axons that would normally constitute the corpus callosum, but instead pursue an aberrant course parallel to the interhemispheric fissure. 
The third ventricle may be enlarged and high-riding. 
• 
The anterior corpus callosum develops first followed by the posterior portion. The anterior and posterior callosum develop separately and eventually unite to form a single structure. Various degrees of corpus callosal hypogenesis may occur, the most common being absence of the splenium. 

• 
Congenital corpus callosal anomalies are often associated with other midline abnormalities including a midline lipoma or interhemispheric cyst. 



Callosal hypoplasia and midline lipoma: Sagittal T1-weighted MRI (left image) shows hypoplasia of the corpus callosum with a large midline lipoma (yellow arrow). Axial T2-weighted MRI (right image) shows the lipoma (yellow arrow) and parallel orientation of the lateral ventricles (red arrows) due to the callosal hypoplasia. 
Schizencephaly 

Open-lip schizencephaly: Axial (left image) and coronal (right image) T2-weighted MRI demonstrate a cleft in the left temporoparietal cortex (arrows) extending from the cortical surface to the left lateral ventricle. The cleft is lined by dysplastic-appearing gray matter. 
• Schizencephaly is a malformation characterized by a full-thickness cleft of the cerebral hemisphere lined by dysplastic gray matter (usually from polymicrogyria), extending through the entire cerebral mantle, from the ependymal lining of the ventricle to the pial covering of the cortex. 
Schizencephaly does not directly communicate with the subarachnoid space due to the presence of a roofing membrane covering the cleft, which is thought to be composed of a combination of ependymal, pial, and arachnoid tissues. 
• 
Schizencephaly is associated with cortical malformations (gray matter heterotopia), with up to 30% of patients with schizencephaly also having cortical malformations. 

• 
Schizencephaly has been morphologically classified into open-lip (walls of the cleft are entirely divided by CSF) and closed-lip (walls of the cleft are opposed or incompletely divided). 

• 
Schizencephaly is associated with septo-optic dysplasia, which is characterized by agenesis of the septum pellucidum, optic nerve hypoplasia and pituitary gland abnormalities. 

• 
The characteristic imaging finding of schizencephaly is a CSF-filled cortical cleft lined by gray matter. 

• 
There are several other entities that can cause an interruption or cleft in the cortex, but only a schizencephalic cleft is lined by gray matter. Other cortical clefts include: 


Porencephaly (encephaloclastic): a smooth-walled cavity without surrounding gliosis, usually caused by cortical destruction in the early second trimester. Encephalomalacia. Surgical resection cavity. 

Holoprosencephaly 
• 
Holoprosencephaly is a complex congenital malformation where the forebrain does not divide into two hemispheres. 

• 
Holoprosencephaly is associated with midline maxillofacial anomalies including a single large central incisor (megaincisor) and hypotelorism. It is commonly said that “the brain predicts the face.” Holoprosencephaly may be associated with an azygous configuration of the anterior cerebral artery (single ACA). 

• 
The three subtypes (from most severe to least severe) are alobar, semilobar, and lobar. However, these divisions are far from distinct and holoprosencephalies represent a continuum of forebrain malformations, such that there is clear demarcation between the various subtypes. 


Alobar holoprosencephaly is the most severe form, characterized by complete lack of separation of the cerebral hemispheres. A single large monoventricle almost always communicates with a large dorsal cyst. 

Sagittal T1-weighted (left image) and axial T2-weighted MRI (right image) demonstrate severe alobar holoprosencephaly. There is continual frontal lobe cortex across midline. A midline monoventricle  communicates with a dominant dorsal cyst. 
Semilobar holoprosencephaly features at least some degree of separation of the posterior cerebral hemispheres. Similar to alobar holoprosencephaly, the anterior hemispheres also fail to separate. 

Axial and coronal T2-weighted MRI (left and middle images) and sagittal T1-weighted MRI (right image) show semilobar holoprosencephaly. There is partial separation of the posterior cerebral cortex, with complete fusion of the frontal lobes. There is a large midline posterior interhemispheric cyst. 
Lobar holoprosencephaly is the mildest form, where only the most rostral aspects of the frontal neocortex are not separated. The corpus callosum is absent in the affected region anteriorly, but the posterior corpus callosum (splenium and posterior body) is present. 


Posterior fossa malformations 
Chiari I malformation 

Borderline tonsillar ectopia: Sagittal T1-weighted MRI Chiari I in a different patient: Sagittal T2-weighted shows pointed cerebellar tonsils extending inferiorly MRI shows inferior extension of the cerebellar tonsils below the foramen magnum (yellow arrow). There is (yellow arrow). The presence of syringomyelia (red no hydrocephalus or cervical spine syringomyelia. arrow) allows more confident diagnosis of Chiari I. 
• 
Chiari I is inferior displacement of the cerebellar tonsils beyond the foramen magnum. 

• 
The clinical manifestation of Chiari I is variable and ranges from occasional exertional headaches in an otherwise normal individual to severe myelopathy and brainstem compromise. In babies, Chiari I may be associated with sleep apnea and feeding problems. 

• 
The most common complications of Chiari I are cervical syringomyelia and less commonly 


hydrocephalus. Syringomyelia, also called syringohydromyelia or syrinx, is fluid within the spinal cord. Syringomyelia most commonly represents dilation of the central canal of the spinal cord, which normally 
extends from the obex of the fourth ventricle to the filum terminale. The syringomyelia associated with Chiari I is fusiform dilation of the central canal that does not 
typically communicate with the fourth ventricle. Other forms of syringomyelia (typically associated with hydrocephalus) may communicate with the fourth ventricle via the central canal. Syringomyelia is seen more commonly in Chiari I malformations with associated skull base anomalies. 
• 
Both clinical diagnosis and diagnostic imaging criteria for Chiari I are controversial. Inferior protrusion of the cerebellar tonsils is a relatively common finding in asymptomatic individuals. Additionally, the clinical symptoms of Chiari I are nonspecific and include headache and malaise, which may not always be attributable to the inferior protrusion of the tonsils. 

• 
The classic criteria for diagnosis is herniation of either cerebellar tonsil by 5 mm, or herniation of both tonsils by 3 mm; however, associated findings allowing a more specific diagnosis include pointed configuration of the cerebellar tonsils, crowding of the posterior fossa, and an associated complication such as cervical spine syringomyelia or hydrocephalus. 

• 
If the only finding is isolated inferior displacement of the tonsils, the term “borderline tonsillar ectopia” is generally preferred. 


Chiari II 
• 
Chiari II is a completely different entity from Chiari I; however, a common feature among all Chiari malformations is inferior displacement of the hindbrain. 

• 
Chiari II malformation is part of a complex malformation involving the hindbrain, spine, and mesoderm of the skull base and spinal column. 

• 
It results from a lowered craniospinal pressure difference, resulting from egress of CSF through an open spinal defect.  

• 
The primary abnormality in Chiari II is herniation of the cerebellar vermis, cerebellar tonsils, and medulla through the foramen magnum, with resultant beaking of the tectum. 

• 
A myelomeningocele is universally present, typically lumbar. 

• 
The fourth ventricle is low in position, elongated and inferiorly displaced. In some cases, the fourth ventricle can herniate posteriorly and inferiorly, behind the medulla and below the vermis, resulting in an encysted fourth ventricle. 

• 
Approximately 80–90% of children with Chiari II have hydrocephalus necessitating shunt placement, due to fourth ventricular obstruction. 

• 
Associated supratentorial anomalies include corpus callosal dysgenesis, heterotopias, and sulcation abnormalities. 


Dandy-Walker complex 
• 
The classic Dandy-Walker malformation is identified by hypoplasia or absence of the cerebellar vermis, hypoplastic cerebellar hemispheres, and a large fluid-filled fourth ventricle within an enlarged posterior fossa with high tentorium and elevated torcula Heterophili. 

• 
An in-utero insult to the developing fourth ventricle is thought to result in fourth ventricular outflow obstruction, cyst-like dilation of the fourth ventricle (which communicates with a retrocerebellar cyst), and resultant inferior vermain hypoplasia. 

• 
Most patients have hydrocephalus. 

• 
Upwards displacement of the tentorium by the enlarged fourth ventricle and posterior fossa cyst causes torcular-lambdoid inversion. The torcular herophili is the confluence of the transverse and the straight sinuses, which is pushed superiorly, above the lambdoid suture. 







Phakomatoses 
Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) / von Recklinghausen disease 

Axial T2-weighted axial MRI through the cerebellum Coronal T2-weighted MRI of the lumbar demonstrates T2 hyperintense “unidentified bright objects” spine shows the characteristic target of neurofibromatosis representing myelin vacuolization appearance of plexiform neurofibromas (red (yellow arrows). arrows), which are T2 hyperintense with 
central hypointensity. 
• 
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), also known as von Recklinghausen disease, is a multisystemic neurocutaneous disorder with prominent skin manifestation (e.g., café au lait spots), peripheral nerve sheath tumors (e.g., plexiform neurofibroma), CNS malignancies (e.g., optic nerve glioma), and bony abnormalities (e.g., sphenoid wing dysplasia). 

• 
NF1 is autosomal dominant in 50% of cases and occurs sporadically in 50%, caused by a defect in chromosome 17. 

• 
In children, “bright spots” or “unidentified bright objects” are almost universally seen on T2- weighted images, thought to be caused by myelin vacuolization. These bright spots are seen most commonly in children aged 4–12 and become less prominent in adults. 

• 
Neurofibromas are WHO grade I nerve sheath tumors. The cutaneous and subcutaneous nerves are more commonly involved than the more proximal peripheral nerves. A plexiform subtype is more aggressive and consists of a network of fusiform-shaped masses, with malignant degeneration reported in approximately 5%. 


Like schwannomas, neurofibromas are likely of Schwann cell origin. 
The target sign can be seen with either neurofibromas or schwannomas, and reflects central T2 hypointensity thought to be due to a fibrocollagenous core. The target sign is suggestive of benignity. In contrast to schwannomas, neurofibromas are not encapsulated and involve the entire cross-sectional 
area of the nerve. If a neurofibroma is resected, the parent nerve must therefore be sacrificed. 
• NF1 is associated with multiple brain neoplasms: 
Optic nerve glioma (50% of these tumors are associated with NF1). Juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma. Brainstem glioma. 
Neurofi bromatosis 1 (NF1) / von Recklinghausen disease (continued) 
• Bone manifestations of NF1 include: 
Sphenoid wing dysplasia, which may produce pulsatile enophthalmos or exophthalmos. Posterior vertebral body scalloping. Rib notching (twisted ribbon ribs) due to erosion from neurofibromas of the intercostal nerves. Focal gigantism. Cervical kyphoscoliosis, with a characteristic acute angle. Neural foraminal enlargement, either due to bony dysplasia or a neurofibroma. Tibial bowing. 
• 
Eye manifestations of NF1 include hamartomas of the iris, known as Lisch nodules. 

• 
NF1 is also associated with multiple extra-cranial neoplasms: 



Multiple cranial nerve schwannomas and meningioma in NF2: Axial (right image) and coronal (left image) post-contrast T1-weighted MRI show enhancing bilateral cerebellopontine angle masses extending into the internal auditory canals, consistent with vestibulocochlear schwannomas (yellow arrows). Other schwannomas arising from the trigeminal nerve are partially visualized along the margins of the cavernous sinuses (red arrow). Large right atrial enhancing mass is seen on the coronal image consistent with a meningioma (blue arrow). 
• 
Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder completely unrelated to NF1. Despite the name, neurofibromas are not a component of NF2. NF2 is caused by a defect on chromosome 22 and is approximately 10 times less common than NF1. 

• 
NF2 is characterized by the MISME mnemonic: Multiple Inherited Schwannomas, Meningiomas, and Ependymomas. 

• 
The typical clinical presentation of NF2 is hearing loss caused by bilateral vestibular schwannomas. The presence of bilateral vestibular schwannomas is diagnostic of NF2. 


Sturge Weber 


• Sturge Weber is a neurocutaneous disorder characterized by facial port-wine stain (capillary malformation), ocular abnormalities, and failure of development of normal cortical venous development. 
The port-wine stain typically involves the forehead and upper eyelid, corresponding to the region innervated by the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve (V1). 
• 
Sturge-Weber is a vascular disorder, thought to be caused by failure of regression of the primitive embryologic cephalic venous plexus. This developmental anomaly results in the formation of leptomeningeal venous angiomatosis, which is a vascular malformation characterized by dilated capillaries and venules. 

• 
The underlying vascular anomaly ultimately leads to chronic ischemia, cortical atrophy, and cortical calcification. 

• 
Clinically, patients may have some degree of developmental delay and seizures; however, up to 50% of patients may have normal intelligence. Seizures and developmental delay tend to occur together. 

• 
Characteristic imaging findings are cortical atrophy and subcortical parenchymal calcifications, which are best seen on CT. Contrast-enhanced MRI demonstrates pial enhancement in regions affected by the leptomeningeal venous angiomatosis. The choroid plexi are typically enlarged from compensatory hypertrophy thought to be related to increased flow. 



Tuberous sclerosis 
• 
Tuberous sclerosis is a hamartomatous disorder affecting several organ systems, with multiple skin manifestations. 

• 
The classical clinical triad of adenoma sebaceum (nodular rash originating in the nasolabial folds), seizures, and mental retardation is not always present. 

• 
Clinically, most patients have epilepsy, neurocognitive dysfunction, and pervasive developmental disorders. 

• 
Neuroimaging features multiple T2 hyperintense white matter cortical or subcortical tubers (hamartomas) and subependymal nodules. 

• 
15% of patients develop subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), which may appear on imaging as a newly enhancing or enlarging subependymal nodule. 

• 
Extracranial manifestations include: 


Renal: Multiple angiomyolipomas. Cardiac: Rhabdomyoma. Lung: Lymphangioleiomyomatosis. 

Midbrain malformations  
Joubert and related syndrome  
• A “molar tooth” configuration of the midbrain  
can be seen in several diseases, including  
Joubert syndrome and related disorders  
(JSRD).  
• JSRD clinically present as a hypotonic child  
with developmental delay and ataxia. These  
disorders are often associated with ocular  
anomalies.  
 
• The primary abnormality of Joubert syndrome  
is thought to be aplasia or hypoplasia of the  
cerebellar vermis. Dysplastic cerebellar tissue  
is often present.  
• Unlike Dandy–Walker complex, hydrocephalus  
or a large posterior fossa cyst are uncommon.  Axial T2-weighted MRI shows a characteristic  
“molar tooth” configuration of the midbrain  
(arrows) in a patient with Joubert syndrome. This  
patient also had a small posterior fossa cyst.
