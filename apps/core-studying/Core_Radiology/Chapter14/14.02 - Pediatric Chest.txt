Pediatric Chest 
Medical respiratory distress in the newborn 

• 
Multiple processes can cause respiratory distress in a neonate, including pulmonary disease, congenital heart disease, thoracic mass, airway disorders, skeletal abnormalities, vascular anomalies, etc. 

• 
Despite this broad range, there are 4 classic considerations for a newborn with “medical respiratory distress” – that is, a baby that appears anatomically normal by radiograph (i.e.,without cardiomegaly or thoracic mass), but has a diffuse pulmonary abnormality. 


Surfactant defi ciency disease (SDD) / Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) / Hyaline membrane disease 

Surfactant deficiency disease: Frontal radiograph in a premature infant shows hazy, granular pulmonary opacities and low lung volumes. The baby is intubated, with partially visualized nasogastric tube, umbilical venous, and umbilical arterial catheters.

• 
SDD is the most common cause of respiratory distress and death in pre-term infants. 

• 
It is caused by insufficient surfactant (due to immature type II pneumocytes) and resultant decreased lung compliance. 

• 
Greater than 95% of cases are seen in pre-term infants born before 34 weeks. Less commonly, term babies born to diabetic mothers or via Caesarean delivery have increased prevalence of SDD. 

• 
Imaging is characterized by low lung volumes (prior to intubation) with diffuse hazy granular opacities, air-bronchograms and no pleural effusions. 


Surfactant replacement therapy may result in rapid decrease in granular opacification and improved lung volume. Differential diagnosis for granular opacities in a newborn is neonatal pneumonia (i.e., Group B strep.), which typically also features pleural effusions. 
• Pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE) is a condition often associated with SDD, where barotrauma causes air to dissect through the immature alveoli into the interstitial space and spread along the lymphatic pathways. It usually occurs in the first week of life. 
The radiographic appearance of PIE is hyperinflated lungs with asymmetric bubbly and tubular lucencies representing dissecting air bubbles. PIE may lead to pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. Rarely, it may also cause large intrapulmonary pneumatoceles. 
Treatment of PIE includes switching ventilation modes, high-frequency oscillating ventilation (unique to pediatrics) and placing the patient on affected side down. 
• Chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity / bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD): SDD 
(with or without PIE) lasts for a few days to a week. Beyond that, persistent lung disease is 
concerning for early or evolving CLD which usually presents in the second to third week. CLD is the most common cause of chronic respiratory failure in pediatric patients. CLD is clinically defined as chronic lung disease of premature infants with oxygen dependency longer than 
28 days of life and failed oxygen challenge at 36 weeks post-conception. Unlike SDD, CLD features mild hyperinflation and band-like coarse reticular opacities. 


Chronic lung disease of prematurity: Chest radiograph in a 28-day-old infant with a history of prior respiratory distress syndrome shows coarse interstitial opacities and normal to slightly increased lung volumes. An endotracheal tube and two nasogastric tubes are partially visualized.

Transient tachypnea of the newborn: Initial chest radiograph (left image) performed in a full-term neonate following Caesarean delivery shows diffuse linear opacities radiating from the hila and small bilateral pleural effusions. Repeat chest radiograph 20 hours later (right image) demonstrates interval resolution of diffuse linear opacities.

• 
TTN is the most common cause of respiratory distress in neonates. It is caused by lack of clearance of fetal lung fluid by prostaglandins, which normally dilate pulmonary lymphatics to absorb excess fluid. 

• 
Prostaglandin imbalance can be worsened by male sex, Caesarean delivery (lack of “vaginal squeeze”), or maternal asthma, diabetes or sedation. 

• 
Symptoms of dyspnea usually occur during the first 6 hours, peak at 24 hours and resolve by 48–72 hours. 

• 
Chest radiograph shows findings of pulmonary edema, often with fluid in the minor fissure, perihilar interstitial opacities, and small pleural effusions. The cardiothymic silhouette may be mildly enlarged. 

• 
TTN can be clinically and radiographically difficult to differentiate from neonatal pneumonia. Therefore, antibiotics are often given initially, although there is no specific treatment for TTN. 




• 
Peripartum meconium aspiration is typically seen in term and post-term neonates. Meconium is a highly irritating mixture of desquamated cells, bile pigments, and pancreatic enzymes that can cause significant respiratory distress. 

• 
Imaging is characterized by bilateral asymmetric areas of hyperinflation and atelectasis, with ropy perihilar and coarse interstitial opacities. The lungs lose compliance and become especially susceptible to barotrauma and pneumothoraces. 

• 
Outcome is variable, with much worse prognosis in the presence of a pneumothorax. 


Neonatal pneumonia 
• 
Unlike the previously described entities, which present with immediate respiratory distress, neonatal pneumonia takes hours to days to develop. The most common pathogens are group B streptococcus, S. aureus, and E. coli, which are acquired at birth from the vaginal flora. 

• 
In neonatal pneumonia, the infection is not confined to the lung and is thought to represent neonatal sepsis. 

• 
Typical signs of adult pneumonia, such as fever or elevated white count, are not reliable in neonates. Therefore, it can be difficult to distinguish between neonatal pneumonia and TTN. A history of prolonged rupture of membranes or known maternal infection may suggest neonatal pneumonia. 

• 
Radiographic features of low lung volumes and granular opacities are similar to SDD, but patchy asymmetric perihilar opacities and pleural effusions can suggest pneumonia. 




Congenital structural thoracic disease 
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) 
• 
CDH represents herniation of abdominal contents into the thorax, most commonly through a left posterior defect in the diaphragm (Bochdalek = back). 

• 
The primary complication is ipsilateral pulmonary hypoplasia. Depending on the severity of the defect, contralateral hypoplasia may be present if the lung is compressed in utero. 

• 
Right-sided lesions with liver herniations are rare and have a poor prognosis. 

• 
The key imaging finding is a mass in the thorax displacing the mediastinum. At birth, the herniated bowel may be fluid-filled and appear solid. However, shortly after birth, air fills the bowel to create the typical appearance shown to the right. 

• 
CDH is associated with bowel malrotation (95%), neural tube defects, congenital heart disease, Turner syndrome and Trisomy 21. 



Overview of bronchopulmonary foregut malformations 
normal vasculature 

abnormal vasculature 


abnormal lung 

• Bronchopulmonary foregut malformations describe a range of congenital abnormalities of the embryonic foregut, which represent an inverse spectrum of normal to abnormal vasculature with normal to abnormal pulmonary parenchyma. 
Congenital lobar hyperinflation (CLH), a lesion of abnormal lung development without an associated vascular anomaly. Bronchial atresia is typically diagnosed later in life, and has been postulated to represent previously undiagnosed CLH. 
Bronchogenic cyst, typically incidental, solitary, unilocular and fluid-filled mass which lacks communication to the airway. Air within a bronchogenic cyst therefore suggests infection or fistula. 
Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), previously called congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation. 
Bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS), aberrant lung tissue with anomalous systemic blood supply and no connection to the bronchial tree. 
Scimitar syndrome, a form of partial anomalous pulmonary venous return. 
Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an anomalous connection between the pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins, is a purely vascular malformation without any abnormal lung development. 

Congenital lobar hyperinflation: Chest radiograph (left image) shows a hyperlucent right lung with scant vascular markings and mediastinal shift to the left. Axial CT (right) shows a massively hyperexpanded right middle lobe, which has herniated across midline and exerts mass effect on the heart and bilateral lower lobes.

• 
Congenital lobar hyperinflation (CLH) or overinflation (CLO), formerly congenital lobar emphysema (CLE), is a syndrome of lobar air trapping caused by intrinsic or extrinsic bronchial narrowing without associated destruction of lung parenchyma. 

• 
The most common cause of CLH is bronchomalacia, which results in airway collapse on expiration, leading to hyperinflation. CT can be performed to evaluate for a cause of bronchial obstruction, which is only found in about half of the cases of CLH. 

• 
CLH usually involves the upper and middle lobes. 

• 
In the pre-natal period, CLH is initially fluid-filled and appears as an echogenic mass. Post-natally and as fluid clears, CLH appears as a hyperlucent and hyperexpanded lobe that can exert mass effect on surrounding structures and result in mediastinal shift. It is essential not to mistake CLH for a tension pneumothorax, as a chest tube will increase respiratory distress. 



Bronchial atresia 

Bronchial atresia: Coronal CT shows hyperlucency of the left lower lobe (yellow arrows). There is a globular, well-defined opacity (red arrow) in the left lower lobe representing a mucocele of the atretic left lower lobe bronchus. This case is slightly atypical in that the left lower lobe is affected. 
Case courtesy Ritu R. Gill, MD, MPH, Brigham 
and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Bronchial atresia is interruption of a lobar, segmental or subsegmental bronchus with resultant blind-ended bronchus and associated distal mucus impaction and hyperinflation. 

• 
The left upper lobe is the most commonly affected. 

• 
Bronchial atresia is usually incidentally diagnosed in adults and may be related to CLH in etiology. 

• 
The bronchi distal to the atretic segment become filled with mucus that cannot be cleared, ultimately forming a tubular mucocele (finger in glove). The distal airways are ventilated through collateral pathways and demonstrate air trapping, resulting in local hyperinflation. 

• 
Imaging shows a geographic region of hyperlucent lung with air trapping. A mucous plug may be visible just distal to the obstructed bronchial segment. 


Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (AVM) 
• 
A pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a purely vascular malformation representing anomalous connection between the pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins. 

• 
About 60% of cases are associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu disease). 

• 
Patients can present with cyanosis, clubbing, dyspnea, hemoptysis and polycythemia. 

• 
There is an association with Glenn-shunting prior to the completion of the Fontan circulation due to the lack of hepaticized blood flow. 


Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) / congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) 

CPAM: Axial (left image) and coronal (right) CT images show a large, multicystic mass in the right upper lung (arrows) with both large and small cysts, representing a mixed type I and type II CPAM. 
• 
Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), previously termed congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM), is a hamartomatous proliferation of terminal bronchioles that communicate with the bronchial tree. 

• 
The arterial supply of CPAM arises from the pulmonary circulation. In contrast, sequestration (discussed below) derives its blood supply from the systemic circulation. 

• 
The original classification (Stocker, revised in 2002) is important to be aware of, but the prognosis of CPAM depends more on the size of the lesion rather than its classification. 


Type I: One or more large cysts >2 cm. Most common form. Type II: Multiple thin-walled small cysts. Can be associated with renal agenesis. Type III: Solid-appearing with innumerable tiny cysts (<5 mm). Type IV: Single large cyst, may be indistinguishable from a cystic pleuropulmonary blastoma, a rare 
malignancy that is the most common primary childhood lung tumor. 
• CPAM may exert mass effect and is prone to infection. Surgery is usually recommended as they are difficult to differentiate from pleuropulmonary blastoma.

Sequestration: Axial CT shows a left lower lobe soft tissue mass abutting the aorta (arrow). 
Thoracic aortogram demonstrates a large feeding artery arising directly off the aorta (arrow). 
Case courtesy Michael Callahan, MD, Boston Children’s Hospital. 
• 
Sequestration is aberrant lung tissue with anomalous systemic blood supply, usually arising from the thoracic aorta. The key imaging finding is a systemic feeding artery, which can be seen by Doppler ultrasound pre-natally, or by CTA or MRA post-natally. The most common location is the left lower lobe. In contrast to CPAM, sequestration is usually solid, though hybrid lesions with both CPAM and BPS components do exist. 

• 
Two types of sequestration, intralobar and extralobar, are usually distinguished by CT or MR: 



Intralobar (75%): Inside pleura, usually with pulmonary venous drainage (or left atrium). • Onset in adolescence/adulthood with recurrent pneumonia or hemoptysis. • In contrast to extralobar sequestration, it is rarely associated with other developmental anomalies. • All occur above the diaphragm, most commonly in the left lower lobe.  
Extralobar (25%): External to the pleura, with primarily systemic venous drainage (IVC or azygous). • Onset in infancy with respiratory compromise related to associated anomalies (CDH, CPAM, congenital heart disease, pulmonary hypoplasia, vertebral anomalies). • These may be subdiaphragmatic, i.e., near the adrenal gland mimicking an adrenal mass.  

Scimitar syndrome 

Scimitar syndrome: Frontal chest radiograph (left image) shows a curvilinear opacity extending from the right hilum towards the diaphragm, representing the scimitar sign (arrow). Coronal contrast-enhanced CT (right image) shows the anomalous scimitar vein draining into the inferior vena cava, consistent with partial anomalous pulmonary venous return. 
Case courtesy Michael Hanley, MD, University of Virginia Health System. 
• Scimitar syndrome represents partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR) from right lower lobe pulmonary veins into either the right atrium or IVC. 
In contrast to PAPVR, in total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR), all 4 pulmonary veins return blood to the right atrium, and an obligate right-to-left shunt is necessary for survival. 
• 
The anomalous vein appears like a “scimitar” or Turkish sword on the frontal radiograph, representing the scimitar sign. 

• 
Scimitar syndrome can be associated with hypoplasia and hyperlucency of the right lung (although this finding is not demonstrated in the case above). 





Small airways disease 
Bronchiolitis 

Bronchiolitis: Frontal and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate bilateral hyperexpanded lungs with increased perihilar markings and peribronchial cuffing. 
• 
Bronchiolitis is an infection of the lower respiratory tract, most commonly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). It is mostly seen in children under the age of 5 years and is the leading cause of infant hospitalization in the United States. 

• 
Inflammation of bronchiolar epithelium leads to peribronchial infiltration by inflammatory cells. The resultant necrotic debris may lead to small airway obstruction, the hallmark of bronchiolitis. 

• 
Clinically, bronchiolitis presents as increased work of breathing and wheezing in a child, usually with a viral upper respiratory prodrome. It is primarily a clinical diagnosis. 


• Radiographic findings include hyperexpanded lungs (best seen as flattening of the diaphragms on the lateral view) with scattered areas of atelectasis, increased perihilar peribronchial markings and peribronchial cuffing. These findings are subjective, with high variability among even experienced pediatric radiologists. Similar radiographic findings in an older patient population may represent reactive airways disease. 
It is important to exclude bacterial pneumonia which features focal airspace consolidation with air bronchograms and pleural effusions. Round pneumonia, most often caused by S. pneumoniae and seen in children less than 8 years of age, is typically seen as a round pulmonary opacity with well-defined margins mimicking a mass. 

Bronchiolitis obliterans: Axial CT shows mosaic perfusion with geographic regions of ground glass attenuation. 
This is an example in an adult; however, the findings are similar in children. 
Case courtesy Ritu R. Gill, MD, MPH, Brigham 
and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is the final common pathway of small airway obstruction by inflammatory and fibrous tissue, which may be due to multiple etiologies. BOS may be post-transplant in origin, post-infectious (typically following viral or atypical bacterial pneumonia), or related to toxin or drug exposures. 

• 
BOS is one of the most clinically important complications of pediatric allogeneic lung and bone marrow transplantation. 

• 
Chest radiographs are usually normal or may show mild hyperinflation. 

• 
CT demonstrates findings of small airways obstruction, including 


Air trapping on expiratory views. Mosaic perfusion. Bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening. 
• Swyer-James-MacLeod syndrome is an acquired complication in up to 1/3 of young patients with post-infectious BOS. Abnormal pulmonary development secondary to BOS leads to a unilateral hyperlucent lung with volume loss. 
The key radiographic feature is a small ipsilateral, hyperlucent lung with diminished vascular markings. Note that Swyer-James-MacLeod is not a sequela of viral bronchiolitis (of which RSV is the most common cause), but is only seen after BOS, classically triggered by adenovirus infection or Mycoplasma pneumoniae. 
Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) = bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) 
• 
Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) is a disorder of the distal airways characterized by filling of the bronchioles and alveoli with granulation tissue polyps. Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is an older term for the same entity, and is often confused with bronchiolitis obliterans which is a completely different disease. 

• 
The underlying histologic changes of COP are referred to as organizing pneumonia (OP). COP is the clinical syndrome of OP of unknown cause. OP may be secondary to infection, drug reaction, or inhalation. OP may also be a complication of stem cell transplant, but much less commonly than BOS. 

• 
Radiographic features of COP/OP include multifocal migratory consolidations, ground glass opacities, and nodules. The atoll or reverse halo sign is thought to be relatively specific for OP and features a central lucency surrounded by ground glass. 

• 
Bronchiectasis is bronchial dilation, most commonly due to inflammation. 

• 
It can have a variety of causes in the pediatric population: 


Cystic fibrosis. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Post-infectious. Tracheobronchomegaly (Mounier-Kuhn). Aspiration. Intralobar sequestration, possibly due to 
recurrent infections. 
• The signet ring sign describes enlargement of the bronchiole, which appears larger than the adjacent pulmonary artery branch. 



Unilateral hyperlucent lung 
• A unilateral hyperlucent lung is a common finding in pediatric chest radiology. The two most important acute diagnoses are endobronchial foreign body and pneumothorax. 

Acute shortness of breath? Persistent expansion of dependent lung on decubitus views? 

Acute shortness of breath? Pleural line? 

Prior history of bronchiolitis obliterans? 

Primarily upper and middle lobes? History of recurrent infections? 

Abnormality of the chest wall on the physical exam or lateral radiograph? History of arm/hand anomalies? 

Poland syndrome 
• Poland syndrome is an autosomal recessive syndrome of unilateral congenital absence (complete or partial) of the pectoralis major muscle. Associated anomalies of the ipsilateral arm and hand, including short metacarpals and syndactyly (joined fingers), may be present. 


Pediatric mediastinal masses 
• 
An approach to mediastinal masses, including the relevant anatomy and division of the three main compartments (anterior, middle, and posterior), is discussed in the thoracic imaging section. 

• 
This brief differential highlights the common mediastinal masses in children. 


Anterior mediastinum 
• Normal thymus can appear large in children up to 5 years of age and is sometimes mistaken as an anterior mediastinal mass. Normal thymus is triangular in shape with undulating margins along the anterior ribs (thymic wave 
sign), inferolateral extension into the minor fissure (thymic sail sign) and relative lucency allowing for visualization of overlapping pulmonary vascular markings. It causes no mass-effect on the trachea. Thymic rebound, which is physiologic regrowth of the thymus after chemotherapy, should also not be mistaken for an anterior mediastinal mass. Thymic rebound can be FDG-avid on PET. 
• 
Lymphoma. 

• 
Germ cell tumor. 

• 
Thymoma (very rare in children). 



Middle mediastinum 
• 
Foregut duplication cyst, including bronchogenic or enteric cysts. 

• 
Neurenteric cysts, which are often associated with vertebral anomalies. 

• 
Lymphadenopathy, most often from lymphoma or granulomatous disease (tuberculosis or fungal). 



Posterior mediastinum 
• Neurogenic tumors (90% of masses), including neuroblastoma (most common, under age two), ganglioneuroblastoma, and ganglioneuroma (least common). 


Miscellaneous 
Pneumomediastinum 

Spinnaker sail sign of pneumomediastinum: 
Frontal chest radiograph in an intubated neonate demonstrates elevation of both thymic lobes (arrows). 
Case courtesy Michael Hanley, MD, University of Virginia Health System. 
• 
The spinnaker sail sign is seen in pneumomediastinum and represents the thymus lifted off the mediastinum by the ectopic air. This is also called the angel-wing sign and should not be confused with the sail sign, which is the rightward extension of the normal thymus. 

• 
Endotracheal tube (ETT) positioning should be intrathoracic. The flexion/extension of the neck is significant to note when positioning is borderline. 

• 
Umbilical venous catheter (UVC) courses 


from the umbilical vein directly up to the left portal vein, ductus venosus, and middle or left hepatic vein, ideally terminating in the suprahepatic IVC just below the right atrium. 
UVC positioned within the portal vein can cause portal vein thrombosis and potential liver infarct. 
• Umbilical artery catheter (UAC) originates at the umbilical artery and initially descends into the internal iliac artery, then ascends the common iliac artery and abdominal aorta where the tip ideally terminates at T6–10 (high) or L3–L5 (low). 
The goal is to avoid branches of the aortic arch and abdominal aorta to prevent thrombosis. 
• 
Percutaneously inserted central catheter (PICC) placed via an upper extremity approach should terminate in the distal SVC, while one placed via a lower extremity approach should terminate in the IVC just inferior to the right atrium. 

• 
Extracorporeal membrane exchange (ECMO) devices can be categorized into two types. 


Venoarterial (VA): right internal jugular and right common carotid arteries are usually cannulated. A feared complication of VA catheterization is backing out of the cannula, during which the child can exsanguinate.  
Venovenous (VV): single right internal jugular catheter terminates in the right atrium. 

Normal course of umbilical venous/arterial catheters: 
Frontal radiograph shows an umbilical venous catheter coursing directly upward in the right hemiabdomen to terminate at the inferior cavoatrial junction (yellow arrow). 
An umbilical arterial catheter is seen initially descending prior to coursing upward to terminate between T6–T10 (red arrow). Note endotracheal tube tip is malpositioned in the right mainstem bronchus (blue arrow).
