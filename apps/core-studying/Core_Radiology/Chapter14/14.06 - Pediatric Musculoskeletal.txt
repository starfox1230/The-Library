Pediatric Musculoskeletal 
Fractures in children 
• 
Pediatric bones are more elastic than adult bones, and therefore tend to “bend” (i.e., buckle, greenstick and plastic fractures) rather than “break”. 

• 
There is a general timeline for dating pediatric fractures: periosteal reaction in less than 1 week and complete healing around 12 weeks. 


Exceptions include metaphyseal, skull and costochondral junction fractures which often heal without periosteal reaction. When the radiographic diagnosis is equivocal, repeat radiographs can be performed in 7–10 days, when 
periosteal reaction is expected to be visible. 
Physiology of the physis 
• 
The physis, commonly known as the growth plate, consists of 4 histological zones of cartilage arranged in layers. 

• 
The zone closest to the metaphysis is the zone of provisional calcification, composed of chondrocytes that undergo apoptosis after preparing the matrix for calcification. New bone subsequently forms along the scaffolding formed by these chondrocytes, leading to longitudinal growth. 


Salter Harris classification 

Type I Type II Type III Type IV Type V 
physeal injury only fracture through fracture through fracture through physis completely 
may be radiographically metaphysis epiphysis metaphysis and crushed occult, or may show subtle epiphysis physeal widening 
• 
The unfused physis is the weakest part of the developing skeleton. An injury that can cause a ligament sprain in an adult may result in physeal fracture in a child. 

• 
The Salter Harris (SH) system classifies physeal fractures based on involvement of physis and adjacent epiphysis and metaphysis. In general, the higher the classification, the greater the chance of growth disturbance. 

• 
Type I: Injury limited to the physis. SH I injuries are often radiographically occult if the epiphysis is not displaced. The physis may be 


asymmetrically widened. In the absence of physeal widening, the diagnosis of a SH I injury can be suggested based on soft tissue swelling around the physis. Comparison views may be helpful. 
Examples: Slipped capital femoral epiphysis and gymnast’s wrist (physeal widening caused by chronic stress on the wrist, which may mimic rickets). 
Salter Harris classification (continued) 
• Type II: Fracture extends to metaphysis. This is the most common type (75% of cases). 
Salter Harris II fracture: 
Radiograph of the hand shows a nondisplaced fracture of the ulnar aspect of the base of the third proximal phalanx (arrow), which extends to the physis. 
Case courtesy Michael Hanley, MD, University of Virginia Health System. 
• Type III: Fracture extends to epiphysis and is intra-articular. There is a risk for growth arrest, and surgery may be needed to maintain alignment. Example: Juvenile tillaux fracture, a distal tibial epiphyseal and physeal fracture. 





Salter Harris classifi cation (continued) 
• Type V: Physis is crushed. 
The injury mechanism is often from axial loading. These fractures are easy to miss, and often found in retrospect from prior comparison studies. Comparison views may be helpful if clinical suspicion is high. Prognosis is very poor.

Pediatric elbow 
• Six separate ossification centers, each appearing at different stages of development, make evaluation of the pediatric elbow challenging. However, the cartilaginous ossification centers generally ossify in the same order, which can be remembered with the mnemonic CRITOE and approximate age at ossification in sequential odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11):

˜exed lateral view 

Pediatric elbow (continued) 
• An elbow effusion, as evidenced by displacement of the anterior and/or posterior fat pads 
(posterior more sensitive), is highly suggestive of a fracture, even if no fracture is visible. The anterior fat pad is normally visible as a thin linear lucency at the distal humerus. The posterior fat pad is not normally visible and when present indicates joint effusion. 

Lateral radiograph of the elbow shows a posterior fat pad sign indicative of an elbow effusion (yellow arrow). Bony protuberance along the posterior humerus (red arrow) represents a supracondylar fracture. 
• The elbow alignment is evaluated with the anterior humeral and radiocapitellar lines. 
Anterior humeral line: Drawn along the anterior humeral cortex, the anterior humeral line should pass through the middle of the ossified capitellum on the lateral view. If abnormal, suggests supracondylar fracture. 
Radiocapitellar line: Drawn through the radial shaft, the radiocapitellar line should pass through the capitellum on all views. If abnormal, suggests elbow dislocation or a nursemaid’s elbow. 

• Supracondylar humerus fracture is the most common pediatric elbow fracture. Lateral condyle fracture is the second most common fracture, followed by medial epicondyle avulsion. In contrast, the most common adult elbow fracture is of the radial head.

Radial buckle fracture 

Distal radial buckle fracture: Frontal wrist radiograph demonstrates subtle irregularity and angulation of the distal radial cortex (arrow), representing an angled buckle fracture. 
• 
Buckle fractures are unique to the pediatric skeleton, representing a buckling of cortex rather than a cortical discontinuity. 

• 
Buckle fractures can be subtle on imaging and sometimes are only detected by careful inspection of the cortex. Normally, the cortex should be so smooth that a virtual marble can roll down the cortex without bouncing off. Any focal cortical irregularity in a child should raise concern for a buckle fracture. 


Toddler’s fracture 
• 
Toddler’s fracture is a nondisplaced oblique fracture through the tibial metadiaphysis, caused by a rotational force to the leg. It typically occurs in toddlers as they learn how to walk. 

• 
Toddler’s fracture may be clinically difficult to diagnose. Oblique views significantly increase sensitivity. 

• 
Radiograph shows a hairline spiral lucency through the distal tibia. 

• 
Nondisplaced fractures of the cuboid and calcaneus represent variant toddler's fracture and can be subtle, manifesting as faint radiodense bands. This typically reflects superimposition of trabeculae rather than fracture. 



Toddler’s fracture: Frontal radiograph of the lower leg shows a spiral lucent line through the distal tibia (yellow arrow), with a sclerotic component extending to the epiphysis (red arrow). 
Pelvic apophyseal avulsion injuries 
• 
An apophysis is an ossification center at a site of tendinous attachment; it is a growth plate that does not contribute to longitudinal growth. There are 5 pelvic apophyses and two proximal femoral apophyses, which arise in puberty and fuse by the third decade. The apophyses are the weakest link of the myotendinous unit. Pelvic apophyses close relatively late in skeletal development and are therefore susceptible to avulsion. Apophyseal avulsion fractures occur most commonly in athletic adolescents, who have strong muscles and open apophyses. 

• 
Acute injuries appear as an avulsed bone fragment. Subacute avulsions are more complex appearing, as the donor site may undergo mixed lytic and sclerotic change. This can have an aggressive appearance. 

• 
Avulsion injuries may be subtle as they are Salter-Harris I equivalent fractures. There is often minimal or no displacement of the otherwise normal-appearing apophyseal ossification.

Child abuse / non-accidental trauma (NAT) 
Overview of imaging for child abuse 
• 
If there is clinical or radiographic concern for child abuse, a complete skeletal survey using high-resolution bone technique (for children under two years of age) should be performed, including frontal views of all long bones, rib views with obliques, skull, pelvis, hands/feet, and entire spine. The images are reviewed by the radiologist while the child is still in the department. 

• 
Bone scintigraphy is more sensitive for posterior rib fractures, but has higher radiation dose than radiography, is insensitive for skull fractures, and cannot evaluate fracture morphology for age. 

• 
The age of fractures is estimated by the presence of callus formation. In general, a fracture is 


less than two weeks old if there is no callus, and at least one week old if there is callus. These estimates are rough guidelines. A younger child will form callus and heal more quickly.  The speed of healing is also altered in the setting of malnourishment, which sometimes accompanies 
neglect and/or abuse. 
Highly specific fractures (but not the most common fractures) 
• These fractures are highly specific for child abuse. If any of these fractures are seen, immediate concern must be raised for child abuse. 
highly specific fractures
for child abuse 
• Classic metaphyseal lesion (also called metaphyseal corner fracture or bucket handle fracture) is highly specific for abuse, and is a circumferential fracture through the peripheral spongiosa bone of the distal metaphysis, most commonly around the knee or ankle. A classic metaphyseal lesion is thought to be due to violent shaking or forceful pulling. 
The classic metaphyseal lesion typically heals quickly (within 10 days) without callus formation, so prompt radiography is essential for diagnosis. 
• Posterior rib fracture is also highly specific for abuse as a result of squeezing injury, but may be very difficult to diagnose when acute. A repeat chest radiograph with bone technique can be performed in the acute setting, or follow-up radiograph after one week to view interval callus formation. 
Unlike in adults, rib fractures are not typically seen after CPR in children. In the rare case of rib fractures from CPR, fractures tend to be anterior and lateral, not posterior. 
• 
Scapula fracture. 

• 
Sternum fracture. 

• 
Spinous process fracture. 


Suspicious fractures (but not highly specific) 
• 
These fractures should raise suspicion for child abuse, but are not highly specific. 

• 
More than one fracture. 

• 
Fractures that are discordant with the clinical history. 

• 
Digital fracture in infants. 

• 
Long bone fracture in non-ambulatory child. 

• 
Complex skull fractures that are depressed, multiple, bilateral or crossing sutures. 


Nonspecific (but frequently seen) 
• 
These fractures are commonly seen, both in the setting of child abuse and accidental trauma, but are not specific for child abuse when seen in isolation. 

• 
Linear skull fracture. 

• 
Long bone fracture in ambulatory child. 



Pediatric Hip 
Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) 
• Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is incongruent development of the femoral head- acetabular relationship. An abnormally shallow acetabular angle results in uncovering of the femoral head by the acetabulum. There is an increased incidence of DDH in breech births, so all breech births are typically screened by ultrasound. 
DDH is more commonly seen with oligohydramnios, firstborn infants, girls, and positive family history. 
• 
Physical examination findings include limited range of motion, hip “click” or “clunk”, gluteal or thigh fold asymmetry, and unequal leg lengths. 

• 
Ultrasound is generally performed at or after 6 weeks of age. Imaging is delayed because of the effects of perinatal maternal hormones on neonatal ligamentous laxity. The alpha angle is the angle formed by the bony ilium and acetabular roof, obtained from the coronal hip ultrasound. A normal alpha angle is greater than 60 degrees. The bony portion of the acetabular roof 


should cover at least 50% of the cartilaginous femoral head. An alpha angle <60 degrees or <50% coverage of the femoral head by acetabulum is abnormal, suggesting DDH. 
hip dysplasia: same coronal image with di˜erent annotations alpha angle <60 degrees, femoral head <50% covered by bony acetabulum 

• After femoral head ossification (typically after 6 months of age) radiographs are performed. 
On pelvic radiography, the ossified femoral head should normally sit in the inner lower quadrant formed by the intersection of the Hilgenreiner and Perkins lines. The acetabular angle (white), drawn through the acetabular roof and Hilgenreiner line, is typically under 
30 degrees at birth, and decreases to about 20 degrees or less by age two years. 

Overview of child with limp 
• A limp (abnormal gait pattern caused by pain) should be carefully evaluated and may be secondary to trauma, septic arthritis, chronic fracture, avascular necrosis, or lymphoma. 
Septic hip arthritis 
• 
Infection of the synovium and joint space is an orthopedic emergency as joint destruction and growth arrest may occur without prompt washout and antibiotics. 

• 
Any hip effusion must be urgently aspirated to evaluate for septic arthritis. 

• 
The primary differential consideration for septic arthritis is aseptic transient synovitis, which is a self-limited diagnosis of exclusion and typically seen in children 3–8 years old following a viral infection. Less common causes of hip effusion and limp include hemarthrosis in trauma or hemophilia (history is usually evident). 

• 
Septic arthritis is usually secondary to hematogenously seeded metaphyseal osteomyelitis that breaks through the periosteum to infect the joint capsule. S. aureus is the most common cause. The hip is the second most commonly affected joint, following the knee. 

• 
Plain film findings are not sensitive or reliable for evaluation of effusion, but include: 


Displacement or distortion of gluteal or psoas fat planes. The gluteus medius and minimus insert on the greater trochanter. The psoas inserts on the lesser trochanter. Widening of the teardrop distance (space between the lateral margin of the pelvic teardrop and the 
medial margin of the femoral head). The teardrop is the antero-inferior acetabulum. 

Hip effusion: AP radiograph shows lateral displacement of the left gluteal fat plane (yellow arrows) and subtle medial bowing of the psoas fat plane (red arrow). The teardrop distance (blue arrows) is not widened, emphasizing the relative insensitivity of these radiographic findings to detect effusion. 
• Ultrasound is the imaging modality of choice. Both sides should be compared for symmetry. The presence of internal echoes within an effusion does not have clinical significance. 

Bilateral hip ultrasound in the same patient shows increased anechoic fluid in the left hip joint (right panel; arrows) relative to the normal right hip. This child ended up having aseptic toxic synovitis, but the radiographic and ultrasound findings are identical to septic arthritis. 
Legg-Calvé-Perthes (LCP) 
• 
Legg-Calvé-Perthes (LCP) disease is avascular necrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis ossification center. LCP is of unknown etiology and typically occurs in small-sized Caucasian boys between the ages of 4 and 8 years. 

• 
LCP is usually unilateral (80%). A systemic cause should be sought when bilateral, such as sickle cell disease or steroids. 

• 
Imaging findings are dependent on stage and chronicity. 

• 
Early LCP can be subtle, and often multiple modalities are used for initial diagnosis. Early LCP may show subtle sclerosis of the femoral head on radiography. There is typically decreased uptake on bone scan. 




• Late LCP shows secondary signs of osteonecrosis. The femoral head becomes flattened and distorted, with secondary changes of osteoarthritis. Bone scan of late LCP typically shows increased uptake due to attempted repair. 

Later stage of LCP in the same patient. This follow-up slightly obliqued frontal radiograph shows increased sclerosis and irregularity of the right femoral head, with new fragmentation (arrows). 
Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) 
• 
Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is a Salter I fracture of the proximal femoral epiphysis (with superolateral migration of the femoral metaphysis) classically seen in obese adolescent boys (most between ages 10–16 years). SCFE typically affects children slightly older than those with Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease. 

• 
Initial findings on an AP view can be subtle, including asymmetric widening of the proximal femoral growth plate and lack of intersection of Klein’s line with the femoral head. Klein’s line is a line drawn along lateral margin of femoral neck, which should normally intersect the 


femoral head, as in the normal right hip below. A radiographic clue to SCFE is lack of intersection (or asymmetric intersection) of Klein’s line with the femoral head. 

Early left SCFE: There is minimal widening of the left physis (arrow) without physeal displacement. There is minimal asymmetry in the alignment of the Klein’s lines (dashed yellow lines). These findings are very subtle. 
• Although Klein’s line is drawn on the AP view, the physeal widening and displacement is best evaluated on the frog-leg lateral projection. 

Frog leg lateral radiograph in the same patient shows very slight medial slippage of the left femoral head and more apparent physeal widening (arrows), suggesting early SCFE. 
• 
The contralateral hip should always be carefully evaluated. SCFE is frequently bilateral, and is usually asymmetric. 

• 
The goal of imaging in SCFE is to identify “preslip” SCFE, in which the epiphysis and metaphysis remain aligned but subtle lucency of the physis suggests physeal edema. These findings are more sensitively identified on MRI. 

• 
Osteonecrosis of the femoral head is the major complication. Treatment is screw fixation. 



Infection and Inflammation 
Osteomyelitis 


Osteomyelitis: Frontal and lateral radiographs of the knee (top left panel) show an irregular lucency (arrows) of the medial proximal tibial metaphysis. 
Coronal fluid-sensitive T2-weighted MRI of both knees shows extensive marrow edema of the proximal left tibial metaphysis extending across the physis into the epiphysis (arrow) and into the soft tissues. The right knee appears normal. 
Anterior and posterior Tc-99m MDP bone scan (bottom left panel) shows increased proximal left tibial uptake (arrow). The bone scan was positive on all three phases (angiographic and blood pool phases not shown). 
Case courtesy Michael Hanley, MD, University of Virginia Health System. 
• 
The initial findings of osteomyelitis are often subtle on radiography and may require a combination of plain radiographs, MRI, and scintigraphy for accurate early diagnosis. 

• 
Osteomyelitis in children is most commonly hematogenous, with the metaphyseal marrow being the most common site of initial seeding where there is abundant blood supply. 


In infants, the epiphysis receives blood supply from transphyseal vessels arising from metaphysis, so infection can cross the physis, resulting in epiphysitis and septic arthritis. In older children, capillaries do not cross physis, so transphyseal extension of a metaphyseal infection is 
uncommon. In adults, as growth plates fuse, infection can again extend into the epiphysis. 
• 
The most common organism implicated in hematogenous osteomyelitis is S. aureus, with Salmonella seen in sickle cell patients. 

• 
The imaging findings on radiography, MRI, and scintigraphy (three-phase bone scan) follow the anatomic progression of infection. The initial hematogenous infection is intramedullary and then subsequently spreads through the cortex and uplifts the periosteum. The pediatric periosteum is only loosely adherent to bone, and the purulent infection is able to dramatically uplift the periosteum, causing a prominent periosteal reaction. 

• 
It usually takes 10–14 days for findings to become evident on radiography. The initial finding may be focal osteopenia due to hyperemia. Subsequently, a lucent, often aggressive- appearing medullary lesion can erode through the cortex and cause periosteal reaction. MRI and scintigraphy are much more sensitive for the detection of early osteomyelitis, with findings seen on bone scan within 24–72 hours of symptom onset. Osteomyelitis is further discussed in the musculoskeletal imaging section. 


Spinal osteomyelitis / discitis 



Discitis with epidural extension. Case courtesy Michael Hanley, MD, University of Virginia Health System. 
• 
Isolated discitis is unique to children, due to the presence of blood vessels directly feeding the intervertebral disc. In adults, infection can spread through the disk, but in children infection begins in the disc. 

• 
A typical clinical history of discitis is a young child up to 4 years old with preceding upper respiratory tract infection and back pain or refusal to sit. Discitis most commonly occurs in the lumbar spine in young children. 

• 
Less commonly, discitis may occur in pre-teen children in the thoracic spine. 

• 
The initial radiographic findings are disc space narrowing and vertebral end plate irregularity. These findings may be subtle. Plain films may also be normal. Because persistent back pain is never normal in children, further evaluation with MRI is recommended if clinical suspicion for discitis is high. 

• 
MRI shows narrowing of the disc space, with bone marrow edema of two adjacent vertebral bodies. The affected vertebral bodies may enhance, and enhancement and edema may extend into the soft tissues and epidural space. 


Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) 
• 
Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a nonpyogenic, inflammatory disorder that can mimic osteomyelitis. It tends to occur in lower extremity long bones. 

• 
CRMO is typically a diagnosis of exclusion and is self-limited. Biopsy may need to be performed to exclude pyogenic infection. 

• 
The key imaging finding is migratory lytic and sclerotic lesions in time and space. CRMO may be indistinguishable from pyogenic osteomyelitis on radiographs and MRI. Unlike infectious osteomyelitis, CRMO does not feature soft tissue abscess, bony sequestra, or fistula. 

• 
CRMO is associated with SAPHO syndrome, characterized by: 


Synovitis 
Hyperostosis 
Acne 
Osteitis 
Pustulosis 
TORCH infections: Syphilis 
• 
Syphilis is caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. Syphilis can be transmitted in utero through the placenta to cause congenital syphilitic osteomyelitis. 

• 
The Wimberger sign is destructive erosion of the medial aspect of the proximal tibial metaphysis. The Wimberger sign is not to be confused with the Wimberger ring sign of scurvy, which is increased density of the ossification centers. 

• 
Syphilis is one of many causes of symmetric periosteal reaction in a child. 



Wimberger sign in congenital syphilis: 
Magnified frontal leg radiograph shows a deep erosion of the medial aspect of the proximal tibia (yellow arrow), representing the Wimberger sign. There is also periosteal reaction along the partially visualized tibial diaphysis (red arrows). 

Childhood arthritis 
Juvenile idopathic arthritis (JIA) / juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) / juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) 
• 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), also known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) and juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA), is the most common chronic arthropathy of childhood. It is a systemic idiopathic disease defined as being present for more than 6 weeks in a patient younger than 16 years old. JIA is usually rheumatoid-factor negative. 

• 
The most common subtype of JIA is pauciarticular disease, typically affecting young girls. Regardless of subtype, the knee is the most commonly affected joint, but any joint can be affected. 

• 
The imaging appearance reflects the underlying pathophysiology of synovitis, as the earliest radiographic changes are joint effusion, soft tissue swelling, and periarticular demineralization. Later changes include joint space narrowing, periostitis and erosions. 

• 
Chronic disease leads to eventual joint ankylosis, which is in contrast to adult rheumatoid arthritis, where ankylosis is rare. The most common sites of ankylosis are in the wrist, at the carpometacarpal joints, and the cervical spine. 


Cervical spine ankylosis in a child may appear similar to Klippel-Feil syndrome. In contrast to Klippel-Feil, JIA does not feature segmentation anomalies. 
• 
Accelerated skeletal maturation and accelerated bone growth are caused by synovitis and hyperemia, which lead to premature fusion of the physes and/or abnormal bone growth. 

• 
Still disease is an acute systemic subtype of JIA affecting children under the age of 5. Still disease presents with fever, anemia, leukocytosis, hepatosplenomegaly, and polyarthritis. Boys and girls are affected equally. 



Skeletal dysplasias 
Overview of skeletal dysplasias 
• 
Bone dysplasias are characterized by impairment of normal growth of bone yielding an abnormal skeleton. The impairment can involve growth slowing down, speeding up, or can cause the bones to grow in an unusual manner. 

• 
Several terms used to describe abnormal limb growth include: 


Rhizomelia: Proximal limb shortening (e.g., humerus or femur too short). Examples of rhizomelic dwarfism include achondroplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia and hypochondroplasia. Mesomelia: Middle limb shortening (e.g., radius or ulna, tibia or fibula too short). Acromelia: Distal limb shortening (e.g., hand or foot too short). An example is Jeune syndrome. Micromelia: Entire limb is shortened. Amelia: Limb is absent. 
Achondroplasia 

Achondroplasia: Abdominal radiograph shows narrowing interpedicular distances in the lower lumbar vertebra (yellow double arrows), tombstone iliac wings (red arrows), and flat acetabula (blue arrows). 
This child also has a nasogastric tube. 
• 
Achondroplasia is the most common skeletal dysplasia and cause of dwarfism. Affected individuals have normal cognitive function and life expectancy. Advanced paternal age is a risk factor. 

• 
Key radiographic findings include abnormal morphology of the lumbosacral spine and pelvis: 


Narrowing of interpedicular distances in the lower spine causes spinal stenosis that is compensated for by a characteristic lumbar lordosis as the child learns to walk. Posterior scalloping of vertebral bodies. Characteristic tombstone iliac wings. 
Flat acetabula, with short femoral necks. Other findings include frontal bossing of the skull, midface hypoplasia, rhizomelic dwarfism (short femurs and humeri) with large trident hands (long third and fourth fingers). 
Thanatophoric dysplasia (lethal) 
• 
Thanatophoric is the most common lethal skeletal dysplasia. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. 

• 
Key radiographic findings are focused on the vertebral bodies and femur: 


Flattening of vertebral bodies (platyspondyly), causing H-shaped vertebral bodies with diffuse narrowing of interpedicular distance. Curved telephone receiver femurs. Other findings include cloverleaf-shaped skull, short ribs, long thorax and small iliac bones. 
Cleidocranial dysostosis 
• 
Cleidocranial dysostosis is a skeletal dysplasia characterized primarily by abnormalities in the clavicles, ribs, cranium and pelvis. Affected patients are of normal intelligence but tend to be short. 

• 
The key radiographic finding is complete or partial absence of the clavicles. 

• 
Cleidocranial dysostosis is strongly associated with wormian bones in the skull. 


Wormian bones are nonspecific, and are also seen in hypothyroidism, osteogenesis imperfecta, healing rickets, and Down syndrome. 

CT scout (left image), and coronal CT (right image) show multiple Wormian bones in a patient with cleidocranial dysostosis. 
Case courtesy Sanjay Prabhu, MBBS, Boston Children’s Hospital. 
• Additional radiographic findings of cleidocranial dysostosis include: Delayed ossification of the skull (neonatal). Widened pubic symphysis (typically not seen until later in life). 
Asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (Jeune syndrome) 
• 
Asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy is an autosomal recessive disorder of a congenitally small bell-shaped thorax causing associated pulmonary dysplasia and respiratory distress. 

• 
Additional bony findings include: Short ribs that are bulbous anteriorly. High-riding handlebar clavicle. Trident acetabulum with iliac wings that are small, short and flared. Normal vertebral bodies, as opposed to flat in thanatophoric dysplasia. 


Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) 
• 
Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) represents a varied spectrum of disorders due to abnormal type I collagen. There are 8 different types, with type I being the mildest and type II being lethal. The remainder range from moderate to severe. 

• 
Clinical findings include blue sclera and hearing impairment due to otosclerosis. It is important to note that a faint blue scleral tinge can also be transiently seen in normal infants. 

• 
Key radiographic findings include multiple fractures in the ribs (causing characteristic 


accordion ribs), vertebral bodies, and long bones. Additional findings include: Bowed long bones. Osteopenia. Wormian bones in skull, secondary to non-coalesced ossification centers in the skull. 
• The differential diagnosis for multiple fractures includes OI, rickets and child abuse. Of these 
three, OI is the only entity to cause antenatal fractures. With rickets one would not expect antenatal injury. Fractures and osteopenia may be present. With child abuse one would not expect osteopenia or antenatal injury. Fractures are typically present. 
Stippled epiphyses 
• Several skeletal dysplasias and metabolic bone diseases can cause stippling of the epiphyses, including: 
Chondrodysplasia punctata, a short-limbed dwarfism (usually rhizomelic). 
Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (Fairbank disease), a mildly short limbed, autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia that usually manifests in late childhood or adolescence. Hypothyroidism. Complications of maternal warfarin use in a newborn. 
Enchondromatoses 
• 
The enchondromatoses are characterized by multiple intra-osseous benign cartilaginous tumors in an asymmetric distribution. These syndromes are associated with an increased risk of malignant transformation to chondrosarcoma (Maffucci > Ollier). 

• 
Ollier disease is an enchondromatosis without associated abnormalities. 

• 
Maffucci syndrome is an enchondromatosis with venous malformations, which cause phleboliths that are evident on radiography. 

• 
Lesions typically demonstrate rings-and-arc chondroid matrix and are most commonly found within the hands and feet, and along the metaphyses of long bones. 


Multiple hereditary exostoses (osteochondromatosis) 
• 
Multiple hereditary exostoses is an autosomal dominant disorder of multiple benign osteochondromas (also called exostoses), which are bony protuberances with corticomedullary continuity growing from the metaphyses of long bones. Lesions are directed away from the joint and most commonly occur in the distal femur, proximal femur and proximal tibia. 

• 
Complications include pain, deformity, and malignant transformation into low-grade chondrosarcoma (between 5–25% of cases). 

• 
In contrast to enchondromatosis, skeletal involvement is usually symmetric bilaterally. 



Mucopolysaccharidoses 
• 
Mucopolysaccharidoses are a group of lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) including Hurlers, Morquio, and Hunters. These disorders share common radiographic findings and are typically distinguished clinically and biochemically. 

• 
Key radiographic findings include oval vertebral bodies with anterior beaking, thickened clavicles and ribs, and undertubulated bones. Other findings include: 


Madelung deformity of the wrists (wedge-shaped proximal carpal row, with radius shifted towards ulna). Thickened calvarium with a J-shaped sella. Pelvis with tall and flared iliac wings (opposite of achondroplasia). Wide tapering metacarpal bones. 
• 
Hurlers features anterior beaking of the vertebral bodies, primarily inferiorly. 

• 
Morquio also features anterior beaking of middle portion of the vertebral body (mnemonic: Morquio for middle). 


Morquio is associated with spinal stenosis and atlantoaxial instability, with most common cause of death being C2 cervical myelopathy. 

Metabolic bone disease 
Rickets

• Rickets is a metabolic bone disorder caused by inadequate vitamin D or abnormal vitamin D metabolism. It is characterized by abnormal calcification at the zone of provisional calcification (ZPC), leading to abnormal physeal development. 
Rickets mostly affects growing bones, though is not seen in newborns as maternal vitamin D is still functional. 
• 
Radiographs show expansion, irregularity, fraying, and cupping of the long bone metaphyses, often associated with adjacent metaphyseal periosteal new bone. 

• 
Other findings of rickets include bowing of the legs, osteopenia, and fractures. The classic rachitic rosary represents anterior cupping of the ribs with widening of the rib epiphyseal cartilage. The skull may become demineralized. 

• 
MR findings demonstrate loss of black-white-black line corresponding to an indistinct ZPC. 

• 
Oncogenic rickets is a variant of rickets seen with hemangiopericytoma or nonossifying fibroma due to tumor metabolites that cause deranged vitamin D metabolism. 


Lead poisoning 
• 
Lead poisoning is the most common heavy metal poisoning in children, usually from ingestion of paint chips in older homes. 

• 
Classic radiographic findings include wide sclerotic metaphyseal bands (lead line), usually in a more rapidly growing long bone. It does not spare the fibula, whereas a normal variant line might. 



Aggressive bone neoplasms 
Osteosarcoma 

Conventional osteosarcoma: Frontal (left image) and oblique (right image) radiographs of the tibia and fibula show a sclerotic lesion of the distal tibia (arrows) associated with cloud-like ossification extending into the soft tissue. This appearance is of a highly aggressive mass.

• 
Osteosarcoma is the most common primary pediatric bone tumor, with a peak incidence of 15–25 years of age. There are over 10 types of osteosarcoma, with the most common subtype the conventional (intramedullary) type, representing 75% of all osteosarcomas. Conventional osteosarcoma is seen most commonly about the knee in the distal femur or proximal tibia. 

• 
The characteristic radiographic appearance of conventional osteosarcoma is a destructive lesion often invading the cortex, with extensive cloud-like osteoid matrix. 


Aggressive periosteal new bone formation results in a spiculated sunburst appearance or uplifting of the periosteum forming a Codman triangle. 
• Osteosarcoma is further discussed in the musculoskeletal imaging section. 
Ewing sarcoma 
• Ewing sarcoma is the second most common primary pediatric bone tumor, with peak incidence slightly younger than that of osteosarcoma (ranging from 5–20 years). It is an aggressive small round blue cell tumor of neuroectodermal differentiation. 
Ewing sarcoma (continued) 
• 
Ewing sarcoma most commonly arises from the femoral diaphysis, followed by the flat bones 

of the pelvis. Ewing may also develop in the tibia, humerus, and ribs. The lung is the most common site of metastasis. 

• 
The characteristic radiographic appearance is a permeative lesion in the medullary cavity with wide zone of transition and associated aggressive lamellated (onion-skinning) or spiculated periosteal reaction. 

• 
Ewing often causes a soft tissue mass which can be difficult to see by radiography. 


Osseous Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) 
• Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is abnormal proliferation of Langerhans cells with a variety of clinical manifestations, ranging from an isolated lytic bony lesion to fulminant systemic disease. 
Langerhans cells are dendritic cells (histiocytes) that normally live in the epidermis and lymph nodes, where they act as antigen-presenting cells. Histopathologically, Birbeck bodies are seen on electron microscopy within the histiocytes. 
• Clinical subtypes of LCH have varied presentations. Eosinophilic granuloma (osseous LCH) features localized skeletal or pulmonary involvement. It may be 
mono- or polyostotic. Despite the name, the involvement of eosinophils is variable. Pulmonary LCH is discussed in the thoracic imaging section. Hand-Schüller-Christian (multifocal, unisystem) is a clinical triad of pituitary hypophysitis (causing diabetes 
insipidus), exophthalmos, and lytic bone lesions (typically affecting the skull). 
Letterer-Siwe (multifocal, multisystem) is a fulminant disease with multisystem involvement, primarily seen in young infants and toddlers under age two. Prognosis is poor. In clinical practice, the most important factor is thought to be determination of unifocal or multifocal 
disease rather than the classification above. 
• 
The eosinophilic granuloma variant of LCH is relatively common and may present clinically with pain, tenderness, and fever, often mimicking osteomyelitis. Children between ages 5–15 are typically affected. 

• 
The appearance of the affected bone depends 


on the bone involved: Skull: Beveled edge or punched-out lytic lesion. Flat bones (e.g., pelvis): Hole within a hole lytic 
lesion. Ribs: Multiple expansile lytic lesions. Long bone (diaphysis most common, but may 
occur anywhere including rarely the epiphysis): Permeative destruction, with wide zone of transition and later lytic lesion and faint rim of sclerosis. 
Spine: Complete vertebral body collapse (vertebra plana), pictured to the right. The differential of vertebra plana in a child also includes lymphoma, chronic osteomyelitis, and OI. 
Maxilla: Floating teeth. 
• Along with infection, eosinophilic granuloma should be considered in the differential diagnosis in any patient under 30 with a lytic lesion anywhere. 

Leukemia 
• 
Leukemia is the most common pediatric malignancy, with bony changes seen in >50% of patients. 

• 
Imaging findings can be varied. One of the most distinctive radiographic features of leukemia is the metaphyseal lucent band. 

• 
The etiology of the lucent bands is controversial, thought to be possibly due to malnutrition or vitamin deficiency in young children. The differential diagnosis of lucent metaphyseal bands includes: 


Leukemia, lymphoma. Neuroblastoma metastases. Severe illness. TORCH infections. Endocrinopathies: Scurvy, rickets 
• Other osseous findings of leukemia include generalized osteopenia or permeative lytic lesions. 


Osteochondroses 
• The osteochondroses are a heterogeneous group of disorders that were at one point thought to be initiated by avascular necrosis. The current understanding is that most of these disorders are secondary to trauma. While many are associated with AVN, it is not thought to be the initiating factor. Most are more common in males. 
Blount disease 
• Blount disease is an osteochondrosis of the proximal 
Infantile Blount tibial metaphysis, causing tibia disease: varus (bowing) and internal Bilateral Blount rotation, which eventually disease with leads to progressive deformity, sloping of the medial
gait deviations, and leg-length 
portions of the
discrepancy. 
proximal tibial 
• The infantile form of Blount disease metaphyses (arrows), is thought to be due to early 
causing tibia 
walking and obesity, and is typically 
varus. 
bilateral. 
• The adolescent form is seen in children over 6 years old and is usually unilateral. 
Madelung deformity 
• Madelung deformity is medial sloping of the distal radius caused by dysplasia of the medial distal radial physis and resultant growth disturbance. 
Panner disease 
• Panner disease is osteochondrosis of the capitellum. 
Little league elbow 
• Little league elbow is osteochondrosis of the medial epicondyle. 
Scheuermann kyphosis 
• Scheuermann kyphosis is a syndrome of avascular necrosis of multiple thoracic vertebral bodies leading to multiple compression fractures. 
Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease 
• Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease is osteochondrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis. 
Kienbock disease 
• Kienbock disease is osteochondrosis of the carpal lunate. 
Osgood-Schlatter disease 
• Osgood-Schlatter disease is osteochondrosis of the tibial tuberosity. 
Freiberg infraction 
• Freiberg infraction is osteochondrosis of the second metatarsal head. 
Kohler disease 
• Kohler disease is a self-limited osteochondrosis of the navicular bone. 
Sever disease 
• Sever disease is calcaneal apophysitis (rather than an osteochondrosis) and is a cause of heel pain. Sclerosis of the calcaneal apophysis is nonspecific and can be seen in asymptomatic children, although greater fragmentation of the apophysis may be associated with pain. 

Periosteal reaction in an infant or child 
• 
The periosteum is a thin membrane covering the entire surface of the bone excluding those areas covered by cartilage. It contributes to bone production and remodeling. Irritation of the periosteum, which can be due to trauma, infection, inflammation, neoplasm, or metabolic disturbance, can cause periosteal reaction. 

• 
The terms “periosteal reaction,” “periostitis,” and “periosteal new bone formation” are commonly used as synonyms. Periosteal reaction is simply a nonspecific response to injury or chronic stress resulting in periosteal new bone production. 

• 
Periosteal reaction may also be associated with tumors or infection, typically producing an aggressive appearance in these disorders. The morphology of aggressive periosteal reaction is discussed in the musculoskeletal imaging section. 


Physiologic subperiosteal new bone formation in a newborn 
• 
Physiologic periosteal reaction occurs in infants 1–4 months old, thought to be due to rapid bone growth and loosely adherent periosteum. 

• 
The periosteal reaction is smooth and thin, and usually only involves the lateral or medial diaphysis of the long bones symmetrically. 


Prostaglandin therapy 
• Neonates on prostaglandin therapy for congenital heart disease (to maintain ductal patency) may have periosteal reaction. Prostaglandins are thought to decrease osteoclast bone resorption. 
Infectious 
• 
Subperiosteal spread of pyogenic infection elevates the periosteum and irritates it, usually causing an aggressive periosteal reaction. 

• 
Congenital syphilis causes periosteal reaction. 


Neoplastic (typically these are aggressive periosteal reactions) 
• Multiple malignancies, including leukemia, neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, and osteosarcoma can produce an aggressive periosteal reaction. 
Trauma 
• Healing fractures (both accidental trauma and child abuse) may cause periosteal reaction. 
Metabolic 
• Rickets, scurvy (which is also characterized by epiphyseal sclerosis – the Wimberger rim sign), and hypervitaminosis A may all cause periosteal reaction. 
Syndromic 
• Multiple syndromes may cause periostitis. Caffey disease (infantile cortical hyperostosis) is a rare inflammatory disease causing periostitis of the mandible, scapula, and clavicle. 



Miscellaneous 
Torticollis 

Torticollis: Bilateral neck ultrasound shows fusiform enlargement of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle (arrow). The right side is normal. 
• Torticollis is caused by fibromatosis coli (idiopathic sternocleidomastoid enlargement) resulting in an inability to fully straighten the neck. It usually resolves with physical therapy. 
Tarsal coalition 
• 
Tarsal coalition is abnormal joining of two normally separate bones in the tarsus. The three types of coalition are fibrous, cartilaginous, and osseous. 

• 
The two most common coalitions (together making up 90% of all tarsal coalitions) are talocalcaneal and calcaneonavicular. 

• 
Tarsal coalition clinically presents as foot pain in the child as the coalition begins to ossify. 

• 
Tarsal coalition is further discussed in the musculoskeletal imaging section. 


Carpal coalition 
• 
Carpal coalition is abnormal joining of carpal bones. 

• 
Carpal coalition is usually asymptomatic but may be a cause of wrist pain. 

• 
Like tarsal coalition, the coalition may be fibrous, cartilaginous, or osseous. 

• 
Lunotriquetral coalition is the most common carpal coalition. 

• 
Capitohamate is the second most common carpal coalition. 



Frontal radiograph of the wrist demonstrates osseous lunotriquetral coalition (arrows).
