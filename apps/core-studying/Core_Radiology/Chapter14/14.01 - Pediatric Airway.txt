
Pediatric Airway 
Anatomy 


Pediatric upper airway obstruction 
• 
Upper airway obstruction above the level of the trachea can be congenital, neoplastic, or infectious. 

• 
Upper airway obstruction can also be classified by anatomic level: Nasopharyngeal (i.e., choanal atresia, rhabdomyosarcoma, adenoidal hypertrophy), or oropharyngeal (i.e., peritonsillar abscess, thyroglossal duct cyst). 


Choanal atresia 
• Choanal atresia is congenital occlusion of the choanae in the posterior nasal cavity. Choanal atresia can be osseous (30%), membranous 
(<1%), or mixed (70%). There is almost always some degree of osseous abnormality. 
• Choanal atresia is often associated with other congenital malformations, most commonly

Pyriform aperture stenosis (PAS) 

Pyriform aperture stenosis: Axial non-contrast CT shows thickening and medialization of the nasal processes of the maxilla (yellow arrows) with resultant narrowing of the frontal opening of the nose, right greater than left. A central maxillary mega-incisor (red arrow) is also seen. 
• 
Pyriform aperture stenosis is a rare but potentially lethal cause of congenital upper airway obstruction that may clinically mimic choanal atresia. 

• 
PAS results from early fusion and hypertrophy of the medial nasal processes, causing narrowing of the pyriform aperture. 

• 
There is an association with other cranial-facial abnormalities, including the presence of holoprosencephaly, central incisor tooth and pituitary dysfunction. 

• 
Key imaging features include overgrowth and medial displacement of the maxillary nasal processes, hypoplasia of the hard palate, and piriform aperture width of less than 11 mm in a term infant. 


Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofi broma (JNA) 
• Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is a highly vascular, benign hamartomatous lesion seen in adolescent males. It typically originates at the sphenopalatine foramen and spreads into the nasopharynx and pterygopalatine fossa, causing bony remodeling along the way. 
The primary differential is nasal rhabdomyosarcoma, which causes bony destruction. For an image of JNA, please refer to the head and neck section in the neuroimaging chapter. 
Nasal rhabdomyosarcoma 
• Nasal rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common childhood soft tissue sarcoma, with the head and neck a common primary site. It presents as a highly aggressive mass. 

Nasal rhabdomyosarcoma: Axial contrast-enhanced CT (left image) and axial fat-suppressed post-contrast T1-weighted MRI at a higher level (right image) shows a destructive, avidly enhancing mass invading the nasopharynx and causing bony destruction of the left posterior wall of the maxillary sinus and pterygoid plates (yellow arrows). There is invasion into the left medial temporal lobe (red arrow) apparent on MRI. 



Stridor (tracheal narrowing) – infectious causes 
Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) 
• 
Croup is a self-limited viral (usually parainfluenza) infection with characteristic inspiratory stridor and barking cough. It affects children ages 6 months to 4 years, peaking at 1–2 years. Clinically, croup and bronchiolitis can present simultaneously. 

• 
Croup is a clinical diagnosis. The purpose of radiography is to evaluate for other causes of stridor, particularly if the patient is not responsive to treatment. 

• 
The steeple sign is seen on the frontal view and represents loss of the normal shouldering of the subglottic trachea. There may be “ballooning” of the hypopharynx on the lateral view.

Epiglottitis 
• 
Epiglottitis is infectious inflammation of the epiglottis. 

• 
A very rare disease in the era of Haemophilus influenzae immunization, epiglottitis is a true emergency as the airway can obstruct without warning. 

• 
While historically seen around the age of 3.5 years, modern cases are more seen in teens or immunocompromised individuals, such as HIV patients or transplant recipients. It is also frequently

inhalation. 
• Classic imaging findings include thickening of the epiglottis (thumbprint sign) and the aryepiglottic folds. It is swelling of the aryepiglottic folds that leads to airway obstruction. 
Note, omega epiglottis is an apparently thickened normal epiglottis when imaged at an oblique angle. The aryepiglottic folds should be normal. 


Retropharyngeal abscess 
• 
Retropharyngeal abscess, a purulent infection of the retropharyngeal space, is a common cause of nontraumatic prevertebral soft tissue swelling in children, typically at ages 6–12 months or 2–4 years. 

• 
As a general rule of thumb, the prevertebral soft tissues should not exceed half the vertebral body width at C1–C3, and one vertebral body width at C4 and below.  Effacement of the normal subglottic step-off between C4–C5 is a worrisome sign. 


Prevertebral pseudothickening can be seen if a radiograph is obtained with poor inspiration or neck flexion.  Airway fluoroscopy may obviate the need for CT by viewing effacement of the prevertebral 
soft tissues in real-time.  
• 
CT is usually necessary to determine the nature of radiographic retropharyngeal swelling. 

• 
The differential of nontraumatic prevertebral swelling also includes retropharyngeal cellulitis, lymphoma, and foregut duplication cyst. 


Retropharyngeal cellulitis appears similar to pharyngeal abscess on radiography, but no drainable fluid collection is seen on CT.  It is most commonly secondary to severe cellulitis or tonsillitis. Air within a retropharyngeal abscess is rare unless a foreign body has perforated the esophagus. 
• Complications include Lemierre syndrome (thrombosis of the internal jugular vein with septic pulmonary emboli) or mediastinitis (mediastinal extension via the danger space). 
Exudative (bacterial) tracheitis 
• 
Exudative tracheitis may present similarly to epiglottitis with fever, stridor, and potentially life-threatening respiratory distress. 

• 
In contrast to croup, exudative tracheitis tends to affect older children (ages 6–10 years) and is bacterial in etiology (most commonly S. aureus). 

• 
On imaging, linear filling defects representing intraluminal membranes may be visible in the subglottic and cervical trachea (candle dripping sign).

Stridor – other causes 
Subglottic hemangioma 
• 
Subglottic hemangioma is a benign vascular neoplasm that produces stridor in infancy. It is the most common pediatric subglottic tracheal mass. 

• 
The classic radiographic finding is asymmetric narrowing of the subglottic trachea on the frontal view (versus symmetric narrowing in croup). 

• 
There is an association with cutaneous hemangiomas and PHACES syndrome. 



Laryngeal papillomatosis 
PHACES syndrome: 
Posterior fossa malformation. Hemangiomas. Arterial anomalies. Coarctation/cardiac defects. Eye abnormalities. Subglottic hemangiomas, sternal 
clefts, supraumbilical raphes. 
• 
Laryngeal papillomatosis is a cause of multiple laryngeal nodules due to HPV infection, resulting in thick and nodular vocal cords. Papillomatosis increases the risk of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), analogous to cervical cancer risk from HPV. 

• 
Papillomas frequently seed the lungs, causing multiple cavitary nodules. These nodules are also at risk for the development of SCC. 


Tracheobronchomalacia

• 
Tracheobronchomalacia causes excessive expiratory airway collapse from weakness of the tracheobronchial cartilage. Tracheobronchomalacia may be either congenital or acquired secondary to intubation, infection, or chronic inflammation. 

• 
A standard inspiratory CT may be normal. Dynamic four-dimensional CT or bronchoscopy are necessary to diagnose tracheobronchomalacia. 

• 
Greater than 50% reduction in cross-sectional area of the airway lumen is suggestive of tracheomalacia, although normal patients may achieve this threshold with a forceful expiration. 

• 
A very common association is with esophageal atresia/tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). 



Tracheal stenosis 
• 
Iatrogenic tracheal stenosis (e.g., due to prolonged intubation) may be a cause of stridor. 

• 
Congenital tracheal stenosis is usually associated with vascular anomalies, discussed in the following section. 



Aspirated foreign body 
• 
Most aspirated foreign bodies are radiolucent, therefore secondary signs of air trapping (lucent hyperinflated lung with atelectasis distally) can be helpful in the diagnosis. 

• 
Decubitus radiographs demonstrate persistent expansion of the dependent lung, signifying obstruction. 

• 
Expiratory fluoroscopic/radiographic images demonstrate persistent expansion and lucency of the obstructed lung, with mediastinal shift away from the affected side. 




Vascular rings and sling 
• 
Rings and slings are important vascular causes of stridor in infancy and childhood. Initial evaluation is typically with barium esophagram, followed by CT or MRI if abnormal. 

• 
A vascular ring refers to complete encircling of the trachea and esophagus by the aortic arch or great vessels. 

• 
A vascular sling refers to an anomalous left pulmonary artery that arises aberrantly from the right pulmonary artery and traps the trachea in a “sling” on three sides. 

• 
An important clue to a vascular cause of stridor is a right-sided aortic arch visualized on frontal radiograph. 


The pulmonary artery sling is the only vascular anomaly that causes stridor in a patient with a normal (left) aortic arch. 
• The three most important vascular causes of stridor are: double aortic arch, right arch with aberrant left subclavian artery, and pulmonary sling. Each of these will show abnormality on the lateral radiograph or esophagram.

Double aortic arch 
• Double aortic arch is the most common vascular ring. The arches encircle both the trachea 
and esophagus, and may cause stridor. The right arch is usually superior and larger than the left. 
• The goal of the radiologist in pre-surgical planning is to determine which arch is dominant (typically with MR), as the non-dominant arch is ligated to alleviate stridor.

The anatomic schematic (left) shows complete encircling of both the trachea and esophagus by the arches, with potential bilateral impressions on the trachea and esophagus. 

Right arch with aberrant left subclavian artery (non-mirror image branching) 
• The second most common vascular ring is a right aortic arch with an aberrant left subclavian artery. The right arch indents the anterior trachea while the aberrant left subclavian artery wraps posteriorly around the esophagus. The ring is completed by the ligamentum arteriosum. 
In contrast, the more common anatomical variant of a left arch with an aberrant right subclavian artery 
(discussed on the next page) is typically asymptomatic and does not comprise a ring. Note that a right aortic arch with mirror image branching features essentially a mirror image of a normal left aortic arch. Greater than 90% of cases are associated with intracardiac defects, including tetralogy of Fallot, truncus arteriosus and double outlet right ventricle. Though typically not a vascular ring, a complete vascular ring can occur when the ductal ligament extends between the descending aorta and left pulmonary artery (“circumflex aortic arch”). 
• Radiographic and fluoroscopic findings are not reliably distinguishable from the double aortic arch described above. CT or MRI are necessary for definitive diagnosis.

Pulmonary sling 
• 
Anomalous origin of the left pulmonary artery arising from the right pulmonary artery forms a sling by coursing between the trachea and esophagus. Usually only the trachea is trapped in the sling, but occasionally the bronchus intermedius may also be compressed. 

• 
This is the only vascular cause of stridor in a patient with a left arch. The aortic branching pattern is normal. 

• 
This entity is associated with tracheal anomalies including tracheomalacia and bronchus suis (RUL bronchus originating from trachea). A “ring-sling” complex may also be present, representing complete cartilaginous rings in the setting of a pulmonary artery sling.

Left aortic arch with aberrant right subclavian artery 
• A left aortic arch with an aberrant right subclavian artery is not a ring or a sling because the ligamentum arteriosum does not impinge upon the trachea or esophagus. It does not cause stridor, but when symptomatic may cause dysphagia (dysphagia lusoria).

Summary of vascular impressions with a posterior esophageal impression 
• Double aortic arch or right arch with aberrant left subclavian artery: 
These two rings may appear identical on the lateral esophagram or radiograph and both will also feature an anterior impression on the trachea. Both entities may cause stridor. 
• Left aortic arch with aberrant right subclavian artery: This entity is rarely symptomatic. It would cause dysphagia if it produced any symptoms at all. Esophageal impression is often smaller compared to the other two above entities. 
Summary of vascular impressions with an anterior esophageal impression 
• Pulmonary artery sling: Pulmonary artery sling is the only vascular ring or sling to produce an anterior impression on the 
esophagus. Since the aberrant pulmonary artery runs between the trachea and esophagus, it also produces a posterior tracheal impression. Pulmonary artery sling is also the only congenital vascular cause of stridor with a left aortic arch.
