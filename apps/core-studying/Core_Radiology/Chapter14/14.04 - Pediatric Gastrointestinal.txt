• 
Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) most commonly affects pre-term infants, thought to be caused by a combination of infection and ischemia related to feeding. NEC may also occur in term infants with congenital heart disease, Hirschsprung disease, an umbilical venous catheter or on immunosuppression. Mortality can be as high as 40%. 

• 
NEC most commonly involves the distal ileum and right colon. Initial radiographic findings include bowel thickening and fixed distention of a loop of bowel over serial exams. 

• 
Later in the disease, pneumatosis, portal venous gas, or pneumoperitoneum related to bowel perforation may be present. Pneumoperitoneum can be difficult to detect on supine radiographs. One should always draw an imaginary line across the liver from right to left – if the liver gets darker, then pneumoperitoneum should 


be considered. Additional lateral decubitus or cross-table lateral radiographs can be obtained for further evaluation. Signs of pneumoperitoneum include the football sign (air outlining the falciform ligament), Rigler’s sign 
(air outlining the serosal and mucosal surface of the bowel) and the telltale triangle (lucent triangle 
outlined by bowel and the peritoneal reflection). Submucosal pneumatosis, in which punctate locules of gas are trapped between the undulated mucosa, is easily confused with intraluminal contents. Subserosal pneumatosis, a linear crescent of gas between the smooth muscular and serosal layers of the bowel, is more specific. 
• 
Early NEC can be treated medically (antibiotics, TPN, and cessation of oral feeding). If pneumoperitoneum is present, emergent surgery is generally required; however, bowel-sparing percutaneous drainage is an emerging option in some cases. 

• 
Once the baby recovers, contrast enema can evaluate for stricture, which is the most common delayed complication of NEC. 



Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: Ultrasound of the pylorus demonstrates a thickened muscular wall (arrows denote the entire pylorus; measurements should be obtained of one wall only, from echogenic mucosa to echogenic serosa, as diagrammed on the annotated image on the right) and an elongated channel length. 
Case courtesy Michael Hanley, MD, University of Virginia Health System. 
• 
Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) is muscular hypertrophy of the pylorus, which classically causes progressive, projectile, non-bilious emesis in firstborn males (affected 4 times more than females) age 2–12 weeks old. HPS is the most common surgically treated cause of vomiting in infants. 

• 
Although there is a genetic association, most cases are sporadic and idiopathic. 

• 
A suggestive plain film finding is the caterpillar sign, which describes the undulating contour of the gastric wall peristalsing against an obstructed pylorus. 

• 
Ultrasound criteria vary by institution; typical criteria for diagnosis include wall thickness >3 mm (measuring from echogenic mucosa to echogenic serosa) and a channel length >15 mm. Positive cases will not show feeds passing through the pylorus. An important pitfall to be aware of is imaging a collapsed, normal gastric antrum. 

• 
Treatment is pyloroplasty, with IV fluid and electrolyte replacement while waiting for surgery. 

• 
The main differential consideration is pylorospasm, for which close clinical follow-up is recommended. Visualization of gastric contents passing through the pylorus is suggestive of pylorospasm, which generally features a normal-appearing pylorus. 


Appendicitis 
• 
Appendicitis is the most common reason to perform abdominal surgery in a child, typically presenting over the age of 4 years and rare in infants. Abdominal pain is usually present, but the clinical presentation in children may be atypical and diagnosis can be challenging. 

• 
Ultrasound is the first test of choice for evaluation of suspected appendicitis in children. A swollen (>6 mm), incompressible, blind-ending tubular structure in the right lower quadrant is a typical imaging appearance. 


The most sensitive sonographic finding of appendicitis is inflamed, echogenic peri-appendiceal fat.  An echogenic and shadowing appendicolith, increased mural vascularity, non-compressibility, and localized reproducible pain with pressure are also reliable signs of appendicitis. 
• MRI is the preferred modality for assessing children after an equivocal ultrasound.  Examination can be performed in roughly 10 minutes, with the most sensitive finding being infiltration of peri-appendiceal fat on T2-weighted, non-fat saturated sequences. 
Malrotation with midgut volvulus: Abdominal radiograph (left image) shows a high bowel obstruction, with dilated proximal bowel and absence of distal bowel gas. Upper GI (right image) of the same patient demonstrates a duodeno-jejunal junction to the right of midline (yellow arrow) and a corkscrew appearance of the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum (red arrow).

the attachment, the less likely the bowel is to pinwheel (volvulize) around its axis. 
• 
Malrotation is the failure of normal rotation of the bowel during embryogenesis, which predisposes to volvulus due to abnormal mesenteric fixation. Malrotation is associated with omphaloceles and heterotaxy syndromes. 

• 
Volvulus is a surgical emergency, with a high mortality rate due to bowel ischemia. Volvulus typically presents with neonatal bilious emesis. 


Although bilious emesis may be due to several entities including non-obstructive gastroenteritis, malrotation with volvulus must be ruled out with an upper GI. 
Note, because bilious emesis can also occur from distal obstruction in neonates, it is essential to exclude a distal obstruction with abdominal radiograph prior to performing an upper GI. Performing an upper GI in a neonate with distal obstruction introduces a high risk of false positives given the laxity of the ligament of Treitz and the distortion by dilated distal loops. 
• Malrotation without volvulus can have nonspecific symptoms, including feeding intolerance, cyclic vomiting, and malabsorption. Therefore, it is essential to consider malrotation in a child with abdominal symptoms. 
75% present in the first month of life and 90% become symptomatic within one year. 
• The most important anatomy to demonstrate on every upper GI is the C-sweep of the 
duodenum and position of the duodeno-jejunal junction (DJJ). On frontal view, normal DJJ should be to the left of the left spinous pedicle at the level of the duodenal 
bulb (L1). 
On the lateral view, the normal duodenum first courses posteriorly into the retroperitoneum, inferiorly while retroperitoneal, anteriorly across the spine (remaining in the retroperitoneum), and then superiorly to meet the jejunum at the DJJ in the peritoneal space. 

Normal upper GI: Spot image shows the duodeno-jejunal junction (arrow) to the left of midline, beyond the left pedicle of the vertebral body.

• 
On abdominal radiography, midgut volvulus most commonly appears as multiple dilated loops of bowel. Less commonly, midgut volvulus may produce a double bubble sign from duodenal obstruction. However, plain films can also be entirely normal in the setting of malrotation and vomiting. 

• 
The classic upper GI findings of midgut volvulus is the corkscrew appearance of twisted bowel. On CT or ultrasound, the superior mesenteric artery may be seen to the right of the superior mesenteric vein. 

• 
In the absence of midgut volvulus, the diagnosis of malrotation can be challenging. The DJJ is a mobile structure and can be manipulated during the upper GI exam. Even experienced pediatric radiologists may occasionally disagree. Some clues to the presence of malrotation include: 


DJJ inferior to the duodenal bulb. DJJ to the right of the left pedicle. Cecum either more midline than typical or frankly in the left lower quadrant. On CT or US: Inversion of normal relationship of SMA and SMV (normally SMV to the right of the SMA). 
Color Doppler ultrasound or CT studies of the twisted mesenteric vessels demonstrates the whirlpool sign. 
• The treatment of malrotation with volvulus is the Ladd procedure: Volvulus reduction, resection of necrotic bowel, and lysis of mesenteric adhesions (“Ladd” bands). The small and large bowel are separated, with the small bowel positioned primarily on the patient’s right 
and the large bowel on the patient’s left. Appendectomy may be performed. 
• 
Intussusception is caused by two telescoping bowel loops prolapsing into each other. The most common location is ileocolic where the ileum prolapses into the colon. 

• 
Intussusception is common and classically presents with colicky abdominal pain, “currant jelly stool,” and a palpable right lower quadrant abdominal mass. 

• 
Most children between 3 months and 3 years old have idiopathic intussusceptions caused by lymphoid hyperplasia from a preceding viral illness. In contrast, intussusception in newborns and children older than 3 years should prompt evaluation for a pathologic lead point, which may be an intestinal polyp, Meckel diverticulum (infants), or lymphoma (children). 

• 
Radiographs are nonspecific, but may show paucity of gas or a soft tissue mass. 

• 
Ultrasound is the primary modality for diagnosis, which shows a characteristic target or pseudokidney sign with alternating layers of bowel wall and mesenteric fat. 


Small bowel to small bowel intussusception is a common incidental finding on ultrasound. They are often asymptomatic, transient and self-resolving. In contrast, ileocolic intussusception typically requires manual reduction.

• 
The first-line treatment is reduction with an air or contrast enema. The choice of air or contrast varies by institution, but air enemas are generally considered safer. 




Intussusception reduction (same patient as the ultrasound above): Initial prone spot radiograph (left image) from an air enema shows a mass in the right lower quadrant (arrows), which spontaneously reduces after continued insufflation of air (right image). 
A surgeon should be present. IV antibiotics are sometimes, but not universally, administered. 
A large-bore needle must be available to decompress a potential tension pneumoperitoneum, which may cause fatal compression of the IVC if untreated. A large enema tip should be used to prevent leakage, which may need to be taped to the skin. Air should be insufflated up to 120 mmHg (between cries; reading during cries will be artificially high). A successful reduction will show rush of air into the small bowel. The rule of 3’s applies to hydrostatic reduction: up to 3 attempts can be performed, up to 3 minutes each. 
If unsuccessful, the patient must go to surgery. 
• Contraindications to pneumatic reduction include peritonitis, pneumoperitoneum, and septic shock. 

Congenital gastroesophageal disorders 
Esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula 
• 
In embryologic development, the primitive trachea and esophagus initially form as one structure. Esophageal atresia (EA) is a blind-ending esophagus caused by faulty embryologic separation of the two structures. 

• 
EA is almost always associated with tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). 

• 
50% of patients with TEF have associated anomalies, most commonly VACTERL: 


Vertebral segmentation anomalies. Anal atresia. Cardiac anomalies. TracheoEsophageal fistula. Renal anomalies. Limb (radial ray) anomalies. 

• 
TEF is also associated with tracheal anomalies including tracheomalacia and bronchus suis (right upper lobe bronchus arising directly from trachea). 

• 
EA should be considered in-utero if there is polyhydramnios and lack of visualization of the stomach. Esophageal atresia: Frontal babygram shows high position 


of the esophageal catheter (arrow) with distal bowel gas, consistent with tracheoesophageal fistula. 
This neonate has VACTERL, with multiple vertebral segmentation anomalies and dextrocardia visible on this radiograph. Not visible on this image are this baby’s anal atresia, unilateral renal agenesis, and a missing thumb.

• 
Gastric atresia represents congenital obstruction of the distal stomach resulting in non-bilious vomiting. In contrast to hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, the vomiting does not get progressively worse. 

• 
A diagnostic imaging finding is the single bubble, with a large bubble of air (or contrast) in the proximal stomach. 

• 
A less severe variant is a nonobstructive antral web. 




Neonatal bowel obstruction: Overview 

Neonatal distal bowel obstruction: Abdominal radiograph shows numerous dilated loops of bowel throughout the entire abdomen. A nasogastric tube is in the stomach. 
• 
Neonatal bowel obstruction, occurring in the first 24–48 hours of life, is a distinct entity from childhood and adult obstruction, with unique etiologies and workup. Unlike in adults, CT plays no role in the workup of neonatal bowel obstruction. 

• 
In the neonate, small bowel cannot be distinguished from large bowel based on location or size of the bowel loops. 

• 
When loops of distended bowel are seen and obstruction is suspected, one can divide the differential into proximal/high or distal/low obstruction (relative to the distal jejunum) based solely on the number of dilated loops seen. 

• 
If the initial radiograph does not provide a definite diagnosis, the imaging test of choice for a proximal obstruction is an upper GI study. All proximal obstructions are surgical. Midgut volvulus must be ruled out. 


A patient with characteristic clinical and imaging findings of duodenal atresia can be diagnosed on radiograph alone. For instance, a baby with known Down syndrome and a double bubble on radiograph is considered diagnostic of duodenal atresia. 
• In contrast, the imaging test of choice for a distal obstruction is a contrast enema, which can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. The goal of imaging in distal obstruction is to differentiate surgical from non-surgical causes. 

Congenital proximal bowel obstruction 
• All causes of congenital proximal bowel obstruction are surgical. The primary purpose of an upper GI is to distinguish between midgut volvulus (requiring emergent surgery) and bowel atresia, which requires a non-emergent repair. 
Duodenal atresia, stenosis, and web 

Duodenal atresia: Abdominal radiograph (left image) shows the classic double bubble sign, with a distended stomach (yellow arrows) and a distended duodenal bulb (red arrows). Upper-GI study (right image) shows a markedly distended duodenum (red arrows) and no contrast passage into the jejunum. 
Case courtesy Michael Callahan, MD and Carlo Buonomo, MD, Boston Children’s Hospital. 
• 
During embryogenesis, the duodenum forms as a solid tube. Lack of recanalization causes the spectrum of diseases ranging from duodenal atresia (complete lack of recanalization) to duodenal stenosis (partial recanalization). 

• 
A less severe variant, the duodenal web, allows liquids to pass, but causes the windsock deformity after the child begins to eat solid foods, which get stuck in the web. 

• 
About 80% of cases occur just distal to the ampulla, therefore patients typically present with bilious emesis. 

• 
Even a complete atresia does not preclude distal bowel gas. In the presence of a rare congenital bifid common bile duct, bowel gas can travel through the ampulla of Vater and enter the distal bowel. 

• 
Duodenal anomalies are associated with other abnormalities in 50% of cases, most 


commonly Down syndrome (30% of cases). Other associated anomalies include: VACTERL. Cardiac shunt vascularity (ASD, VSD, PDA, and endocardial cushion defect). Malrotation. Annular pancreas, seen in 20% of babies with duodenal atresia. 
• 
The classic radiographic appearance of duodenal atresia is the double bubble sign caused by dilation of both the stomach and the proximal duodenum, without distal bowel gas. A patient with a double bubble and no distal bowel gas can be presumed to have duodenal atresia. 

• 
If distal bowel gas is present with a double bubble sign, the differential diagnosis includes midgut volvulus, annular pancreas (pancreas wraps around the duodenum), and the less severe variants of duodenal atresia including duodenal stenosis and web. 

• 
Unlike duodenal atresia, jejunal atresia is most commonly caused by an in-utero vascular insult. Jejunal atresia is more common than stenosis. 

• 
The triple bubble sign can be seen on radiography as dilated stomach, duodenum, and proximal jejunum. 


Malrotation and midgut volvulus 
• Discussed earlier in the chapter under GI emergencies. 

Congenital low/distal bowel obstruction 
• 
A contrast enema is performed to differentiate surgical causes (distal atresias and Hirschsprung disease) from medical causes (meconium ileus and functional immaturity) of low/distal bowel obstruction. 

• 
When performing a contrast enema, isotonic or mildly hypertonic water-soluble contrast is used, such as a 17% solution of iothalamate meglumine (400 mOsm/kg water; Cysto-Conray II, Covidien). High osmolar contrast may cause fluid shifts and resultant destabilization of the patient. 


Differential diagnosis of microcolon 
• Microcolon is a colon of abnormally small caliber (typically <1 cm), secondary to disuse. A relatively distal obstruction is necessary to develop a microcolon, as the succus entericus secreted by the proximal bowel prevents microcolon. The two most common causes of microcolon are meconium ileus and ileal atresia. 

Peritoneal/scrotal calcifications may be seen in association with meconium ileus. In contrast to meconium ileus, small left colon syndrome (also confusingly called meconium plug syndrome; subsequently discussed) does NOT cause a microcolon. 
Jejunal atresia does NOT cause microcolon as there is enough succus entericus produced to nourish the colon. 
Total colonic Hirschsprung is rare. The much more common segmental involvement does not cause microcolon. 

Meconium ileus: Neonatal abdominal radiograph (left image) shows a low/distal small bowel obstruction, with a dilated stomach and numerous dilated loops of bowel extending to the pelvis. Contrast enema (right image) shows a very small caliber colon (microcolon; red arrows), with numerous rounded filling defects in the distal ileum (yellow arrows), representing inspissated meconium. 
Case courtesy Michael Callahan, MD and Carlo Buonomo, MD, Boston Children’s Hospital. 
• 
Meconium ileus causes bowel obstruction from inspissated meconium in the distal ileum and colon. It can be complicated by perforation and resultant meconium peritonitis, which can cause abdominal and/or scrotal calcifications. The abdominal calcifications are frequently trapped between the liver and diaphragm, which is not seen in other causes of diffuse abdominal calcifications. 

• 
Meconium ileus is the earliest manifestation of cystic fibrosis: almost 100% of babies with meconium ileus have cystic fibrosis, while ~10% of babies with cystic fibrosis have meconium ileus. 

• 
The classic radiographic appearance of meconium ileus is a distal obstruction (multiple loops of dilated bowel), with soap-bubble lucencies in the right lower quadrant in the region of the distal ileum. 

• 
Contrast enema shows a microcolon (meconium ileus has the smallest of all microcolons) with a distended ileum containing multiple rounded filling defects representing inspissated meconium. 

• 
Meconium ileus is both diagnosed and treated with therapeutic water-soluble gastrografin enema, which functions to loosen the inspissated meconium. It often takes multiple attempts to fully clean out the meconium, and carefully increasing the contrast osmolality may be helpful. Uncommonly, resistant cases may need to be treated surgically. 


Ileal atresia / colonic atresia 
• 
Atresia of the ileum or colon features a microcolon distal to the atretic segment. 

• 
Colonic atresia is rare. 

• 
Unlike meconium ileus, ileal and colonic atresia demonstrate an abrupt cutoff at the site of atresia, and there are no filling defects within the bowel. 



Small left colon: Babygram (left image) shows numerous loops of dilated bowel, suggestive of a distal obstructive pattern. Contrast enema (right image) shows a moderately reduced caliber of the left colon, with an abrupt transition (arrow) at the splenic flexure. The rectum is normal in caliber. 
Case courtesy Michael Hanley, MD, University of Virginia Health System. 
• 
Small left colon, also known as functional immaturity of the colon or meconium plug syndrome, is the most common diagnosis in neonates who fail to pass meconium. It is caused by temporary functional immaturity of the colonic ganglion cells, which causes the distal colon to have abnormal motility right after birth. 

• 
Small left colon is seen more commonly in pre-term neonates or in neonates born to mothers with diabetes or who received magnesium for (pre)eclampsia. Infants with small left colon are almost always otherwise normal. 

• 
In contrast to meconium ileus, small left colon is not a cause of microcolon. Small left colon is not associated with cystic fibrosis/meconium ileus despite the confusing name of “meconium plug syndrome.” 

• 
The imaging appearance on an abdominal radiograph is of distal obstructive pattern. 

• 
Contrast enema shows a small left colon, typically with an abrupt transition in caliber at the splenic flexure. There may be filling defects within the small left colon representing meconium plugs. 

• 
Similar to meconium ileus, water soluble enema is diagnostic and therapeutic, and small left colon resolves with conservative therapy. 

• 
The primary differential consideration is Hirschsprung disease with a transition at the splenic flexure. In contrast to small left colon, Hirschsprung disease would not feature a distensible normal caliber rectum and would not resolve after an enema treatment. 



Hirschsprung disease: Frontal (left image) and lateral (right image) spot radiographs from a contrast enema show a narrowed rectum, which has a smaller diameter than the sigmoid colon. 
Case courtesy Michael Callahan, MD and Carlo Buonomo, MD, Boston Children’s Hospital. 
• 
Hirschsprung disease is aganglionosis of the distal bowel, resulting in failed relaxation of the involved bowel and subsequent bowel obstruction. It is caused by arrest of the normal craniocaudal (proximal-to-distal) migration of vagal neural crest cells to the distal bowel wall. The anus is therefore always affected, and the involved bowel is continuous as it extends proximally. 

• 
Hirschsprung disease typically presents in newborn males who fail to have a bowel movement after 48–72 hours, and have forceful passage of meconium after rectal exam. 

• 
Hirschsprung disease ranges in severity from isolated internal anal sphincter involvement (ultrashort segment) to involvement of the entire colon (very rare, approximately 1–3% of cases, and typically genetic). 

• 
Up to 1/3 of cases of Hirschsprung develop a form of enterocolitis similar to necrotizing enterocolitis, with toxic megacolon being the fulminant form. It is therefore important to consider Hirschsprung in a neonate with bowel obstruction and colitis. 

• 
Multiple congenital anomalies are associated with Hirschsprung disease. Five percent have trisomy 21, but the association with Down syndrome is less compared to duodenal atresia. 

• 
Radiography of Hirschsprung disease shows distal bowel obstruction pattern. 

• 
Contrast enema typically shows a gradual cone-shaped transition zone at the junction of the spastic, narrowed distal colon and the dilated proximal colon, best seen on the lateral view. 


A sawtooth appearance to the rectum may sometimes be seen, representing irregular contractions in the aganglionic segment. The rectum normally has a larger diameter than the sigmoid. When Hirschsprung involves the rectum, the 
rectum will be in spasm and the sigmoid will be dilated, caused by an abnormal rectosigmoid index (ratio of rectal to sigmoid diameter) less than 1. 
• 
In contrast to functional immaturity of the colon, Hirschsprung disease tends to cause a tapered, rather than an abrupt, transition zone. 

• 
Definitive diagnosis is with suction biopsy of the bowel wall. Treatment is surgical. 


Megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome 
• 
Megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome is a rare congenital loss of bladder and bowel smooth muscle function causing absent intestinal peristalsis, microcolon, and distended non-obstructed urinary bladder. It is usually fatal. 

• 
Although uncommon, the Ladd bands of malrotation may cause a distal obstruction. 



Childhood bowel obstruction 
• 
The etiologies and imaging of childhood bowel obstruction overlap with those of adults. Adult bowel obstruction is most commonly caused by adhesions and hernia, both of which may also cause obstruction in a child. 

• 
The most common causes of childhood bowel obstruction can be remembered with the mnemonic AAIIMM (appendicitis, adhesions, internal/inguinal hernia, intussusception, Meckels, and malrotation). Most causes of childhood obstruction are treated surgically. 


Appendicitis 
• Appendicitis is one of the more common causes of ileus or partial bowel obstruction in children over the age of 4 years. 
Inguinal hernia 

Inguinal hernia: Frontal radiograph (left image) shows numerous dilated loops of bowel, with the suggestion of increased opacification in the region of the left hemiscrotum (arrows). Transverse ultrasound of the scrotum (top right image) shows numerous loops of bowel in the left hemiscrotum (arrows). A sagittal ultrasound of the left testis (bottom right image) shows that the testis is normal (calipers) but is displaced by the intra-scrotal bowel loops. 
Case courtesy Michael Callahan, MD, Boston Children’s Hospital. 
• 
Indirect inguinal hernias are more common, resulting from a patent processus vaginalis which maintains a peritoneal communication to the scrotum via the inguinal ring. 

• 
Imaging of an inguinal hernia causing obstruction shows bowel in the inguinal canal or scrotum. There is risk of bowel incarceration when irreducible. 

• 
Meckel diverticulum is a remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct, which connects the fetal ileum to the yolk sac via the umbilicus. Incomplete regression of the omphalomesenteric duct leads to a spectrum of anomalies, ranging from an umbilico-ileal fistula (fecal drainage



e
n
from the umbilicus) to a Meckel diverticulum (by far the most common anomaly occurring in approximately 95%). It is located at the antimesenteric aspect of the distal ileum.

• 
In young children, the most common manifestation is gastrointestinal bleeding (if it contains ectopic gastric mucosa). Less commonly, a Meckel may cause intussusception by acting as a lead point or result in diverticulitis mimicking appendicitis. 

• 
In adults, small bowel obstruction is the most common complication of a Meckel diverticulum, followed by Meckel diverticulitis. 




Meckel diverticulitis in an adult: Axial (left image) and coronal (right) noncontrast CT shows a blind-ending, tubular structure (arrows) arising from the mid to distal ileum, with associated mild inflammatory change. 
Case courtesy Michael Hanley, MD, University of Virginia Health System. 
• 
Although there are often exceptions, the “rule of 2s” states that Meckel diverticula are 2 inches long, 2 feet from the ileocecal valve, present in 2% of the population, become symptomatic before age 2, and contain 2 ectopic tissues (gastric and pancreatic). 

• 
A Meckel diverticulum causing rectal bleeding can be diagnosed with a Tc-99m-pertechnetate scan, which is only positive if the Meckel contains ectopic gastric mucosa. 


Approximately 25% of Meckel contain ectopic gastric (less commonly pancreatic mucosa). On pertechnetate scan, uptake kinetics of the ectopic mucosa is equal to gastric mucosa. 
Crohn disease 
• Crohn disease may be a cause of bowel obstruction. Up to 30% of newly diagnosed Crohn disease presents in the pediatric population. 


Anorectal malformations 
Imperforate anus 
• 
Imperforate anus is a clinical diagnosis, but radiology plays a role to evaluate the level of the obstruction, which is classified as high or low in relation to the puborectalis sling. 

• 
A high lesion (above the puborectalis sling) is associated with genitourinary-rectal fistula, 



lumbosacral anomalies or VACTERL association, and requires a more complex treatment. Males may have a fistula between the rectum and posterior urethra or bladder. Females may have a rectovaginal fistula. In either sex, treatment is initial colostomy followed by definitive repair. Screening ultrasound is needed for evaluation of a tethered cord. 
• 
A low lesion (below the puborectalis sling) is associated with perineal fistula and is treated with single-stage perineal anoplasty. 

• 
The determination of high or low lesion is usually made clinically, based on passage of 


meconium, and is dependent on sex. 
In males, if meconium is passed in the urine . high lesion. 
In females, if meconium is passed in the vagina and a fistula is not visualized . high lesion. Low lesions 
may cause distal vaginal fistulas, which can be visualized by physical exam. 
• Previously, prone-radiographs were used to determine if a lesion was high or low; however, infracoccygeal ultrasound is thought to be the most accurate method to determine the level of the imperforate anus. 


Neonatal cholestatic jaundice 
Approach to pathologic neonatal jaundice 
• 
In contrast to the unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia of the benign and self-limited physiologic jaundice of the newborn, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is never normal and is due to hepatic or biliary dysfunction. 

• 
There are innumerable causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, including biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome, bile acid synthetic defects, metabolic disease, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, and infectious etiologies. 


Alagille syndrome features hereditary cholestasis from paucity of intrahepatic bile ducts, and peripheral pulmonary stenosis. 
• The goal of imaging is to differentiate between biliary atresia (approximately 25% of neonatal conjugated hyperbilirubinemia) and “neonatal hepatitis,” which is a wastebasket diagnosis for all other causes combined. Tc-99m-HIDA hepatobiliary scintigraphy is the test of choice to distinguish between these two entities. 
Patients may be premedicated with 5 days of phenobarbital to stimulate hepatocyte activity prior to hepatobiliary scintigraphy, although this varies by institution. The HIDA agent is actively transported into the hepatocyte and excreted (not conjugated) into the bile. 
• Biliary atresia requires prompt repair to prevent irreversible liver damage. The treatment of neonatal hepatitis is nonsurgical. 
Neonatal hepatitis 

Neonatal hepatitis: 60-minute delay HIDA (left image) shows uptake in the liver but with a large amount of blood pool activity. There is uptake in the bladder and the diaper, but no bowel uptake. Delayed 24-hour image (middle image) also does not show bowel uptake, but there is abnormal persistent hepatic uptake, which is suggestive of hepatitis. A follow-up exam was performed a few weeks later (right image), which showed normal hepatic uptake and small bowel excretion, confirming resolution of neonatal hepatitis.

• 
Hepatobiliary scintigraphy shows poor hepatic excretion, delayed hepatic clearance (beyond 12 hours), and variable bowel excretion. 

• 
Biliary atresia can be effectively ruled out if there is any excretion into the GI tract. 


Biliary atresia 
• 
Ultrasound may not be able to distinguish between biliary atresia and neonatal hepatitis, though the triangular cord sign representing the obliterated common hepatic duct can be seen in the region of the porta hepatis. An absent or atretic gallbladder on ultrasound is suggestive of biliary atresia, but a gallbladder is seen in 20% of cases.  The main hepatic artery is also often enlarged in the setting biliary atresia, with a HA:PV ratio >0.45 suggestive of biliary atresia. 

• 
Hepatobiliary scintigraphy shows normal hepatic tracer uptake and clearance but no excretion into the small bowel after 24 hours. 

• 
Treatment is the Kasai portoenterostomy, a palliative procedure ideally performed before 3 months of age. The entire extrahepatic biliary tree is excised and a jejunal Roux loop is anastomosed to the cut surface of the liver capsule. 80% of children with a successful surgery survive 10 years, at which point a liver transplant is necessary. 

• 
Biliary atresia is associated with polysplenia and trisomy 18. 




Pediatric hepatobiliary neoplasia and masses 
• 
Primary pediatric liver tumors may be classified as epithelial (hepatocyte-derived) or mesenchymal, with benign and malignant tumors in each category. Liver metastases may be seen in the setting of neuroblastoma, Wilms tumor, sarcoma, and Burkitt lymphoma. 

• 
It is usually possible to narrow the differential based on imaging appearance (cystic or solid), age of the patient, and tumor markers (AFP and endothelial growth factor). 

• 
Benign epithelial lesions also seen in adults, including focal nodular hyperplasia and adenoma, are discussed in the gastrointestinal imaging section. 



Cystic Liver/biliary masses 
Mesenchymal hamartoma 

Mesenchymal hamartoma: Coronal (left image) and sagittal (right image) contrast-enhanced CT shows a massive, heterogeneous mass arising from the right lobe of the liver. The displaced liver parenchyma forms a claw sign around the mass (yellow arrows). There are cystic spaces (red arrows) and portal venous fragments within the mass; however, the mass appears predominantly solid, which may be secondary to numerous tiny cysts below the resolution of CT.

• 
Mesenchymal hamartoma is a benign, multicystic, hamartomatous lesion, which contains malformed bile ducts, portal vein fragments, and often extramedullary hematopoiesis. It is considered a developmental anomaly rather than a neoplasm. 

• 
Most children present in the neonatal period with an enlarging abdominal mass, with 80% diagnosed by two years of age. 

• 
In contrast to hepatoblastoma, tumor markers are not elevated. 

• 
Imaging of mesenchymal hamartoma typically shows a large, multicystic, abdominal mass. The cysts can be of various sizes, can contain debris, and can be divided by septae of variable thickness. Hemorrhage and calcification are rare. Occasionally, the cysts may be so small that the mass appears solid. When large, the mass may displace vasculature. 

• 
Surgical resection is almost always curative. 

• 
Choledochal cysts (including Caroli disease) represent saccular or fusiform dilation of bile ducts, which may be segmental or diffuse. The Todani classification of choledochal cysts is discussed further in the gastrointestinal imaging section. 


Gallbladder hydrops 
• Gallbladder hydrops is a pathologically distended gallbladder, usually associated with infection or a systemic inflammatory process such as Kawasaki disease. 

Solid liver/biliary masses 
• Pediatric liver lesions can be categorized by age groups, with children aged 0–3 years presenting with hemangioendothelioma, hepatoblastoma or mesenchymal hamartoma; children over age 5 with HCC and undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma. Metastatic liver tumors, most commonly from Wilms tumor or neuroblastoma, can present at any age. 
Terminology of “hemangioma” in pediatric radiology 

• 
Pediatric vascular anomalies can be divided into vascular neoplasms and vascular malformations, where neoplasms feature new cell growth and malformations feature disorganized vasculature without cell growth. 

• 
Pediatric vascular anomalies can also be classified physiologically as high-flow or low-flow lesions. High-flow vascular malformations include arteriovenous malformations (AVM) and arteriovenous fistulas (AVF), while low-flow vascular malformations include venous malformations and lymphatic malformations. 

• 
The term “hemangioma” is a common source of confusion. In particular, the term “hepatic hemangioma” is often used to describe multiple unrelated vascular lesions including infantile hemangioma, potentially malignant hemangioendotheliomas, and benign venous malformations. 

• 
The common adult hepatic “hemangioma” is actually a venous malformation in the classification above. Similarly, the soft tissue “hemangiomas” of Maffucci syndrome are also venous malformations. 

• 
Infantile hemangioma and hemangioendothelioma, discussed on the next page, are high-flow vascular neoplasms. Hemangioendotheliomas have the potential to metastasize. 



Grayscale (left image) and power Doppler (right image) ultrasound images of the liver show a highly vascular mass in the right hepatic lobe (arrows), containing numerous dilated vascular spaces. 




Infantile hemangioma. Case courtesy Michael Hanley, MD, University of Virginia Health System. 
• Infantile hemangioma and hemangioendothelioma are related vascular neoplasms. They are the most common vascular hepatic tumors, often in children under age 1 year and may cause congestive heart failure in up to 25%. AFP is not elevated; endothelial growth factor is elevated. 
Infantile hemangioma is benign. While hemangioendothelioma is usually benign, it has the potential to 
metastasize. This text will use the term “infantile hemangioma” to include both of these entities. Infantile hemangioma is associated with Kasabach-Merrit syndrome, which is a syndrome of vascular neoplasm, hemolytic anemia, and consumptive coagulopathy. 
• Infantile hemangioma may be focal, multifocal, or diffuse. Lesions are highly vascular, T2 hyperintense, and tend to peripherally enhance with delayed fill-in. There may be calcification, central necrosis, and hemorrhage. 
Angiography (which can be performed prior to embolization) classically shows an enlarged celiac artery, with a decreased caliber of the aorta distal to the celiac axis. 
• Similar to cutaneous infantile hemangiomas, most hepatic infantile hemangiomas will spontaneously involute in the first year of life, especially if GLUT-1 positive. The beta-blocker propranolol may accelerate involution. Surgery may be necessary for lesions causing CHF. 

Hepatoblastoma: Contrast-enhanced axial CT shows a heterogeneous mass with mixed areas of enhancement and necrosis completely replacing the liver parenchyma. There is a hypoattenuating lesion expanding the IVC (arrow), representing tumor thrombus. 
• Hepatoblastoma is a malignant embryonal neoplasm that is the most common primary liver tumor of early childhood (usually under age of 5 years), and the third most common childhood abdominal malignancy overall (after neuroblastoma and Wilms tumor). 
Hepatoblastoma occurs in children slightly older than those affected by infantile hemangioma and mesenchymal hamartoma. Less than 10% of cases occur during the neonatal period. 
• Hepatoblastoma is associated with several genetic anomalies and syndromes, including: 
Beckwith-Wiedemann (q6 month screening ultrasound is performed in these patients). Familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome. Fetal alcohol syndrome. Wilms tumor. 
• 
Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) is markedly elevated (often greater than 1000 ng/mL). Precocious puberty may result from elevated bHCG. 

• 
A classic radiographic finding of hepatoblastoma is right upper quadrant calcification. 

• 
Cross-sectional imaging shows a large well-defined lobulated mass that is predominantly solid, heterogeneous and enhancing, with propensity for portal vein and hepatic vein invasion. 


Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
• 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) typically occurs in children over the age of 5, and is the second most common liver malignancy in children. Similar to adults, HCC is usually seen in the background of cirrhosis. AFP is elevated, as in hepatoblastoma. 

• 
Pediatric causes of cirrhosis include alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, glycogen storage disease, tyrosinemia, biliary atresia, Wilson disease and chronic viral hepatitis. 


Fibrolamellar HCC variant is more commonly seen in patients aged 10–35 years without underlying liver disease or elevated AFP. 
• Imaging is similar to adult HCC, appearing as a heterogeneous hepatic mass with early arterial enhancement and rapid washout. Similar to hepatoblastoma, HCC also commonly demonstrates venous invasion. 

Undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma 
• 
Undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma (malignant mesenchymoma) is a highly aggressive neoplasm, occurring in school-aged children 6–10 years old. 

• 
Unlike in hepatoblastoma and HCC, AFP is not elevated. 

• 
Imaging shows ill-defined heterogeneous mass with solid and cystic components reflecting necrosis and hemorrhage. 

• 
Wilms tumor and neuroblastoma are common pediatric tumors with a propensity to metastasize to the liver. 




Miscellaneous 
Spectrum of meconium 
• 
Meconium aspiration causes respiratory distress in term neonates. 

• 
Meconium ileus is the earliest (infantile) manifestation of cystic fibrosis and only occurs in patients with cystic fibrosis. It causes a microcolon. 

• 
Meconium plug syndrome (small left colon) is a self-limited cause of distal neonatal bowel obstruction. Unlike meconium ileus, meconium plug syndrome is not associated with cystic fibrosis, and is not a cause of microcolon. 

• 
Meconium ileus-equivalent syndrome, or distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) can be the presenting symptom of previously undiagnosed cystic fibrosis, typically in an adolescent or young adult. Patients clinically present with recurrent abdominal pain and chronic constipation due to abnormally viscous stool in the ileum and right colon. 

• 
Meconium peritonitis is caused by in-utero small bowel perforation and meconium spillage, resulting in peritonitis, secondary calcification, and meconium pseudocyst formation. 



Meconium peritonitis: Frontal radiograph shows diffuse coarse calcifications abutting the peritoneal surface (arrows) in the right and left upper quadrants.

Abdominal calcification 
• Abdominal calcification seen on radiography can be an important clue to the presence of underlying pathology, including: 
Meconium peritonitis. 
Several pediatric neoplasms may contain calcifications, including neuroblastoma, teratoma, and hepatoblastoma. Adrenal hemorrhage may cause calcification of the adrenal glands. Right upper quadrant calcifications can be seen with gallstones, hepatoblastoma, and hepatic TORCH 
infections (e.g., CMV and toxoplasmosis).
