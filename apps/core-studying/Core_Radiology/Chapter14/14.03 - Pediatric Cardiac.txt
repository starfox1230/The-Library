Pediatric Cardiac 
Approach to the plain film of congenital heart disease 
Plain film evaluation of congenital heart disease: Of historical interest only? 
• 
Most congenital heart disease is diagnosed in utero during routine fetal ultrasound. 

• 
If a newborn has unexpected shortness of breath with clinical concern for a cardiac cause, an echocardiogram is typically the imaging study of choice. Advanced imaging, such as CTA or MRI, may also be helpful in certain clinical situations. 

• 
Even though the specific diagnosis of congenital heart disease may not be determined from the plain radiograph, there is value in describing the radiographic findings (e.g., increased pulmonary vascularity, cardiomegaly, etc.). 


Plain film evaluation of congenital heart disease: Three questions to ask 
• 
First, is the patient cyanotic or acyanotic? 

• 
Second, is the pulmonary vascularity increased or decreased? This can be either increased venous flow, increased arterial flow, or decreased arterial flow. Increased vascularity can be determined by examining the peripheral 1/3 of the lungs where there is 


normally very little blood flow. Increased peripheral vasculature suggests either increased pulmonary venous or pulmonary arterial flow. 
1) Increased pulmonary venous flow (pulmonary edema) is seen when the left ventricular outflow tract can’t keep up with venous return. 
Causes include left heart insufficiency, obstructive left heart lesion, or congestive heart failure. Peripheral 1/3 of the lungs shows indistinct vessels and septal markings. 
2) Increased pulmonary arterial flow (shunt vascularity) tends to present in childhood rather than infancy. It is caused by a left-to-right shunt, which leads to the right side of the heart pumping too much blood to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries. 
Peripheral 1/3 of the lungs shows distinct, large-caliber vessels. 
3) Decreased pulmonary arterial flow is due to right ventricular outflow tract insufficiency. 
Any lesion causing decreased pulmonary arterial flow is ALWAYS cyanotic because not enough blood is being oxygenated in the lungs. Peripheral 1/3 of the lungs shows decreased vasculature. 
• 
Third, is the heart enlarged or normal in size? Note, it is never smaller than normal (even in hypoplastic left heart syndrome). 

• 
Additional findings, such as specific contour to the aorta and cardiac chambers, orientation of the aortic arch, and side of stomach bubble can help refine the diagnosis. 


Plain film evaluation of congenital heart disease: Can it be anything else? 
• It is important to remember that an apparently enlarged heart and abnormal pulmonary vasculature can be due to other diseases in addition to congenital heart disease, including: 
Intracardiac tumor, such as a rhabdomyoma. CHF due to a peripheral shunt (e.g., vein of Galen malformation or hepatic hemangioendothelioma). Mediastinal mass. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia with non-aerated bowel. 
Bronchiolitis may also mimic pulmonary edema, particularly in children with congenital heart disease. 

Overview of radiographic differential diagnosis for congenital heart disease 
Acyanotic congenital heart disease 
• Neonatal increased pulmonary venous flow (pulmonary edema) may be caused by: 
Hypoplastic left heart, similar in physiology to CHF (left ventricle cannot keep up with venous return). Aortic coarctation, which is a left ventricular outflow tract lesion. Congestive heart failure (CHF), which may be due to a primary cardiac anomaly or an extra-cardiac 
arteriovenous shunt, such as a vein of Galen malformation or hepatic hemangioendothelioma. Neonatal sepsis, typically seen in the setting of neonatal pneumonia. 
• Increased pulmonary arterial flow (shunt vascularity) tends to present in childhood rather than the neonatal period, and can be caused by: 
Atrial septal defect (ASD). Ventricular septal defect (VSD). Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Endocardial cushion defect (ECD), also known as an atrioventricular (AV) septal or AV canal defect, has a 
strong association with Down syndrome. 
Cyanotic congenital heart disease 
• Decreased pulmonary vascularity with cardiomegaly: 
Ebstein anomaly. Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum. 
Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). 
Tricuspid atresia (variable pulmonary vascularity, see below). 
• 
Decreased pulmonary vascularity without cardiomegaly: 

• 
Usually increased pulmonary vascularity without cardiomegaly (but variable): “T” lesions (excluding Tetralogy of Fallot): 



Transposition of the great arteries (D-transposition). 
Truncus arteriosus. Tricuspid atresia. 

Total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR). 
Single (“Tingle” to keep the T-theme consistent) ventricle, and variants including double outlet left ventricle and double outlet right ventricle. 


Normal anatomy 

Ao = aorta PA = pulmonary artery RA = right atrium 
mitral valve aortic valve 
LA = left atrium RV = right ventricle LV = left ventricle 
tricuspid valve 

Acyanotic: Increased pulmonary venous flow (pulmonary edema) 
Hypoplastic left heart (HLH) 
• 
Hypoplastic left heart (HLH) syndrome represents a hypoplastic spectrum of congenital heart aorta anomalies characterized by underdevelopment of any part of the left heart including left atrium, mitral valve, left ventricle, aortic valve, or aorta. 

• 
Survival is dependent on a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) with resultant right to left shunting to supply the systemic circulation. 

• 
The neonatal chest radiograph in HLH is usually normal, but HLH is classified as a “pulmonary edema” entity. Immediately after birth, the ductus arteriosus remains patent and pulmonary arterial resistance remains high, so blood continues to flow from the pulmonary artery to the aorta (systemic circulation) via the PDA. After a few days, however, the ductus begins to close and pulmonary arterial resistance falls, leading 


to increase in pulmonary blood flow and delayed blood clearance from the lungs. Cardiogenic shock can ensue without operative management. Note that despite the left heart hypoplasia, the heart does not appear small on imaging. 
• The surgical treatment of hypoplastic left heart is performed in three sequential stages, starting with the Norwood procedure. This is described in detail later in the chapter. 
Extracardiac shunt causing CHF 
• The two most common lesions to cause neonatal CHF are vein of Galen malformation and hepatic hemangioendothelioma. 
Aortic coarctation 
• 
Aortic coarctation is congenital focal narrowing of the aorta in the region of the ductus arteriosus. It may be preductal (proximal to the ductus, illustrated on the right), periductal, or postductal. 

• 
The preductal form may cause congestive heart failure (CHF) in infants due to left ventricular obstruction, leading to cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary venous flow. In contrast, the juxtaductal or postductal variants present later in life in the teenage or early adult years as upper extremity hypertension. 

• 
Aortic coarctation is associated with bicuspid aortic valve, which may become stenotic and cause post-stenotic aortic dilation proximal to the site of coarctation. Other associations include Turner syndrome (XO), Shone syndrome and intracerebral berry aneurysms. 

• 
In infants, aortic coarctation may produce acyanotic CHF. In adults, the classic radiographic finding is the 3 sign representing the contour of the coarcted aorta in the left upper mediastinum. Although rib notching is described as a classic finding, it is rarely seen. 





Acyanotic: Increased pulmonary arterial flow (shunt vascularity) 
• It is rare for shunt lesions to present in the neonatal period because pulmonary vascular resistance is high, which limits left-to-right shunting. In long-standing shunting, progressive volume overload causes the typical “shunt vascularity” (very prominent distinct pulmonary arteries without the haziness of pulmonary edema) and cardiomegaly. 
Atrial septal defect (ASD) 
sinus venosus ASD (SVC-type) 
sinus venosus ASD (IVC-type) 
coronary sinus ASD 

• 
Although atrial septal defect (ASD) is a common intracardiac left-to-right shunt, it is rarely diagnosed in infants or young children. ASD usually presents in later childhood or early adulthood, twice as commonly in females. Although most are an isolated abnormality, ASD may rarely be associated with syndromes, such as Holt-Oram (ASD and upper extremity bone deformities, including absence or hypoplasia of the thumb). 

• 
Ostium secundum ASD is the most common type of ASD (60% of cases), caused by incomplete covering of the ostium secundum by the septum secundum. 


This is usually an isolated anomaly, located in the region of the fossa ovalis. Ostium secundum ASD may close without treatment, in contrast to the other ASD types. Ostium secundum ASD is associated with Ebstein anomaly. 
• Ostium primum ASD is the second most common type of ASD (30% of cases), caused by incomplete fusion of the septum primum to the endocardial cushion. 
The location is low in the atrial septum, contiguous with the AV valves and is often seen with a complete AV canal defect. Ostium primum is associated with Down syndrome. 
• Sinus venosus ASD is rare (5% of cases), located either near the SVC or IVC adjacent to a defect in the posterior wall of the right atrium. 
There is a strong association with partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (PAPVR), particularly of the right upper lobe. 
• Coronary sinus ASD is the rarest type (<1%). It is also termed “unroofed” coronary sinus and is characterized by a partially or completely absent wall between the coronary sinus and left atrium. 
It is associated with a persistent left-sided SVC. 
• An ASD causes right heart volume overload. The left atrium is usually normal because blood is decompressed from the left atrium to the right atrium during both systole and diastole. However, if mitral regurgitation is present, secondary left atrial enlargement may result. 

Atrial septal defect (ASD; continued) 
• 
Initially, the right atrium enlarges, followed by right ventricular enlargement (which may be visible on the lateral radiograph as an opacity in the retrosternal clear space). In late-stage disease, the pulmonary artery also becomes enlarged. 

• 
Shunt vascularity is usually present on radiography by the time the lesion is symptomatic. 

• 
Treatment is ASD closure, typically with an Amplatzer or similar device. 


Ventricular septal defect (VSD) 
• 
Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is typically diagnosed earlier than ASD, with many children presenting after the first month of life as pulmonary vascular resistance falls. A VSD may occur in the membranous (70%) or muscular interventricular septum. 

• 
VSD primarily causes dilation of the left heart. Left-to-right shunting occurs in systole, causing volume overload of the left heart and resulting in left atrial and left ventricular dilation. 

• 
Imaging findings are variable, depending on the size of the VSD. The classic imaging findings of shunt vascularity and cardiomegaly typically take a few years to develop, although there may be mild cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular flow shortly after birth. The left atrium is often enlarged, which may splay the mainstem bronchi at the carina. 

• 
If unrepaired, Eisenmenger syndrome may develop, which represents pulmonary hypertension and reversal of the shunt direction. Eisenmenger syndrome is rare as most patients undergo surgery before pulmonary flow reversal occurs. 


Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) 
• The ductus arteriosus is a normal vascular 


structure of the fetal circulation that connects the proximal left pulmonary artery to the descending aorta. The ductus normally functionally closes by 48 hours of life and anatomically closes by 1–3 months. 
• 
A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) results in a persistent left-to-right shunt. PDA is associated with maternal rubella and pre­term infants, thought to be due to elevated fetal prostaglandins, which inhibit closure of the ductus. 

• 
A small PDA is usually asymptomatic. A large PDA may produce a characteristic machine-like murmur and cause CHF in infancy. 

• 
The classic clinical presentation of PDA is a premature infant who develops radiographic evidence of CHF at 7–10 days of life, as pulmonary vascular resistance begins to fall. 

• 
Treatment of PDA is medical (indomethacin, a prostaglandin inhibitor) or surgical (clip placement). Eisenmenger syndrome may develop if untreated. 


Atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) / Common atrioventricular canal / Endocardial cushion defect (ECD)

• 
Atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), also known as common AV canal or endocardial cushion defect (ECD), encompasses a spectrum of partial to complete defects involving ostium primum ASD, VSD, and mitral or tricuspid anomalies. AVSD is strongly associated with trisomy 21. 

• 
The primitive endocardial cushion is responsible for the formation of several structures in 


fetal development, including: Posterior and membranous ventricular septum. Anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. Responsible for closure of the ostium primum. 

Cyanotic: Decreased pulmonary vascularity with cardiomegaly 
Ebstein anomaly 
• 
Ebstein anomaly is a severe malformation of the tricuspid valve characterized by apical displacement of the septal and posteroinferior leaflets, resulting in obstruction of the pulmonic valve and right ventricular outflow tract. These changes lead to morphologic “atrialization” of the RV. 

• 
An ASD is always present. 

• 
Imaging classically shows a huge box-shaped heart, with massive right atrial enlargement and decreased pulmonary vascularity. 




Ebstein anomaly: Frontal chest radiograph in a neonate shows massive cardiomegaly. Although the enlarged heart obscures most of the lungs, there are hardly any vascular markings in the visualized periphery. 
An endotracheal tube and umbilical artery catheter are in place. 
Of note, pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum would appear identical. 
Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum 
• Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum appears identical to Ebstein anomaly on radiography, with massive right atrial enlargement and decreased pulmonary blood flow. Because the lack of VSD markedly reduces blood flow to the lungs, pulmonary blood flow depends on a left-to-right shunt, such as a patent ductus. 
RA 
• Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum is completely different from pulmonary atresia with a VSD, which is in the spectrum of tetralogy of Fallot and most commonly has a normal-sized heart.

Cyanotic: Decreased pulmonary vascularity without cardiomegaly 
Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) 
• 
Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cyanotic heart disease of children and adults 

• 
The 4 components of TOF are: 


1. RV outflow tract obstruction. 
aorta overrides 
2. RV hypertrophy. 
VSD 

3.
 VSD. 

4.
 Aorta “over-riding” the VSD. 


pulmonic
A variation of TOF is the pentalogy of 
stenosis 
Fallot, which also has an ASD. Pulmonary atresia with a VSD is a severe form of TOF. 
• 
The degree of cyanosis depends on the degree of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. 

• 
TOF is associated with DiGeorge syndrome (absent thymus and parathyroids, causing hypocalcemia), VACTERL, and trisomy 21. 25% of cases of TOF have a right-sided aortic arch. 

• 
Classic radiographic findings of TOF are a boot-shaped heart (cardiac apex uplifted by RV hypertrophy, although the heart is normal in size) and decreased pulmonary vascularity. 

• 
Surgical repair involves closure of VSD and opening of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, which is usually performed in infancy. 



Tetralogy of Fallot: Portable chest radiograph in a neonate demonstrates a normal-sized heart with an upturned cardiac apex (boot-shaped heart). The lungs are hyperinflated with prominent coarse interstitium. 

Cyanotic: Increased pulmonary vascularity (admixture “T” lesions) 
 Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) 

Transposition of the great arteries: 
Antenatal ultrasound at an oblique plane through the great vessels demonstrates the aorta (Ao) is anterior to the pulmonary artery (PA), as the aorta arises from the right ventricle (the most anterior cardiac chamber). 
Case courtesy Beryl Benacerraf, MD, 
Diagnostic Ultrasound Associates, Boston. 
• 
Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is the most common cause of cyanotic heart disease in newborns. In TGA, there is improper pairing of the ventricles and great vessels (ventriculoarterial discordance): the morphologic right ventricle pumps blood to the aorta and the morphologic left ventricle pumps blood to the pulmonary arteries. 

• 
Two main subtypes of TGA exist: Dextro (D)-TGA features ventriculoarterial discordance with atrioventricular concordance (correctly paired 


atria and ventricles). Isolated D-TGA without flow admixture (ASD, VSD or PDA) is incompatible with life (“D = death”). Levo (L)-TGA features a “congenitally corrected TGA” with atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial (double) 
discordance. L-TGA is compatible with life (“L = life”). 
• 
Pre-natal ultrasound diagnosis of TGA requires evaluation of the short- or long-axis of the great vessels. TGA is usually inapparent on a 4-chamber view. Sonographic diagnosis shows the aorta anterior the heart and the great vessels exiting the heart in parallel (rather than crossing in the normal fashion). 

• 
The classic radiographic egg-on-a-string appearance (D-TGA) is actually uncommonly seen. It represents a narrow mediastinal waist (caused by the parallel course of the aorta and PA and thymic involution secondary to stress). A more typical appearance is a slightly narrow superior mediastinum, lack of main pulmonary artery bulge and increased pulmonary vasculature; however, the radiographic picture varies depending on the nature of the coexisting shunt. A right aortic arch is seen in 5%. 

• 
Surgical treatment for D-TGA is the arterial switch (Jatene) procedure, which swaps the aorta and pulmonary artery, and relocates the coronary arteries to the neo-aorta. 


Tricuspid atresia 
• Tricuspid atresia is absence or dysplasia of the tricuspid valve resulting in no flow between the right atrium and right ventricle. It may have a variable radiographic appearance depending on the size of the associated VSD. 
Small VSD: Normal-sized heart, with decreased pulmonary vasculature. Large VSD: Enlarged heart with increased pulmonary flow. 
Truncus arteriosus 
• 
In truncus arteriosus, a single great artery arises from the base of the heart to supply the systemic, pulmonary, and coronary circulations. The single great artery usually overrides a VSD. 

• 
Truncus arteriosus is the most common type of congenital heart disease to have a right aortic arch (21–36% of cases). It is also associated with DiGeorge syndrome (30–35% of cases). 

• 
The classic radiograph appearance is cardiomegaly, narrow mediastinum, and pulmonary edema. 



Total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR) 
• 
In total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR), all pulmonary veins connect anomalously to the systemic venous circulation instead of draining into the left atrium. 

• 
There is an obligate interatrial right-to-left communication enabling blood to reach the left heart, such as a large PFO or an ASD. 

• 
Classification of TAPVR is based on the position of the venous drainage relative to the heart: 



Supracardiac (40%): Anomalous venous return is at or above the level of the SVC. The common confluence of the pulmonary veins drains into the left inominate vein via a vertical vein. Chest radiograph chows the characteristic snowman sign, with the dilated vertical vein making up the left border of the snowman. The snowman sign is seen in older patients without pulmonary venous obstruction. 
Cardiac (20%): Anomalous drainage is into the coronary sinus or right atrium. 
Infracardiac (35%): The anomalous drainage passes through the diaphragm via the esophageal hiatus and then drains into the hepatic IVC, hepatic vein, or portal vein. Pulmonary edema can result due to obstruction at the level of the diaphragm. 
Mixed (<5%): Anomalous venous drainage is a combination of the above types. 
• Clinical and radiographic findings depend on the degree of pulmonary venous obstruction and admixture. A typical radiographic appearance of obstructed TAPVR appearance is a normal-sized heart and pulmonary edema in an infant. 
Single (“tingle”) ventricle 
• 
There are multiple variations of the single ventricle anomaly, which are all characterized by arterio-venous admixture at the level of a shared monoventricle. 

• 
Double outlet right ventricle (DORV) can be considered a form of single ventricle.

Common surgeries for congenital heart disease 
Hypoplastic left heart surgery 
• The surgical treatment of hypoplastic left heart is performed in three sequential stages. The goal is to create an effective single ventricle heart (using the right ventricle) to pump blood to the entire body. 
A staged repair is necessary since the high pulmonary vascular resistance in the neonatal period precludes immediate definitive repair. 
hypoplastic left heart syndrome Norwood procedure 

modiÿed Blalock-Taussig shunt (subclavian artery to PA) 
PDA closure 
reconstructed neoaorta using native pulmonary artery 
atrial septectomy 
• Stage 1: The first stage is the Norwood procedure, performed within the first few days of life and has three main components. First, the right ventricle is redirected to supply the systemic circulation by reconstructing the aorta using the main pulmonary artery (PA). Second, the atrial septum is excised, and the PDA is ligated, to redirect pulmonary venous return to the right heart via the atrial septal defect. Third, pulmonary arterial circulation is provided via a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (BT shunt), which connects the right subclavian artery to the right pulmonary artery via a prosthetic graft. BT shunt is associated with a coronary steal phenomenon. This occurs when diastolic blood flow is diverted from the aorta to the low-pressure pulmonary vasculature via the shunt, resulting in reduced flow to the coronary arteries. 
An alternative to BT shunt is the Sano shunt, which is an extracardiac conduit that connects the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery. It does not cause coronary steal. 
Sano shunt (RV to RA conduit) 
BT shunt and Sano shunt are also used as palliative treatment for pulmonary arterial flow obstruction, such as in TOF, pulmonary atresia, and tricuspid atresia. 
Hypoplastic left heart surgery (continued) 

bidrectional Glenn 

Blalock-Taussig shunt is removed 
SVC attached to right PA 
• Stage 2: The BTS is replaced with a bidirectional Glenn (BDG) shunt, where the SVC is connected to the right pulmonary artery. This is performed once pulmonary arterial resistance has fallen to normal levels, about 3–6 months after stage 1. The goal is to begin to separate systemic and pulmonary circulations. 
The Glenn shunt is associated with acquired pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Etiology is unclear but thought to be related to lack of hepatic venous flow to the lungs following the procedure. Literature has shown regression of pulmonary AVMs following restoration of hepatic venous flow to the lungs, for example after Fontan revision (below). 

modiÿed Fontan 

bidirectional Glenn remains 
conduit connecting IVC and right PA 
fenestration between conduit and RA 
• Stage 3: A modified Fontan is performed once the patient cannot supply adequate oxygenated blood to the systemic circulation, usually between 17 months to 4 years of age. In this procedure, a tunneled conduit connects the IVC to the right pulmonary artery. The SVC continues to empty into the right pulmonary artery via the BDG constructed in stage 2. 
Surgical treatments for D-transposition of the great arteries 
• 
As described earlier, D-TGA is a cyanotic congenital heart disease incompatible with life unless mixture of the systemic and pulmonary venous return exists. 

• 
The Mustard and Senning procedures are early surgical approaches for D-TGA repair. Both involve creation of a baffle or conduit to correct blood flow at the atrial level, redirecting systemic venous return to the morphologic LV and pulmonary artery, and pulmonary venous flow to the morphologic RV and aorta. However, these procedures have fallen out of favor due to complications associated with the intra-artial baffle and RV failure. 

• 
The arterial switch or Jatene procedure is a newer and now preferred surgical technique for anatomic repair of D-TGA. The ascending aorta and pulmonary artery are detached and switched. The coronary arteries are reimplanted onto the neoaorta. 


The LeCompte maneuver is a modified step of the Jatene procedure which involves moving the pulmonary artery anterior to the aorta, resulting in the classic imaging appearance of main pulmonary trunk “straddling” the aorta. 

Dextro-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA) after arterial switch: Axial CT angiogram shows anterior position of the left and right pulmonary arteries (LPA, RPA) draping over the ascending aorta (AAo). 
Rastelli procedure 
• 
The Rastelli procedure was initially designed to treat D-TGA associated with VSD and left ventricular outflow (LVOT) obstruction. It can also be used for repair of pulmonary atresia with VSD, or double outlet RV with pulmonary stenosis or atresia. 

• 
This surgical approach involves creation of an intraventricular baffle that connects the LV to the aorta and closes the VSD, and an extra-cardiac conduit that connects the RV to the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary valve is then surgically closed. 




Visceroatrial situs 
• 
Visceroatrial situs describes the relationship between the thoracoabdominal viscera and atria. 

• 
Attention to the position of the liver, spleen and stomach is helpful in determining situs. 


Situs solitus 
• Situs solitus refers to the normal conventional anatomy, with the right atrium and liver on the right; and left atrium, spleen and stomach on the left. The right lung is trilobed and left lung is bilobed. 

Situs Inversus 
• Situs inversus represents the opposite of situs solitus, with the left atrium, spleen and stomach on the right; and the right atrium and liver on the left. There is an association with primary ciliary dyskinesia. 
Situs ambiguous / heterotaxy 


Axial (left image) and coronal (right image) contrast-enhanced CT demonstrates findings of left isomerism including a left-sided liver, a right-sided stomach (yellow arrow), multiple splenules (red arrows) in the right upper quadrant, and azygous continuation of the IVC (blue arrow). 
• 
Situs ambiguous features neither situs solitus or inversus, and has two general subsets. 

• 
Right-isomerism (asplenia) features bilateral right-sidedness, including a horizontal liver, absent spleen and bilateral trilobed lungs. It is associated with severe congenital heart disease such as TAPVR. 

• 
Left-isomerism (polysplenia) features bilateral left-sidedness, including multiple splenules, interruption of the IVC with azygous or hemiazygous continuation. It is associated with biliary atresia and less severe congenital heart disease (ASD or VSD). 




Cardiac masses 
Rhabdomyoma 
• 
Rhabdomyoma is the most common primary cardiac tumor in infants and children. It is strongly associated with tuberous sclerosis and is the earliest sign of tuberous sclerosis that can be diagnosed in utero. Rhabdomyomas are often multiple. 

• 
Rhabdomyoma has a varied clinical presentation, including arrhythmia and outflow obstruction depending on location of the tumor. It is usually found in the ventricles. 

• 
The most common radiographic appearance of rhabdomyoma is cardiomegaly. Pulmonary vasculature is variable. 

• 
On MRI, rhabdomyomas are T1 isointense to hyperintense, T2 hyperintense, and hypoenhancing relative to myocardium. 

• 
Typical clinical course is spontaneous regression in childhood. Therefore, rhabdomyomas in asymptomatic patients are treated conservatively. 


Fibroma 

Cardiac fibroma: Coronal (left image) and axial (right image) CT angiogram demonstrates a large well-circumscribed mass arising from the anterior lateral left ventricular myocardium, which is hypoenhancing relative to adjacent normal myocardium and with central coarse calcification. 
• 
Fibroma is a rare benign cardiac tumor of infancy and early childhood, arising from fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. 

• 
Fibroma has a similar clinical presentation to rhabdomyoma, with rhythm disturbances and outflow obstruction. The interventricular septum is the most common site of origin, where a fibroma is especially likely to cause arrhythmia due to disruption of the conduction system. 

• 
Cardiomegaly is the most common radiographic finding. 

• 
Central calcification on CT is a pathognomonic finding of fibromas, which differentiates them from rhabdomyomas. 

• 
MRI classically shows a well-defined mass that is T1 hypointense to isointense relative to myocardium, T2 hypointense, and demonstrates progressive enhancement with a hypoenhancing core due to poor blood supply. 

• 
Unlike rhabdomyoma, fibroma often present as a single mass and do not involute. Therefore, treatment is typically surgical resection. 


Teratoma 
• 
Teratoma is the second most common cardiac tumor in fetuses and neonates. 

• 
The majority of cardiac teratomas arise in the pericardium. A common location is attached to the root of the pulmonary artery and aorta. Intramyocardial teratoma is rare.  

• 
Teratoma may cause pleural effusion when arising from the pericardium. Pericardial teratoma is one of the primary causes of massive perinatal pericardial effusion, with potential for tamponade. 

• 
Classic imaging appearance is a multilocular cystic and solid mass abutting the pulmonary artery and aorta. 

• 
On MRI, teratomas are T1 hypointense to isointense relative to myocardium, T2 hyperintense, and hypoenhancing on first-pass myocardial perfusion imaging (which differentiates teratomas from hemangiomas). 

• 
Treatment is surgical excision. 


Hemangioma 
• 
Hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor that can occur in any cardiac chamber. 

• 
Similar to teratoma, neonatal cardiac hemangioma is also associated with massive pericardial effusion. 

• 
On MRI, cardiac hemangiomas are T2 hyperintense and enhance avidly on first-pass myocardial perfusion. 

• 
Treatment is surgical excision.
