Spleen 
Congenital splenic variations and anomalies 
Splenule (accessory spleen) 
•	 
Also called an accessory spleen, a splenule is a focus of normal splenic tissue separate from the main body of the spleen due to embryologic failure of fusion of the splenic anlage. The most common location is the splenic hilum. 

•	 
Although usually an incidental finding, the presence of a splenule does have significance in certain clinical settings. For instance, splenectomy for consumptive thrombocytopenia may not be curative if there is sufficient unresected accessory splenic tissue present. A splenule may be mistaken for a lymph node or mass when in an unusual location. As previously discussed, an intrapancreatic splenule may be mistaken for a hypervascular pancreatic mass. 

•	 
A splenule should follow splenic tissue on all MRI sequences. If in doubt, a Tc-99m sulfur colloid scan or a heat-damaged Tc-99m RBC scan can be confirmatory. 


Polysplenia syndrome 
•	 
Polysplenia syndrome is a spectrum of anatomic disorders characterized by some degree of visceral heterotaxia in addition to multiple discrete foci of splenic tissue. Multiple spleens may be located on the right or left but are always on the same side as the stomach. 

•	 
Polysplenia is usually associated with severe congenital cardiac anomalies. Most patients die in early childhood, but a few may have only minor cardiac defects and polysplenia may be incidentally discovered in adulthood. 

•	 
Polysplenia is associated with venous anomalies including interruption of the IVC with azygos or hemiazygos continuation. A less common association is a preduodenal portal vein. 


Wandering spleen 
•	 
A wandering spleen is a normal spleen with abnormal laxity or absence of its fixed ligamentous attachments. 

•	 
Wandering spleen may present clinically as an abdominal mass or may cause acute abdominal pain secondary to torsion. 



Axial (left image) and coronal (right image) contrast-enhanced CT demonstrates a normal sized spleen (arrows) in the left pelvis, consistent with wandering spleen. There are no findings to suggest torsion. 


Overview of splenic lesions 

Cystic 

PSCS = pleomorphic spindle cell sarcoma (previously malignant ÿbrous histiocytoma or MFH) SANT = sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation IMT = in°ammatory myoÿbroblastic tumor 
EMH = extramedullary hematopoiesis The above are rare splenic neoplasms not covered in this textbook, but included in this list for completion 

Cystic splenic lesions 
•	    Cystic lesions in the spleen are overwhelmingly benign in nature. 
Congenital true (epithelial) cyst 

Splenic epithelial cyst: T2-weighted MRI with fat saturation (left image) and enhanced T1-weighted MRI (right image) shows a large T2 hyperintense, T1 hypointense, non-enhancing structure (arrows) replacing nearly the entire splenic parenchyma.

•	 
A congenital true cyst is defined as having an epithelial lining. Interestingly, a splenic epithelial cyst may cause elevation of tumor markers including CA19-9, CA125, and CEA, despite its completely benign nature. 

•	 
Unlike a post-traumatic pseudocyst, a true cyst may have septations, but mural calcification is uncommon. 


Post-traumatic pseudocyst 
•	 
A post-traumatic pseudocyst is the end result of evolution of a splenic hematoma. 

•	 
Unlike a true (epithelial) splenic cyst, the periphery of a pseudocyst is not cellular but made of fibrotic tissue and septations are uncommon but there may be mural calcifications. 

•	 
On imaging, a post-traumatic pseudocyst appears as a well-circumscribed, fluid-density lesion with no peripheral enhancement. 


Intrasplenic pancreatic pseudocyst 
•	 
A post-pancreatitis pancreatic pseudocyst involving the tail of the pancreas may extend into the spleen. 

•	 
Unlike a true congenital cyst, it lacks an epithelial lining and histology more closely resembles a post-traumatic pseudocyst. 

•	 
Splenic rupture has been reported in some cases of intrasplenic post-pancreatitis pseudocysts. 


Lymphangioma 
•	 
Splenic lymphangioma is a rare, benign neoplasm usually diagnosed in childhood, which may be solitary or multiple. 

•	 
Lymphangioma features a classic imaging appearance of a multilocular cystic structure with thin septations. Post-contrast images may show septal enhancement. 




Benign non-cystic splenic lesions 
•	 If a mass is found in the spleen and the patient has no history of widespread malignancy or symptoms referred to the left upper quadrant, the mass is most likely benign. 
Hemangioma 

Multiple splenic hemangiomas: T2-weighted (left image) and post-contrast T1-weighted (right image) MRI shows multiple T2 hyperintense splenic lesions (arrows) that demonstrate subtle peripheral enhancement. 
•	 
Hemangioma is the most common benign splenic neoplasm. They may be solitary or multiple and they tend to be small. 

•	 
Splenic hemangiomas are associated with Kasabach-Merritt syndrome (anemia, thrombocytopenia, and consumptive coagulopathy) and Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome (cutaneous hemangiomas, varicose veins, and extremity hypertrophy). These visceral hemangiomatosis syndromes are usually associated with phleboliths. 

•	 
On CT, hemangiomas are typically iso- or hypoattenuating pre-contrast and hyperenhancing. On MR, hemangiomas are typically hyperintense on T2-weighted images and may enhance peripherally or homogeneously. However, the classic pattern of discontinuous nodular enhancement seen in hepatic hemangiomas is uncommon. 

•	 
Nuclear medicine scintigraphy with Tc-99m labeled red blood cells would show increased activity within the lesion on delayed images. In contrast, Tc-99m sulfur colloid scanning may show either increased or decreased activity. 


Hamartoma 

Splenic hamartoma: T2-weighted (left image) and arterial-phase enhanced T1-weighted (right image) MRI shows a vague T2 isointense splenic mass (arrows) that enhances heterogeneously. 
•	 
Splenic hamartoma is a rare, benign lesion composed of malformed red pulp elements. It may be associated with tuberous sclerosis. 

•	 
Splenic hamartoma is typically a well-circumscribed, iso- or hypoattenuating mass on unenhanced CT that enhances heterogeneously after contrast administration. 

•	 
On MRI, a hamartoma is iso- to slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted images, featuring heterogeneous early enhancement and relatively homogeneous delayed enhancement.

Inflammatory splenic lesions 
Sarcoidosis 
•	 
Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease of unknown etiology characterized histologically by multiple nodules composed of noncaseating granulomas. 

•	 
When sarcoidosis involves the spleen, splenomegaly is the most common presenting finding, often associated with hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy. 

•	 
Less commonly, sarcoidosis may involve the spleen in a multinodular pattern with numerous 


hypoattenuating 1–3 cm lesions demonstrating essentially no enhancement. These nodules are formed by coalescent sarcoid granulomas and have low signal on all MRI sequences. Sarcoid nodules are most conspicuous on T2-weighted images and early-phase post-contrast T1-weighted 
images. On the post-contrast images, the nonenhancing nodules will stand out against the avidly enhancing splenic parenchyma. 
•	 Imaging appearance is generally indistinguishable from splenic lymphoma. 
Inflammatory pseudotumor 
•	 
Splenic inflammatory pseudotumor is a rare focal collection of immune cells and associated inflammatory exudate of unclear etiology. Patients often have constitutional symptoms including fever and malaise. 

•	 
Inflammatory pseudotumor has a variable and nonspecific imaging appearance, but a typical presentation is of a well-circumscribed, heterogeneously enhancing mass. 




Splenic infection 
Pyogenic abscess 

Axial and coronal contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen demonstrates a heterogeneous gas-containing fluid collection (arrows) within the medial spleen with irregular wall thickening and surrounding perisplenic stranding. This was a case of Staph. aureus pyogenic splenic abscess that was subsequently drained percutaneously. 
•	 
Splenic bacterial abscesses are uncommon and usually seen in immunocompromised patients. A solitary abscess is much more likely to be bacterial. In contrast, multifocal small abscesses are more likely to be fungal. 

•	 
On CT, a bacterial abscess usually has an irregular, enhancing wall. Gas is not usually seen but is highly specific for a bacterial abscess when present. 

•	 
A characteristic ultrasound finding is the wheel within a wheel or bull’s-eye appearance, which describes concentric hyperechoic and hypoechoic rings surrounding the abscess. 

•	 
Treatment is CT- or ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage in addition to antibiotics. 


Fungal abscess 
•	 
Splenic fungal abscesses are typically multiple and small, usually <1 cm in size. Almost all patients with splenic fungal abscesses are immunocompromised. 

•	 
The most common causative agents include Candida, Aspergillus, and Cryptococcus, all of which have a common appearance of multiple tiny hypoattenuating foci on CT. 

•	 
Splenic Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii) infection is rare, almost always seen in advanced AIDS, and has a classic appearance of multiple calcified splenic lesions. 



Echinococcal cyst 
•	 
Splenic involvement of Echinococcus granulosus infection is unusual, seen in only 1–3% of echinococcal infections, and is almost always associated with infection of other organs as well. 

•	 
An echinococcal cyst is a true cyst with a cellular lining. As with echinococcal abscesses elsewhere, characteristic imaging findings are a cystic lesion with internal undulating membrane and daughter cysts. 




Malignant splenic lesions 
Splenic lymphoma 
•	 
Splenic lymphoma is the most common splenic malignancy. 

•	 
Primary splenic lymphoma is rare, accounting for less than 1% of all cases of lymphoma, and usually presents as a solitary hypovascular mass. In contrast to splenic hamartoma or metastatic disease, primary splenic lymphoma may extend beyond the splenic capsule and involve adjacent organs. 

•	 
Secondary splenic involvement of systemic lymphoma is much more common. Four imaging presentations have been described, depending on the size of the lymphomatous masses: 


Miliary masses, in which discrete tiny masses may be difficult to see. Multiple small- to moderate-sized masses. One large mass. Splenomegaly without discrete mass. 
•	 
Conspicuity is highest on post-contrast T1-weighted images, where the involved portion of the spleen tends to be hypoenhancing. 

•	 
On ultrasound, lymphoma may appear cystic, but color Doppler shows internal flow. 



Splenic metastasis

Splenic metastasis (continued) 
•	 Splenic metastases may be solitary or multiple, cystic or solid. However, metastases to the spleen are rare, occurring in 2–9% of cancer patients. Most patients with splenic metastases already have confirmed widespread disease. 
Isolated splenic metastases are seen in only 5% of patients with metastatic involvement of the spleen. 
•	 
Theories for the low rate of splenic metastases include the antineoplastic properties of lymphoid-rich splenic tissue and lack of afferent lymphatics available to bring tumor cells into the spleen. 

•	 
The most common primary tumors known to metastasize to the spleen include breast, lung, ovarian, and melanoma. Ovarian cancer and melanoma typically cause cystic metastasis. 

•	 
Calcification is rare unless the primary is a mucinous adenocarcinoma. 


Angiosarcoma 
•	 
Angiosarcoma is a rare, extremely aggressive malignancy, with a 20% 6-month survival. 

•	 
Unlike hepatic angiosarcoma, the associations with Thorotrast, vinyl chloride, and arsenic have not been well-established. 

•	 
Angiosarcoma usually presents as a large, heterogeneous mass that may completely replace the normal spleen. Enhancement is variable and heterogeneous. 




Miscellaneous splenic lesions 
Splenic infarct 
•	 
Splenic infarcts are most commonly due to emboli (in older patients) and thrombosis (in younger patients with hematologic disease). 

•	 
Splenic infarct classically manifests as a wedge-shaped peripheral region of nonenhancement, but a more heterogeneous, mass-like appearance can also be seen. 

•	 
On MR, the affected regions may be T1 hyperintense if acute and hemorrhagic, while chronic infarcts are T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense. 

•	 
Lack of enhancement of the entire spleen should raise the concern for complete infarction, possibly due to a wandering spleen with torsion. 


Gamna-Gandy bodies 
•	 
Gamna-Gandy bodies are multiple tiny foci of hemosiderin deposition and are a sequela of portal hypertension. 

•	 
Other signs of portal hypertension and cirrhosis are usually apparent on imaging, such as splenomegaly, varices, recanalized umbilical vein, ascites, and a nodular liver contour. 

•	 
The hemosiderin deposits demonstrate low signal on all sequences. On in- and out-of-phase gradient-echo sequences, the longer TE of the in-phase images demonstrates blooming (relatively decreased signal on in-phase images), due to longer dephasing time and exaggeration of T2* effect. 



Gamna-Gandy bodies (continued) 

Axial in- and out-of-phase gradient echo MRI shows numerous low signal foci in the spleen which demonstrate blooming on in-phase imaging (right image) compared to out-of-phase imaging (left image), representing Gamna-Gandy bodies. Note cirrhotic morphology of the liver (nodular contour, widened fissures, multiple regenerative nodules). 

Gaucher disease 
•	 
Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive deficiency of glucocerebrosidase, leading to accumulation of glucocerebrosides in the reticuloendothelial system. 

•	 
Splenic manifestations of Gaucher disease include splenomegaly (almost always) and multiple splenic nodules (seen in one-third of Gaucher patients). 

•	 
Associated bony findings seen in Gaucher disease include the characteristic Erlenmeyer flask deformity of the distal femurs, femoral head avascular necrosis, and H-shaped vertebral bodies from endplate avascular necrosis. 




Splenic trauma 
Overview of splenic trauma 
•	 
The spleen is the most commonly injured abdominal organ in blunt trauma. 

•	 
Splenectomy dramatically increases the risk of subsequent sepsis, which has driven the trend towards splenic preservation and conservative management of splenic trauma. 

•	 
The spleen must be evaluated for injury in the portal venous phase, as physiologic heterogeneous enhancement in the arterial phase can both mask and mimic injury. 

•	 
A splenic hematoma is a focal collection of blood (hypoattenuating relative to enhanced spleen and hyperattenuating relative to unenhanced spleen), usually subcapsular in location. Less commonly, a hematoma may be intraparenchymal, where it is irregular in shape. 

•	 
A splenic laceration can only be well seen on a contrast-enhanced study, where it appears as a linear or branching area of decreased attenuation. 

•	 
Active contrast extravasation due to vessel injury appears as an area of increased attenuation (initially iso-enhancing to the arterial blood pool), which continues to increase in size or attenuation on delayed scanning due to pooling of extravasated blood. 

•	 
In contrast to active extravasation, pseudoaneurysm and arteriovenous (AV) fistula are contained vascular injuries that also initially appear as a focal area of increased attenuation, but do not increase in size on delayed scanning. 


A pseudoaneurysm is caused by injury to the intima and media of the arterial wall and is essentially a 
rupture contained only by the adventitia. There is a high chance of rupture without treatment. A traumatic AV fistula is indistinguishable from pseudoaneurysm by CT and is due to injury of an artery and the adjacent vein. Splenic arteriography is the only way to differentiate pseudoaneurysm from arteriovenous fistula. 

American Association for the Surgery of Trauma organ injury scale for spleen 
•	 
The 2018 revision of the AAST spleen injury scale takes into consideration the extent of injury seen on CT imaging, at operation, or on pathologic specimen. The highest-grade assessment represents the final grade assigned. 

•	 
The revision incorporates vascular injury seen on CT including active bleeding, pseudoaneurysm, and AV fistula as defined above. 

•	 
The CT imaging criteria is similar to that used for liver trauma. 

•	 
Grade I: 

•	 
Grade II: 


AAST spleen injury scale
•	 
•	 
Subcapsular hematoma <10% spleen surface. Tear of splenic capsule or superficial laceration <1 cm deep. 
Subcapsular hematoma 10–50% spleen surface. Intraparenchymal hematoma <5 cm in size. Laceration 1–3 cm deep. 
Grade III: Subcapsular hematoma >50% spleen surface. Ruptured subcapsular/intraparenchymal hematoma. Laceration >3 cm deep. 
Grade IV: Any intraparenchymal vascular injury (i.e., pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula) or contained active bleeding. Laceration involving central splenic vessels resulting in >25% devascularization. 
Extraparenchymal extension of active bleeding into the peritoneum. Shattered spleen. 
•	 
Grade V: 

•	 
When multiple injuries are present, advance one grade up to a grade III. 



Left image: Coronal contrast-enhanced CT demonstrates a large subcapsular hematoma (arrows) compressing the spleen, without evidence of active extravasation, in keeping with grade III splenic injury. 
Right image: Axial contrast-enhanced CT shows a shattered spleen (grade V) with surrounding hematoma.
