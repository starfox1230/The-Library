Branches of the SMA and IMA supply the colon as depicted in the diagram below. 

•	 
The ascending and descending colon are secondarily retroperitoneal structures. The transverse and sigmoid colons are intraperitoneal. The upper to mid rectum is partially covered by peritoneum; the lower third is extraperitoneal and surrounded by mesorectal fascia.

Colitis 
Overview of colitis 
•	 
Colitis is inflammation of the colon that may be caused by several unrelated etiologies, often with overlapping imaging findings. 

•	 
The primary imaging feature of colitis is wall thickening. Generally, a full clinical evaluation, stool studies, and sometimes colonic biopsy are required for a definitive diagnosis of the causative etiology. 



Ischemic colitis 
•	 
Colonic ischemia can be caused by acute arterial thrombus, chronic arterial stenosis, low-flow states (e.g., congestive heart failure), and venous thrombosis. 

•	 
The splenic flexure is the watershed region between the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries and is especially susceptible to ischemia in low-flow states. 

•	 
The rectum is supplied by a dual blood supply and is almost never affected by ischemia. The superior rectal artery (terminal branch of the IMA) and the inferior and middle rectal arteries (arising from the internal iliac artery anterior division) form perirectal collaterals. 

•	 
CT findings suggestive of ischemic colitis are segmental thickening of the affected colon in a vascular distribution, with sparing of the rectum. 


If arterial thromboembolic disease is suspected, one should evaluate for the presence of aortic atherosclerotic disease or a left atrial thrombus in the setting of atrial fibrillation. If chronic arterial stenosis is suspected, one should evaluate for atherosclerosis of the mesenteric vessels. 

Infectious colitis 
•	 
Infectious colitis can be bacterial, mycobacterial, viral, fungal, or amebic. There is significant overlap in the clinical presentation and imaging findings of the various pathogens. 

•	 
In general, infectious colitis features pericolonic stranding and ascites in addition to the colonic wall thickening seen in all forms of colitis. 

•	 
Yersinia, Salmonella, and colonic TB tend to affect the right colon. TB is known to involve the ileocecal valve, resulting in a desmoplastic reaction that mimics Crohn’s disease. 

•	 
E. coli, CMV, and C. difficile colitis (discussed below) most commonly cause pancolitis. 




Pseudomembranous colitis (C. diffi cile colitis) 
•	 
Pseudomembranous colitis is an especially prevalent form of infectious colitis caused by overgrowth of Clostridium difficile, most commonly due to alteration in colonic bacterial flora after antibiotic use. Pseudomembranous colitis may also occur without a history of antibiotics, especially in hospitalized or nursing home patients. Severely immunocompromised patients’ status post bone marrow or solid organ transplant is also at risk. 

•	 
Key imaging finding is marked thickening of the colonic wall, typically with involvement of the entire colon (pancolitis). The accordion sign describes severe colonic wall thickening combined with undulation of enhancing inner mucosa. It signifies severe colonic edema but is not specific to C. difficile. Thumbprinting is a fluoroscopic finding of thickened haustra and is also due to edema. 



Axial (left image) and coronal (right image) contrast-enhanced CT demonstrates diffuse bowel wall edema and mucosal enhancement of the entire colon (accordion sign) with pericolonic stranding and mesenteric vasculature engorgement, consistent with pseudomembranous colitis in this patient with fever, leukocytosis, and a positive C. diff. culture. 

Ulcerative colitis (UC) 
•	 Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease that begins distally in the rectum and spreads proximally in a continuous manner (unlike Crohn’s disease, which features skip areas). 
Of note, it is possible for the rectum to appear normal with more proximal colonic involvement present if the patient has been treated with corticosteroid enemas. 
•	 
Patients with UC have an increased risk of primary sclerosing cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma and colon cancer. 

•	 
Extra-abdominal manifestations of UC include sacroiliitis (symmetric, bilateral), iritis, erythema nodosum (tender red subcutaneous nodules), and pyoderma gangrenosum (cutaneous ulcers). 

•	 
UC does not extend more proximally than the cecum; however, backwash ileitis caused by reflux of inflammatory debris into the ileum may mimic Crohn's disease. 



Chronic ulcerative colitis: Coronal (left image) and axial (right) contrast-enhanced CT shows continuous thickening of the rectal wall (yellow arrows) with submucosal fat deposition (red arrows). 
•	 
Imaging of ulcerative colitis features circumferential wall thickening with a granular mucosal pattern that is best seen on barium enema. Pseudopolyps may be present during bouts of acute inflammation and represent islands of normal mucosa surrounded by inflamed mucosa. A collar-button ulcer is nonspecific but represents mucosal ulceration undermined by submucosal extension. 

•	 
Chronic changes of ulcerative colitis include a featureless (ahaustral) and foreshortened lead pipe colon. As in Crohn’s disease, submucosal fat deposition suggests chronic disease, as seen in the case above. 

•	 
Toxic megacolon is a severe complication of UC (and less commonly, Crohn's disease) caused by inflammation extending through the muscular layer. Imaging of toxic megacolon shows dilation of the colon to greater than 6 cm in association with adynamic ileus. Colonic perforation may occur, therefore colonoscopy is contraindicated in patients with suspected toxic megacolon. 



Typhlitis (neutropenic enterocolitis) 
•	 
Typhlitis is a necrotizing inflammatory colitis seen in the right colon and/or terminal ileum occurring in neutropenic patients. 

•	 
Imaging features may include cecal thickening, fat stranding, ileus or features of SBO, and even pneumatosis intestinalis. Low attenuation areas within the wall may represent edema or hemorrhage. 



Axial (left image) and coronal (right) contrast-enhanced CT shows marked circumferential wall thickening of the cecum and proximal ascending colon, with associate pericolonic fat stranding, in a neutropenic patient. 

Immunotherapy-related colitis 
•	 
As immunotherapy and molecular targeted therapies become more common, more cases of drug-related colitis are being reported. 

•	 
Imaging findings of drug-related colitis can be very subtle and include mild, diffuse bowel wall thickening, vasa recta engorgement, and fluid-filled colonic distention. The most common culprit immunotherapy agents are ipilimumab and pembrolizumab. 



Stercoral colitis 

Stercoral colitis: Axial contrast-enhanced CT demonstrates a distended, stool-filled rectum with circumferential wall thickening and mesorectal fat stranding. 
•	 
Stercoral colitis is focal inflammatory colitis caused by increased pressure on the bowel wall by impacted fecal material in the colon and/or rectum. 

•	 
It can lead to bowel wall ischemia, pressure ulceration (stercoral ulcer), and perforation. 

•	 
Imaging shows colonic distention by an intraluminal impacted fecal mass, with associated bowel wall thickening and pericolonic fat stranding. 




Other acute large bowel pathologies 
Diverticulitis 

Complicated diverticulitis: Axial CT shows a large Uncomplicated diverticulitis: Axial CT in a different diverticulum arising from the sigmoid colon containing patient shows fat stranding surrounding a enteric contrast (yellow arrow), with surrounding diverticulum at the hepatic flexure (arrow). mesenteric fat stranding. A few adjacent locules of extraluminal gas (red arrow) are present. 
•	 
Diverticulitis is acute inflammation of an obstructed colonic diverticulum, leading to diverticular wall ischemia and microperforation. CT is the primary modality for diagnosis, triage, and evaluation of severity and complications. 

•	 
Uncomplicated diverticulitis does not have any imaging evidence of bowel perforation (even though histopathologically, all diverticulitis is associated with bacterial translocation across the bowel wall/microperforation). CT findings of uncomplicated diverticulitis include short segment bowel wall thickening and pericolonic fat stranding, usually centered around a culprit diverticulum. Uncomplicated diverticulitis is typically treated conservatively. 

•	 
Complicated diverticulitis implies the presence of at least one of the following additional findings, including: 


Pericolonic or hepatic abscess.  Colonic fistula (colovesical fistula most common,  
Extraluminal air. Bowel obstruction.  apparent on imaging as gas in the bladder not explained by Foley catheter placement). Mesenteric venous thrombosis or septic  
thrombophlebitis.  

Diverticulitis (continued) 

Diverticulitis complicated by septic thrombophlebitis and hepatic abscesses: Axial contrast-enhanced CT images show complex multiloculated hepatic lesions (yellow arrows). There are filling defects within the inferior mesenteric vein draining the site of diverticulitis (not shown), main portal vein and right portal vein (red arrows). The constellation of findings are consistent with diverticulitis complicated by ascending septic thrombophlebitis and hepatic abscesses. 
•	 
Abscesses can usually be drained percutaneously with CT guidance. 

•	 
Pertinent positives to include in your report include the presence of extraluminal gas, fistula or abscess, or the clinical history of recurrent diverticulitis, as this may affect treatment algorithms. 

•	 
Due to the extensive colonic wall thickening that is sometimes seen, it can be difficult to distinguish acute diverticulitis from colon cancer. Depending on the level of certainty of diagnosis, some radiologists may recommend a follow-up CT or colonoscopy after resolution of the acute episode. 


Epiploic appendagitis 

Epiploic appendagitis: Coronal contrast-enhanced CT demonstrates an oval circumscribed area of fat with central tiny hyperdense dot (central dot sign). There is mild surrounding inflammatory stranding and focal area of peritoneal thickening. 
•	 
Epiploic appendagitis is a benign, clinical mimic of diverticulitis caused by torsion of a normal fatty tag (appendage) hanging from the colon. 

•	 
Epiploic appendagitis has a pathognomonic imaging appearance of an oval fat-attenuation lesion abutting a normal colonic wall, with mild associated fat stranding. The central dot sign refers to a central hyperdense dot in cross-section representing the thrombosed central vein of the epiploic appendage. 

•	 
Treatment is with anti-inflammatories, not antibiotics or surgery. 




Colorectal Carcinoma 
•	 
Colorectal carcinoma (98% of which is adenocarcinoma) is the most common malignancy of the GI tract and the second most frequently diagnosed malignancy in adults, more commonly affecting older adults with a slight male predilection. They most often arise in the rectosigmoid region but can occur anywhere from cecum to rectum. 

•	 
Rare subtypes include mucinous carcinoma of the colon and neuroendocrine carcinoma. 

•	 
There are many risk factors and associated syndromes, some of which are discussed elsewhere in this chapter. 


Risk factors: inflammatory bowel disease, low fiber/high fat diets, obesity, prior radiation, and family history of colorectal cancer among others. Associated syndromes: FAP, Gardner and Turcot syndrome variants, Peutz-Jeghers, HNPCC. 
•	 
CT colonography is increasingly being used as a non-invasive alternative to colonoscopy for screening. 

•	 
Many patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis obtained by screening colonoscopy or CT colonography, but may present with imaging findings of obstruction or perforation. Non-imaging clinical findings may include melena or frank GI bleeding, iron deficiency-anemia or altered bowel habits, which people may dismiss as being related to diet or aging. 

•	 
CT is the modality most often used for staging of colorectal carcinoma and can demonstrate evidence of nodal involvement or metastases. Most carcinomas appear as soft tissue density masses that may narrow the bowel lumen and can ulcerate when they become large. 

•	 
MRI is used for locoregional staging of rectal cancer to evaluate for T and N stage. 



Axial (left image) and coronal (right image) contrast-enhanced CT demonstrates asymmetric wall thickening of the cecum at the level of the ileocecal valve with mass-like protrusion (arrows). Pathology on biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma. 

Polyposis syndromes affecting the bowel 
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) 
•	 
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal-dominant syndrome featuring innumerable premalignant adenomatous polyps in the colon and to a lesser extent the small bowel. The risk of colon cancer is 100% with average onset of development at 39 years. Prophylactic colectomy is the standard of care to prevent colon cancer. 

•	 
Gastric polyps are also present, although the gastric polyps are hyperplastic and are not premalignant. 

•	 
Gardner syndrome is a variant of FAP. In addition to colon polyps, patients also have: 


Desmoid tumors. Osteomas. Papillary thyroid cancer. Epidermoid cysts. 
Mnemonic: DOPE Gardner 
•	 Turcot syndrome is another variant of FAP. In addition to colon polyps, patients also have CNS tumors (gliomas and medulloblastomas). 
Mnemonic: TURbans go over your head 

Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer syndrome (HNPCC) = Lynch syndrome 
•	 
Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) syndrome (also called Lynch syndrome) is an autosomal dominant polyposis syndrome caused by DNA mismatch repair, leading to colon cancer from microsatellite instability on a molecular level. Risk of colon cancer is less than with FAP. Similar to FAP, the colon polyps of HNPCC are adenomatous. 

•	 
HNPCC is associated with other cancers, including endometrial, gastric, small bowel, liver, and biliary malignancies. 



Peutz-Jeghers 
•	 
Peutz-Jeghers is an autosomal dominant syndrome that features multiple hamartomatous pedunculated polyps, usually in the small bowel. These polyps may act as lead points and cause intussusception. 

•	 
Characteristic skin manifestations include perioral mucocutaneous blue/brown pigmented spots on the lips and gums. 

•	 
Peutz-Jeghers is associated with gynecologic neoplasms as well as gastric, duodenal, and colonic malignancies. 



Cowden syndrome 
•	 
Cowden syndrome is an autosomal dominant syndrome of multiple hamartomatous polyps most commonly found in the skin and external mucous membranes, but also in the GI tract. 

•	 
Cowden syndrome is associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer (usually follicular), as well as skin, oral, breast, and uterine malignancies.
