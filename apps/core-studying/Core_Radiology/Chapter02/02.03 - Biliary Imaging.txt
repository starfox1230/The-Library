Biliary anatomical variants 
Low insertion of cystic duct 
•	 With a low insertion of the cystic duct, the surgeon may misidentify the common duct as the cystic duct if the patient undergoes cholecystectomy, possibly leading to inadvertent common duct ligation. 
Aberrant right posterior duct 
•	 An aberrant right posterior duct is only important if the patient is a right hepatic lobe liver donor, as the two right hepatic ducts need to be anastomosed separately in the recipient. 
Long common channel 
•	 
A long common channel is also known as pancreaticobiliary maljunction where the union of the CBD and pancreatic duct occurs outside the duodenal wall to form a long common channel (>15 mm). It may occur with or without biliary dilatation. 

•	 
This entity may be associated with choledochal cyst, bile duct stricture, and increased risk of biliary cancer. 




Gallstones and cholecystitis 
Cholelithiasis 

Single gallstone: Sagittal ultrasound of the gallbladder shows an echogenic gallstone (calipers) in the gallbladder neck, with posterior acoustic shadowing (arrows). 
•	 
Cholelithiasis is a gallbladder stone or stones, without associated inflammation. 

•	 
The classic clinical presentation of symptomatic cholelithiasis is colicky right upper quadrant pain after eating a fatty meal, but it is common to see gallstones incidentally in asymptomatic patients. 

•	 
Risk factors for developing gallstones include female sex, obesity, pregnancy, middle age, and diabetes. 

•	 
The ultrasound diagnosis of gallstones is usually straightforward. Stones are echogenic with posterior acoustic shadowing and are usually mobile. It is often helpful to reposition the patient (typically in the left lateral decubitus position) while scanning to assess whether the stones layer dependently to differentiate stones from polyps or other masses. 

•	 
A gallbladder completely full of stones can be more challenging to identify. The wall-echo­shadow (WES) sign describes a gallbladder full of multiple stones (or one giant stone). 



Wall-echo-shadow sign on ultrasound: Two parallel echogenic arcs represent the gallbladder wall and leading edge of the stone (yellow arrows), with an intervening thin layer of hypoechoic bile (red arrow). The gallstones cast a prominent shadow, obscuring evaluation of the remainder of the gallbladder wall, as in this image. 
•	 The differential diagnosis of echogenic material within the gallbladder includes: 
Gallstone(s) (echogenic, mobile, shadowing). Gallbladder sludge (echogenic, mobile, non-shadowing). Gallbladder polyp (echogenic, non-mobile, non-shadowing, often attached to the gallbladder wall via a 
stalk, may be vascular). Hyperplastic cholecystoses (echogenic, non-mobile, multiple polyps). Porcelain gallbladder (echogenic wall, shadowing). Adjacent bowel (echogenic wall, dirty shadowing). 
•	 
Acute calculus cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder due to an obstructing gallstone impacting the gallbladder neck or cystic duct. 

•	 
Patients typically present with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and fever. 



Acute calculus cholecystitis: Oblique sagittal ultrasound through the gallbladder demonstrates a thickened, echogenic gallbladder wall (arrows). The gallbladder contains numerous echogenic gallstones (red arrow). 
•	 
Ultrasound is the first-line evaluation of suspected acute cholecystitis. 

•	 
There is no sonographic finding that is 100% specific for acute cholecystitis. However, gallstones are seen >90% of the time and a positive sonographic Murphy’s sign (RUQ pain with pressure from the transducer during inspiration) also has a high positive predictive value. Other findings include: 


Gallbladder wall thickening >3 mm. Distended gallbladder >4 cm in diameter. Pericholecystic fluid or inflammatory changes in the pericholecystic fat. Color Doppler showing hyperemic gallbladder wall. 

Axial and coronal T2 MRI shows gallbladder wall edema (yellow arrows), perihepatic and pericholecystic fluid (red arrows), and small T2 hypointense stones within a distended gallbladder.

•	 Complications of acute cholecystitis are rare but serious and include: 
Emphysematous cholecystitis. Gangrenous cholecystitis. Gallbladder perforation. 
•	 Surgical treatment of uncomplicated acute calculous cholecystitis is cholecystectomy. In patients who are not good surgical candidates, a temporizing percutaneous cholecystostomy tube can be placed prior to definitive surgical cholecystectomy. 
GI: 132 
•	 
Acalculous cholecystitis is cholecystitis without gallstones, typically seen in very sick patients such as those in the ICU, thought to be due to bile stasis and hypoperfusion. Risk factors include sepsis, prolonged total parenteral nutrition, and trauma. 

•	 
The ultrasound appearance is similar to that of acute cholecystitis, but without the presence of an obstructing stone. Since many patients are ventilated or obtunded, it’s often not possible to evaluate for sonographic Murphy’s sign. 

•	 
Treatment of acalculous cholecystitis is typically percutaneous cholecystostomy by interventional radiology. Unlike the treatment of calculous cholecystitis, cholecystostomy is often the definitive therapy. 


Emphysematous cholecystitis 
•	 
Emphysematous cholecystitis is a severe complication of acute cholecystitis caused by gas-forming bacteria. It is rare but elderly diabetic patients are more susceptible. 

•	 
On imaging, gas may be present either within the lumen or the wall of the gallbladder. 

•	 
Treatment of emphysematous cholecystitis is most often emergent cholecystectomy or cholecystostomy in patients with a very high surgical risk. 



Grayscale ultrasound (left image) shows diffuse echogenic foci within the gallbladder wall corresponding to intramural foci of gas on axial CT (right image; arrows). 
Gangrenous cholecystitis 
•	 
Gangrenous cholecystitis is due to increased intraluminal pressure, leading to gallbladder wall ischemia and necrosis with high risk for gallbladder perforation. 

•	 
On imaging, gallbladder wall thickening may be notably asymmetric and intraluminal membranes may be present. 

•	 
Treatment is emergent cholecystectomy or cholecystostomy. 



Axial and coronal contrast-enhanced CT shows gallbladder wall edema and pericholecystic fluid. There is discontinuous mucosal enhancement of the medial gallbladder wall (red arrow) due to necrosis and perforation with spillage of contents into the right subhepatic space. 
•	 Acute gallbladder perforation has a very high mortality due to generalized bile peritonitis. Subacute perforation may lead to a pericholecystic abscess and chronic perforation may cause a cholecystoenteric fistula. 
Porcelain gallbladder 

Axial contrast-enhanced CT demonstrates a calcified gallbladder wall consistent with porcelain gallbladder, and multiple peripherally calcified gallstones. 
•	 
Porcelain gallbladder describes a peripherally calcified gallbladder wall, thought to be a sequela of chronic cholecystitis due to either chronic irritation from supersaturated bile or repeated bouts of gallbladder obstruction. 

•	 
Porcelain gallbladder is associated with a (somewhat controversial) increased risk of gallbladder carcinoma. Historically, prophylactic cholecystectomy was the standard of care; however, some advocate for observation in asymptomatic patients. 

•	 
On ultrasound, the gallbladder wall is echogenic and gallstones are almost always present. 

•	 
The differential diagnosis of an echogenic gallbladder wall includes: 


Porcelain gallbladder. A gallbladder packed full of stones (which will feature the wall-echo-shadow sign). Emphysematous cholecystitis (intramural gas will have dirty shadowing). Adjacent bowel confused for gallbladder (bowel wall, echogenic gas with dirty shadowing). 


Different etiologies of an echogenic gallbladder wall in three different patients: 
Top left image shows a porcelain gallbladder with associated posterior acoustic shadowing. 
Top right image demonstrates the wall-echo-shadow sign described earlier in the chapter. 
Bottom left image shows gallstones and dirty shadowing (yellow arrow) representing gas in the gallbladder, in this patient following biliary stent placement.  

Sagittal ultrasound of the gallbladder (left image, marked with calipers) demonstrates a massively distended gallbladder. The common bile duct (right image, indicated by calipers) is also distended due to chronic malignant obstruction. 
Case courtesy Julie Ritner, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
•	 
The Courvoisier gallbladder refers to a markedly dilated gallbladder (originally described as being so large to be directly palpable on physical exam) from malignant obstruction of the common bile duct. 

•	 
A markedly distended gallbladder without acute cholecystitis implies chronic obstruction of either the cystic duct (when seen in isolation) or the common bile duct (when seen in combination with dilation of the common bile duct and intrahepatic biliary dilation). 




Hyperplastic cholecystoses 
Overview of hyperplastic cholecystoses 
•	 The hyperplastic cholecystoses are a spectrum of non-neoplastic proliferative disorders caused by deposition of cholesterol-laden macrophages within the wall of the gallbladder. The cholecystoses range from abnormalities of the gallbladder wall (adenomyomatosis and strawberry gallbladder) to gallbladder polyps extending into the lumen. 
Adenomyomatosis 

Ultrasound shows multiple echogenic foci in the gallbladder wall that demonstrate comet tail artifact (yellow arrows). Coronal CT image shows focal wall thickening in the gallbladder fundus with enhancement (red arrow) consistent with adenomyomatosis. 
•	 Adenomyomatosis is cholesterol deposition in mural Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses. It is important not to confuse with adenomyosis of the uterus: It may be helpful to remember that there 
are three L’s in gallbladder, and adenomyomatosis is a longer word than adenomyosis. Another way to remember is that “gallbladder” is a longer word than “uterus”. 


•	 
Adenomyomatosis is often seen in the gallbladder fundus but can be diffuse or focal. It can be difficult to differentiate focal adenomyomatosis from malignancy. 

•	 
The ultrasound hallmark of adenomyomatosis is the comet-tail artifact due to reflections off tiny crystals seen in a focally thickened and echogenic gallbladder wall. 

•	 
The typical MRI appearance of adenomyomatosis is focal, bubbly T2 hyperintense thickening along the gallbladder fundus. 


Gallbladder polyps 
•	 
Most gallbladder polyps are benign cholesterol polyps that are part of the hyperplastic cholecystosis spectrum. Rarely (<5%), polyps may be premalignant adenomas. 

•	 
Gallbladder polyps are usually incidental and asymptomatic, but may cause right upper quadrant pain or even cholecystitis if they obstruct the cystic duct. 

•	 
The following characteristics, known as the six S’s, increase the risk for a polyp being malignant: 


Size >10 mm or rapid growth. As a caveat, ultrasound has limited sensitivity and specificity in detecting small polyps (<10 mm), especially in the presence of gallstones. 
Single: A solitary polyp is more suspicious for malignancy. In contrast, benign cholesterol polyps tend to be multiple. 
Sessile (broad-based): Sessile morphology is suspicious. A polyp is more likely benign if pedunculated. 
Stones: The presence of stones may induce chronic inflammation, which can predispose towards malignancy. 
Primary Sclerosing cholangitis increases risk of malignancy. 
Sixty (age) or greater.

from the wall into the lumen of the gallbladder. There may be vascular flow in the stalk. 

•	 The main differential consideration is adherent sludge, which will not have any vascular flow.

Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) 
Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) overview 

•	 
Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) involves specific sequences of an abdominal MRI acquired to image the biliary tree, utilizing heavily T2-weighted sequences that increase the contrast between T2 hyperintense stationary fluid in the biliary tract and the surrounding structures. 

•	 
Sequences with intermediate T2-weighting (TE 80–100 ms) are best suited for visualization of the biliary ductal system and surrounding tissue, in particular to evaluate extraluminal structures. 

•	 
Fast spin echo sequences are most commonly used for MRCP acquisition. Various techniques can be employed to optimize imaging including breath-hold sequences and respiratory-triggered sequences. 


•	  Advantages of MRCP over endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) include:  
MRCP is noninvasive.  
It does not require sedation.  
It has ability to visualize surrounding anatomy.  
•	  Disadvantages of MRCP compared to ERCP include:  
MRCP cannot simultaneously diagnose and treat abnormalities.  
•	  Contrast-enhanced MRCP can also be performed with fat-saturated T1-weighted imaging  
after injection of gadolinium contrast agents that have biliary excretion, such as gadoxetic  
acid disodium (Eovist). These agents shorten T1 relaxation, resulting in T1 hyperintense  
biliary fluid, but require at least a 20-minute delay prior to imaging to allow time for biliary  
excretion.

•	 
Choledochal cysts represent a heterogeneous group of diseases with a common end pathway of intrahepati c or extrahepati c biliary ductal dilati on. The Todani system divides the cysts into types I–V based on their number, distributi on, and morphology. 

•	 
Most choledochal cysts are diagnosed in childhood, but less commonly may be a new diagnosis for an adult. Clinically, choledochal cysts can present with nonspecifi c abdominal pain or may be found incidentally. Choledochal cysts are oft en resected due to increased cholangiocarcinoma risk, which can be as high as 25%. 

•	 
In contrast to biliary hamartomas, choledochal cysts do communicate with the biliary tree. 



Type I choledochal cyst: ERCP (left image) and thick-slab coronal MRCP heavily T2-weighted sequence (right image) shows a fusiform dilation of common bile duct (arrows). 
•	 A type I choledochal cyst, representing fusiform dilation of the common bile duct, is the most common type of extrahepatic cyst. 
Caroli disease (Type V choledochal cysts) 
•	 
Caroli disease represents saccular dilation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, which may be segmental or diffuse. Caroli disease may be associated with polycystic kidneys. 

•	 
Caroli syndrome is Caroli disease plus hepatic fibrosis. 

•	 
The central-dot sign describes the small branches of the portal vein and hepatic artery bridging the dilated bile ducts, which look like a central dot on contrast-enhanced CT. 



Axial and coronal T2-weighted MRI images demonstrate dilated intrahepatic bile ducts (arrows) throughout the liver consistent with Caroli disease. The common bile duct (red arrow) is normal caliber. 
Choledocholithiasis 

Choledocholithiasis: Sagittal ultrasound (left image) of the porta hepatis demonstrates common bile duct dilation (calipers) to 1.1 cm. Transverse scan (right image) through the region of the head of the pancreas shows an echogenic gallstone within the distal common bile duct (arrow). 
•	 
Choledocholithiasis is a stone in the common bile duct, generally treated with ERCP. 

•	 
Patients may be asymptomatic, but more often have right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting and cholestatic pattern of LFT abnormalities secondary to obstructed bile outflow. 


Mirizzi syndrome 
•	 
Mirizzi syndrome is inflammation and external compression of the common hepatic duct (CHD) caused by a stone in the adjacent cystic duct. It is essential for the surgeon to know about preoperatively because the CHD may be mistakenly ligated instead of the cystic duct. Additionally, inflammation can cause the gallstone to erode into the CHD and cause a cholecystocholedochal fistula and biliary obstruction. 

•	 
On ultrasound, a stone is typically impacted in the distal cystic duct and the CHD is dilated. The cystic duct tends to run in parallel with the CHD. 




Mirizzi syndrome: 
Top left image: Coronal contrast-enhanced CT demonstrates a peripherally calcified gallstone (yellow arrow) at level of the gallbladder neck, causing mass effect on the adjacent common hepatic duct (red arrows). 
Top right image: Axial T2-weighted MRI shows the gallstone (yellow arrow) within the neck of the gallbladder with adjacent layering sludge. 
Bottom left image: Coronal MRCP image better demonstrates the external compression of the common hepatic duct (red arrows) by the gallstone (yellow arrow). Note the resultant moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. 
Pneumobilia 
•	 Pneumobilia is air in the biliary tree. It is commonly seen after sphincterotomy or biliary-to­enteric anastomosis, but rarely may be due to cholecystoenteric fistula or emphysematous cholecystitis. 
Modality  Pneumobilia  Portal venous gas  
CT/MRI  • Branching gas • Seen more centrally  • Branching gas • Extends to liver periphery  
Ultrasound  • Branching echogenic foci with dirty shadowing  • Branching echogenic foci with dirty shadowing • Causes “spiky” spectral Doppler waveform  
*Gas can be difficult to visualize by MRI; gas is T1 and T2 hypointense and causes “blooming” (more prominent low signal) on in-phase images.  


Pneumobilia (central). Portal venous gas (peripheral). 
Biliary ductal dilation 
•	 A rule of thumb for assessing the common bile duct (CBD) diameter is to assume that the CBD should be 6 mm or less before age 60, but may still be normal if 1 mm larger per decade after that age. For example, an 8 mm duct in an 80-year-old patient may be considered normal. 
Some sources, however, suggest very small differences with age (mean duct diameter of 3.6 mm for 60-year-old patients and 4.0 mm for 85-year-old patients). For the hepatic ducts, >2 mm in size or >40% of the adjacent portal vein diameter is abnormal. 
•	 
The common bile duct is often mildly dilated in patients who have undergone cholecystectomy, usually 10 mm or less. 

•	 
In general, malignancy causes more prominent ductal dilation than benign disease. 




Bile duct infection and inflammation 
Ascending cholangitis 

Axial contrast-enhanced CT (left image) demonstrates fat stranding and edema around the common bile duct (arrows), which is dilated, with wall thickening and enhancement and contains small amount of intraluminal gas (patient has a history of sphincterotomy). Subsequent coronal post-contrast T1-weighted MRI (right image) also shows common bile duct wall thickening and hyperenhancement. These findings are highly suspicious for cholangitis. 
•	 
Obstruction of the biliary tree, most commonly due to choledocholithiasis, may cause ascending cholangitis, which presents with the clinical triad of fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice (Charcot’s triad). 

•	 
Imaging may be completely normal, although when abnormal, the key findings are hyperenhancement and thickening of the walls of the bile ducts, often with intraluminal debris and/or choledocholithiasis. 


Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) 

Primary sclerosing cholangitis: ERCP (left image) and thick-slab coronal MRCP heavily T2-weighted sequence (right image), show a beaded, irregular appearance to the intrahepatic bile ducts. 
Case courtesy Cheryl Sadow, MD, Brigham and Women's Hospital. 
•	 
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is idiopathic inflammation and destruction of bile ducts. 

•	 
PSC is associated with ulcerative colitis (UC) and to a lesser extent, Crohn's disease, and is 


more common in males. Most (75%) patients with PSC have UC, while only a few (4–5%) of patients with UC have PSC. 
•	 Biliary imaging shows a characteristic beaded, irregular appearance of the common bile duct and intrahepatic bile ducts. 
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC; continued) 
•	 
PSC appearance is similar to that of AIDS cholangiopathy, although cholangitis in HIV/AIDS patients is more commonly associated with papillary stenosis. 

•	 
Long-term complications of PSC include cirrhosis (often seen with prominent caudate lobe hypertrophy), cholangiocarcinoma, and recurrent biliary infections. Cross-sectional imaging is better at evaluating for these complications compared to ERCP. 


Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) 
•	 
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is inflammation and destruction of smaller bile ducts. Compared to PSC, PBC usually affects middle-aged women and often presents with pruritus. 

•	 
Similar to PSC, chronic PBC can lead to hepatic cirrhosis, often with prominent caudate lobe hypertrophy. 


AIDS cholangitis (AIDS cholangiopathy) 
•	 
Patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome are susceptible to biliary infection with Cryptosporidium and CMV, which clinically present with right upper quadrant pain, fever, and elevated LFTs. 

•	 
The imaging of AIDS cholangitis appears nearly identical to PSC, with multiple strictures and a beaded appearance of the bile ducts. A distinguishing feature of AIDS cholangitis is papillary stenosis, which is not typically seen in PSC. 


Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (oriental cholangiohepatitis) 
•	 
Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, also known as oriental cholangiohepatitis, is thought to be caused by the parasite Clonorchis sinensis, which leads to pigment stone formation, biliary stasis, and cholangitis. Nutritional deficiency may also play a role. The disease is typically observed in patients from Southeast Asia. 

•	 
Clinically, patients present with recurrent jaundice and fevers. 

•	 
Recurrent pyogenic cholangitis features an imaging triad of: 

1) Pneumobilia. 
2) Lamellated bile duct filling defects. 
3) Intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct dilation and strictures. 

•	 
Patients with recurrent pyogenic cholangitis have an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma. 


Biliary cystadenoma/cystadenocarcinoma 

Axial (left image) and coronal T2-weighted (right) images demonstrate multiseptated T2 hyperintense lesion in segment IV consistent with a biliary cystadenoma. There is also a small adjacent cystic lesion in segment II that may be an additional biliary cystadenoma or hepatic cyst. 
•	 
Biliary cystadenoma is a benign cystic neoplasm occurring predominantly in middle-aged women. Biliary cystadenoma may be quite large at presentation and cause nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and obstructive jaundice. 

•	 
Biliary cystadenoma does not communicate with the biliary system. 

•	 
On imaging, biliary cystadenoma appears as a large, multiloculated, cystic mass. The presence of septations distinguishes cystadenoma from a simple cyst. The septations may mimic an echinococcal cyst. In contrast to hepatic abscess or necrotic metastasis, a thick enhancing wall is not a feature of cystadenoma. 

•	 
Due to risk of malignant degeneration to biliary cystadenocarcinoma (occurs in up to 15% of patients), resection is often pursued. The presence of frank invasion into adjacent liver, a large solid component or thick calcification should raise concern for cystadenocarcinoma. 



Cholangiocarcinoma 
•	 
Cholangiocarcinoma is a highly malignant tumor of the biliary ductal epithelium and is the second most common primary hepatic mass. 

•	 
It classically presents with painless jaundice. Most cases of cholangiocarcinoma are sporadic, although key risk factors include chronic biliary disease (in the United States) and liver fluke infection (in the Far East). 

•	 
There are three main subtypes: Mass forming cholangiocarcinoma. Periductal cholangiocarcinoma: most often at the confluence of the right and left hepatic biliary ducts 


(known as Klatskin tumor). Intraductal cholangiocarcinoma: has variable imaging appearance. 

Contrast-enhanced CT T2-weighted MRI MRCP MIP image Klatskin tumor: Coronal contrast-enhanced CT and T2-weighted MRI show an enhancing, mildly T2 hyperintense tumor (arrows) at the common hepatic duct bifurcation, resulting in moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. 
•	 
Cholangiocarcinoma tends to obstruct bile ducts and lead to intrahepatic ductal dilation and capsular retraction. Eventually, the obstruction may lead to lobar atrophy. 

•	 
Risk factors for development of cholangiocarcinoma include: 


Choledochal cyst(s). Primary sclerosing cholangitis. Familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome. Clonorchis sinensis infection. Thorium dioxide (alpha-emitter contrast agent), not used since the 1950s. Thorium dioxide is also 
associated with angiosarcoma and HCC. 

Coronal T2-weighted (left image) and post-contrast T1-weighted (right image) MRI demonstrates an intraluminal enhancing mass within the gallbladder (yellow arrows) and an associated porta hepatis mass (red arrows) resulting in severe intra- and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. Pathology upon resection showed gallbladder carcinoma with metastatic pancreaticoduodenal lymph node. 
•	 
Gallbladder cancer is a rare malignancy with a poor prognosis. A typical clinical presentation may include right upper quadrant pain, weight loss, and jaundice. 

•	 
Gallstones and concomitant chronic cholecystitis are typically present. Porcelain gallbladder, a result of chronic cholecystitis, is thought to be a risk factor for gallbladder cancer, although this is controversial. 

•	 
Gallbladder carcinoma most commonly presents as a scirrhous infiltrating mass that invades through the gallbladder wall into the liver. Less commonly, gallbladder carcinoma may appear as a polypoid mass. Very rarely it can present as focal mural thickening. 

•	 
Tumor spread is via direct extension into the liver, although lymphatic and hematogenous metastases are also common. Prognosis is generally poor, although small polypoid lesions may undergo curative resection. 

•	 
Risk factors for development of gallbladder cancer include: 


Gallstones and chronic cholecystitis. Porcelain gallbladder (somewhat controversial). Primary sclerosing cholangitis. Inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis more frequently than Crohn's disease). Adenomatous polyp >10 mm or with multiple risk factors, as described above. 

Gallbladder metastases 
•	 
Metastases to the gallbladder are uncommon. 

•	 
Hepatocellular carcinoma can spread directly to the gallbladder through the bile ducts. 

•	 
Melanoma can spread hematogenously to the gallbladder mucosa.
