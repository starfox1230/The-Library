Pancreas 
Normal ductal anatomy 
•	 Normally, the main pancreatic duct drains to the major papilla (the ampulla of Vater) 
through the duct of Wirsung, while the duct of Santorini drains to the minor papilla. The sphincter of Oddi is a circular band of muscle encircling the ampulla of Vater.

•	 
Mnemonic for normal anatomy: Santorini is superior and drains to small (minor) papilla. 

•	 
The following anatomy is always constant, regardless of whether an anomaly is present: 


1) The common bile duct always drains to the major papilla where it meets the duct of Wirsung. 
2) The dorsal pancreatic duct always drains the pancreatic tail. 
3) The duct of Santorini always drains to the minor papilla. 

Congenital pancreatic anomalies 
Pancreas divisum 
•	 Pancreas divisum is the most common congenital pancreatic ductal anomaly. It is caused by failure of fusion of the ventral and dorsal pancreatic ducts. The ventral duct (Wirsung) only drains the ventral portion of the pancreas while the dorsal portion (majority) of the exocrine gland output is drained through the smaller duct of Santorini into the minor papilla.

•	 
Pancreas divisum increases the risk for pancreatitis due to the inability of the minor papilla to adequately drain the majority of the pancreatic parenchyma. 

•	 
Treatment is sphincterotomy or stenting. 



Pancreas divisum (continued) 
•	 The crossing duct sign describes the common bile duct crossing over the main duct to join the duct of Wirsung. Crossing duct sign of pancreas divisum: Thick-slab coronal MRCP heavily T2­weighted sequence shows the common bile duct (CBD) crossing the main pancreatic duct (MPD) at the arrow. The CBD courses towards the ventral pancreatic duct (VPD) to empty into the major papilla. The main/dorsal 
pancreatic duct drains separately into the minor papilla.

Annular pancreas 
•	 Annular pancreas is a rare congenital anomaly where a portion of the pancreas encircles the duodenum, secondary to incomplete rotation of the ventral pancreatic bud. 

Annular pancreas: Axial (left image) and sagittal (right image) contrast-enhanced CT shows circumferential encircling of the pancreas (Panc) around the duodenum (D), which is filled with oral contrast. 
Case courtesy Cheryl Sadow, MD, Brigham and Women's Hospital. 
•	 In a neonate, it presents with duodenal obstruction and is in the differential for the double bubble sign (discussed further in the “Pediatrics” chapter). In an adult, annular pancreas can cause pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease, and duodenal obstruction. 
Common channel syndrome / pancreaticobiliary maljunction 
•	 
Normally the common bile duct and duct of Wirsung (main pancreatic duct) both drain to the major papilla, where there is usually a thin septum separating these two systems. In common channel syndrome, also known as pancreaticobiliary maljunction, this septum is absent, allowing reflux between the two systems. 

•	 
Common channel syndrome may predispose to choledochal webs, choledochal cysts, pancreatitis and cholangiocarcinoma. 



Pancreatitis 
•	 
Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas, which may be due to a variety of etiologies that share a final common pathway of premature activation of pancreatic enzymes and resultant autodigestion of pancreatic parenchyma. 

•	 
Pancreatitis may range in severity from mild self-limited disease to necrotizing infection resulting in multiorgan failure and death. 


Ultrasound role of imaging 
•	 
Ultrasound is useful in the initial evaluation of clinically suspected acute pancreatitis to evaluate for gallstones, choledocholithiasis or biliary obstruction. 

•	 
Ultrasound has limited utility in evaluating complications of pancreatitis such as pancreatic necrosis or peripancreatic fluid collections. 


CT protocol and role of imaging 
•	 
Imaging of pancreatitis is ideally performed in the pancreatic phase (late arterial; ~40 seconds after contrast injection when the pancreatic parenchyma is maximally enhancing), which is the optimal time to detect subtle areas of decreased enhancement suggestive of necrosis. 

•	 
CT may be helpful when the clinical presentation is equivocal for pancreatitis, a patient is critically ill or worsening over time, to assess for severity, detect complications, and guide treatment. 

•	 
CT imaging is not indicated in patients with clinical diagnosis of mild acute pancreatitis, especially if they are improving. CT imaging may be negative or show a mildly edematous pancreas in these cases. 


MR protocol and role of imaging 
•	 
MRI is indicated for evaluation of etiology (i.e., choledocholithiasis), edema, necrosis, associated neoplasm, and the pancreatic duct. 

•	 
Different sequences in MRI with MRCP assess for the following pancreatic abnormalities: 


MR Sequence  Can evaluate for  
T2-weighted fat saturation  Edema and fluid collections  
MRCP  Biliary tree and pancreatic duct  
Pre-contrast T1-weighted  Pancreatic parenchymal bulk and signal (normally, pancreas should be the brightest organ)  
T1 post-contrast at 30, 60, and 90 seconds  Pancreatic parenchymal enhancement, vascular complications and fluid collections  
Subtraction  Best to evaluate for pancreatic necrosis  

Acute pancreatitis 

Acute pancreatitis on CT and ultrasound: 
Contrast-enhanced axial CT (left image) demonstrates diffuse pancreatic enlargement and peripancreatic edema. The pancreatic parenchyma enhances uniformly, without evidence for necrosis. 
Transverse ultrasound (right image) of the head and body of the pancreas shows a diffusely enlarged, heterogeneous pancreas (arrows) due to pancreatic edema. 
Ultrasound case courtesy Julie Ritner, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston. 
•	 
Acute pancreatitis is most commonly caused by alcohol use or an obstructing gallstone. 

•	 
There are two morphologic subtypes: 

1. 
Interstitial edematous pancreatitis 

2. 
Necrotizing pancreatitis 



•	 
Acute pancreatitis can be classified either with the Balthazar grading system or by the CT severity index. 

•	 
Pancreatic and peripancreatic complications of pancreatitis: 

•	 
Any of the above collections may be sterile or infected. The presence of gas suggests infection, but the absence of gas does not exclude infection. 

•	 
Extra-pancreatic complications: Perihilar renal inflammation, which may lead to venous compression or thrombosis. Bowel involvement, may see ileus or even a fistula, often to the transverse colon or duodenum. 

•	 
Secondary inflammation of adjacent vessels can cause vascular complications: 


< 4 weeks  > 4 weeks  
Acute peripancreatic fluid collection: Non-encapsulated fluid collection.  Pseudocyst: Encapsulated fluid collection. A pancreatic pseudocyst is a collection of pancreatic enzymes and fluid enclosed by a fibrous wall lacking an epithelial lining. The fibrous wall usually takes about 4–6 weeks to mature.  
Acute necrotic collection: Non-encapsulated collection containing heterogeneous material.  Walled-off necrosis: Encapsulated heterogeneous, non-liquified collection with thick walls.  

Pseudoaneurysm, due to erosion, most commonly of the splenic artery or gastroduodenal artery and may result in hemorrhage. Venous thrombosis, most commonly splenic vein thrombosis, which may lead to portal hypertension. 
Chronic pancreatitis 

Abdominal radiograph (left image) and contrast-enhanced axial CT (right image) show numerous coarse calcifications in the pancreas (arrows). 
•	 
Chronic pancreatitis, most commonly from long-term alcohol abuse, causes irreversible pancreatic damage. A much less common cause of chronic pancreatitis is pancreas divisum. 

•	 
The classic appearance of chronic pancreatitis is an atrophied gland, with diffuse 


calcifications and a dilated and beaded distal pancreatic duct. Calcifications in the distribution of the pancreatic duct are pathognomonic for chronic pancreatitis. Splenic artery calcifications are commonly seen in this region and can be mistaken for pancreatic 
calcifications; check to see if they follow the course of a vessel. 
Groove pancreatitis 
•	 Groove pancreatitis is an uncommon form of focal pancreatitis located in the groove between the head of the pancreas, duodenum, and common bile duct. Groove pancreatitis usually affects young men who are heavy drinkers. The main differential consideration is adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas. 

Illustration demonstrates inflammation within the groove between the head of the pancreas, duodenum, and common bile duct. 
•	 The histopathologic hallmark is fibrosis in the pancreaticoduodenal groove. Chronic inflammation of the duodenum can cause duodenal stenosis or cystic change of the duodenal wall. Duodenal thickening and cystic change are often apparent on imaging with cystic change best appreciated on MRI. 

Groove pancreatitis: Axial (left image) and coronal (right image) contrast-enhanced CT shows fat stranding in the pancreaticoduodenal groove (arrows) between the second portion of the duodenum and pancreatic head. 
Autoimmune pancreatitis 

Segmental autoimmune pancreatitis: Contrast-enhanced axial CT (left image) shows a segmental region of low attenuation enlargement of the pancreatic tail and body (arrows), with loss of the normal ductal architecture. 
T1-weighted unenhanced MRI (right image) shows a corresponding segmental loss of the normal T1­hyperintense pancreatic signal, with effacement of the pancreatic duct in the affected body and tail. 
The differential diagnosis for this appearance would include pancreatic lymphoma, less likely pancreatic adenocarcinoma as there is no ductal dilation. 
Case courtesy Cheryl Sadow, MD, Brigham and Women's Hospital. 
•	 
Autoimmune pancreatitis is the pancreatic manifestation of IgG4-related sclerosing disease. 

•	 
The typical imaging appearance of autoimmune pancreatitis is diffuse, sausage-like enlargement of the pancreas with loss of lobulation. A capsule-like rim may be seen. The appearance can also be focal or multifocal, which may mimic a pancreatic mass. 

•	 
Treatment is with steroids, which can lead to a complete resolution. 


Immunotherapy-related changes 
•	 Immunotherapy can lead to episodes of pancreatitis (which may be clinically occult) and can result in pancreatic atrophy. 


Overview of pancreatic neoplasms 



Solid epithelial Neoplasm 
Cystic epithelial neoplasm 
Endocrine neoplasm 

80–90% of pancreatic tumors rare, aggressive, can cause fat necrosis 
benign, many small cysts, elderly women malignant potential, surgical lesion single or few large cysts, middle-aged women 
young women, heterogeneous, prone to hemorrhage malignant potential, elderly males 
most are benign and small causes Zollinger-Ellison syndrome 

Solid pancreatic epithelial neoplasms 
Adenocarcinoma (ductal adenocarcinoma) 

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma of the head causing the double duct sign: Two coronal images from a contrast-enhanced CT show marked dilation of the common bile duct (CBD), moderate dilation of the pancreatic duct (PD), and the obstructing, ill-defined hypoattenuating mass in the pancreatic head (red arrows). 
•	 
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma accounts for 80–90% of all pancreatic tumors. It is typically seen in patients over age 60, with a slight male predominance. Risk factors include smoking, alcohol use, chronic pancreatitis, and family history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. 

•	 
A pancreatic mass protocol CT includes early arterial phase, late arterial phase (pancreatic phase), and portal venous phase images. The late arterial phase (pancreatic parenchymal phase) has the greatest conspicuity for detecting the hypoenhancing tumor against the background enhancing pancreas. 

•	 
The most common location for a tumor to arise is the pancreatic head where it often causes ductal obstruction. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is usually hypoenhancing relative to pancreatic parenchyma and results in upstream (towards the tail) ductal dilatation and parenchymal atrophy. The double duct sign describes dilation of both the pancreatic duct and the CBD due to obstruction by the pancreatic head mass. 

•	 
Since pancreatic adenocarcinoma is almost always associated with a dilated pancreatic duct, an alternative diagnosis should be strongly considered if there is a pancreatic mass with no ductal dilation, such as: 

•	 
Conversely, if a dilated pancreatic duct or double duct sign is present but no mass is visible, one should still be suspicious for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Approximately 10% of lesions will be isoattenuating relative to pancreas and/or difficult to visualize on a portal venous phase CT and thus extremely difficult to detect. 

•	 
When evaluating whether a pancreatic neoplasm is resectable, it is important to evaluate for any vascular variants and to determine tumor involvement of the nearby vessels: SMA (including first jejunal branch), SMV, portal vein, celiac axis, common hepatic artery, and splenic artery. 


Autoimmune pancreatitis.  Duodenal gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).  
Groove pancreatitis.  Peripancreatic lymph node.  
Cystic pancreatic tumor.  Pancreatic metastasis (e.g., renal cell, thyroid, or melanoma).  
Neuroendocrine tumor.  Lymphoma.  

Abutment: <180° circumferential contact with vessel. Encasement: >180° circumferential contact and/or deformation of the vessel. 
•	 Limited extension to the duodenum, distal stomach, or CBD does not preclude resection, as these structures are resected during a Whipple procedure. 
Acinar cell carcinoma 

Acinar cell carcinoma: Axial (left image) and coronal (right image) contrast-enhanced CT shows a large pancreatic tail mass with mixed soft tissue and fluid attenuation and surrounding fat stranding. The mass effaces and possibly invades the greater curvature of the stomach and left kidney. 
•	 
Acinar cell carcinoma is a rare, aggressive variant of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, exclusively seen in elderly males. 

•	 
The malignant cells produce a large amount of lipase which leads to the clinical triad of lipase hypersecretion syndrome: subcutaneous fat necrosis, bone infarcts causing polyarthralgias, and eosinophilia. 



Cystic pancreatic epithelial neoplasms 
Solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) 

Solid pseudopapillary tumor: Axial T2-weighted (left image) and post-contrast T1-weighted (right image) MRI demonstrates a mixed solid and cystic lesion arising from the tail of the pancreas with heterogeneous internal enhancement and a T2 hypointense, enhancing capsule (arrows). 
•	 
Solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT), formerly known as solid and papillary epithelial neoplasm (SPEN), occurs in young women and children and is nicknamed the daughter tumor. It may rarely cause abdominal pain but is often asymptomatic. It is more often located in the tail. 

•	 
It has a low malignant potential and is typically resected. 

•	 
On imaging, SPT appears as a large mass with heterogeneous solid and cystic areas. Hemorrhage is typical. SPT features a capsule, the only other pancreatic tumor with a capsule is mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN) (below). 



Mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN) 

Mucinous cystic neoplasm: Axial unenhanced CT shows a cystic, peripherally calcified mass in the tail of the pancreas (arrow). Pathology at resection showed borderline malignancy. 
Case courtesy Cheryl Sadow, MD, Brigham and Women's Hospital. 
•	 
Mucinous cystic neoplasm affects middle-aged women and has therefore been nicknamed the mother tumor. 

•	 
It is benign but does have malignant potential, so treatment is typically resection. 

•	 
The tumor consists of a single or a few large cysts (<6 cysts that are >2 cm) and typically occurs in the pancreatic body and tail. 

•	 
MCN has a capsule. When calcifications are seen, they tend to be peripheral.  


Serous cystadenoma 

Serous cystadenoma in two different patients: 
Axial oral-contrast-only CT (left image) shows a large multicystic pancreatic mass containing central stellate calcification (yellow arrow). Axial T2-weighted MRI (right image) shows a T2 hyperintensity multicystic mass in the pancreatic head with innumerable thin internal septations (red arrows). 
Left case courtesy Cheryl Sadow, MD, Brigham and Women's Hospital. 
•	 
Serous cystadenoma is a benign tumor that occurs in elderly women and has been nicknamed the grandmother tumor. 

•	 
Serous cystadenoma consists of many small cysts (>6 cysts that are <2 cm) that can appear as a “bunch of grapes” or may have a solid appearance on CT due to apposition of many cyst walls. MRI is useful to show the cystic nature of the lesion. 

•	 
Classic imaging feature is a central enhancing scar with stellate calcification.

Solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT)  Daughter  "SPry, goes to spin class"  + capsule cystic and solid  
Mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN)  Mother  "Motherly"  + capsule cystic  
Serous cystadenoma  Grandmother  "SEnile"  SEntral (central) enhancing scar with stellate calcification; "bunch of grapes"  


Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) 
•	 
Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) occurs most commonly in elderly males and is nicknamed the grandfather tumor, although these tumors exhibit the greatest age and sex variability of the cystic pancreatic neoplasms. 

•	 
IPMNs are considered premalignant neoplasms and also increase the risk of developing a primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma, so these lesions are followed to ensure stability. 

•	 
IPMNs may arise from the main pancreatic duct (MPD) or a side branch. The main duct and mixed-type IPMNs have greater malignant potential. 


Main duct IPMN  Branch duct IPMN  Mixed type  
Definition  Segmental or diffuse dilatation of MPD >5 mm  Cysts >5 mm communicating with the MPD  Meets criteria for both main duct and branch duct type  
Illustration  
 
 


Main duct IPMN: Axial (left image) and coronal (right image) T2-weighted MRI in a patient with history of chronic pancreatitis shows pancreatic atrophy and main duct dilation (arrows). This was found on pathology to be a main duct IPMN. 

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN; continued) 
•	 The Fukuoka consensus guidelines (2017) for IPMNs and MCNs recommend imaging with CT or MRI for cysts greater than 5 mm. Further evaluation with either endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or resection is recommended based on the following imaging features: 
Worrisome features (should be evaluated by EUS) 
• 
Cyst =3 cm 

• 
Enhancing mural nodule <5 mm 

• 
Thickened enhanced cyst walls 

• 
MPD 5–9 mm 

• 
Abrupt change in the MPD caliber with distal parenchymal atrophy 

• 
Lymphadenopathy 

• 
Elevated CA 19-9 

• 
Rapid rate of cyst growth >5 mm over two years High-risk stigmata (should undergo resection without further testing) 

• 
Obstructive jaundice 

• 
Enhancing mural nodule =5 mm 

• 
MPD =10 mm 



Pancreatic endocrine neoplasms 
Overview 
•	 
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors may be hyperfunctioning or non-hyperfunctioning. 

•	 
Hyperfunctioning tumors come to clinical attention due to symptoms of endocrine excess. 

•	 
Non-hyperfunctioning tumors tend to be larger at diagnosis. These tumors may undergo cystic change and should be considered in the differential of a cystic pancreatic neoplasm. There is often central necrosis and calcification in these large tumors as well. 

•	 
Pancreatic endocrine tumors tend to be hypervascular and are best seen in the late arterial phase. Most are solid unless very large in size. A hypervascular liver mass with an associated pancreatic mass is most likely a metastatic lesion from a pancreatic endocrine neoplasm. 



Insulinoma 
•	 
Insulinoma is the most common pancreatic endocrine tumor. Due to symptoms of hypoglycemia, insulinomas tend to present early and have the best prognosis of all neuroendocrine tumors with only 10% demonstrating malignant behavior. 

•	 
The Whipple triad describes the clinical symptoms of insulinoma: Hypoglycemia, clinical symptoms of hypoglycemia, and alleviation of symptoms after administration of glucose. 



Gastrinoma 
•	 
Gastrinoma is the second most common pancreatic endocrine tumor. Liver metastases are present at the time of diagnosis in 60% of patients. 

•	 
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is a clinical syndrome that occurs secondary to a gastrinoma. Hypersecretion of gastrin leads to gastritis, diarrhea, peptic ulcer disease and even gastroesophageal reflux disease. 

•	 
Gastrinoma is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 and in this case tends to be multiple and located in the duodenum rather than the pancreas. 



Gastrinoma (continued) 
•	 
The gastrinoma triangle describes the typical location of gastrinomas in an area bounded by the junction of the cystic duct and CBD, the duodenum inferiorly, and the neck/body of the pancreas medially. 

•	 
High gastrin levels can lead to formation of carcinoid tumors in the stomach, which may regress after the gastrinoma is resected. 



Other pancreatic endocrine tumors 
•	 
Glucagonoma is the third most common pancreatic endocrine tumor. Patients may present with migratory rash, diabetes, and glossitis. They have a high rate of malignant behavior (~80%) and 50–60% have liver metastases at diagnosis. Prognosis is poor. 

•	 
VIPoma (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide) is a rare pancreatic endocrine tumor. Patients may present with profuse watery diarrhea and hypokalemia. Most are malignant and 60–80% have liver metastases at diagnosis. 

•	 
Somatostatinoma is very rare. Patients may present with abdominal pain, diarrhea and impaired glucose tolerance. 50–75% of patients have liver or lymph node metastases at diagnosis. 



Systemic diseases that affect the pancreas 
Pancreatic lymphoma 
•	 
B-cell lymphoma is the most common subtype of lymphoma to affect the pancreas. There is almost always associated adenopathy and multiorgan involvement by the time the pancreas is involved. 

•	 
The typical imaging appearance is of a homogeneously, diffusely enlarged gland without ductal dilatation, with associated lymphadenopathy. More aggressive types of lymphoma may show heterogeneity/central necrosis. 


von Hippel-Lindau 
•	 
von Hippel-Lindau is an inherited multisystemic disease which confers increased risk of multiple malignancies and leads to formation of cysts in various organs including the pancreas. 

•	 
Pancreatic neoplasms seen in von Hippel-Lindau include serous cystadenoma and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. 


Cystic fi brosis (CF) 

Axial unenhanced CT in a patient with cystic fibrosis shows complete fatty replacement of the pancreas (arrows). 
•	 
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common cause of childhood pancreatic atrophy. 

•	 
CF can cause either fatty atrophy of the pancreas or pancreatic cystosis (diffuse replacement of the pancreas with innumerable cysts). 




Schwachman-Diamond 
•	 
Schwachman-Diamond is a rare inherited disorder characterized by diffuse fatty replacement of the pancreas, resultant pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, neutropenia, and bone dysplasia. 

•	 
Schwachman-Diamond is the second-most common cause of childhood pancreatic atrophy. 


Obesity and exogenous steroid use 
•	 Both obesity and steroids can cause fatty atrophy of the pancreas. 

Miscellaneous pancreatic lesions 
Intrapancreatic accessory spleen 

In-phase MRI DWI ADC 

Arterial phase T1-weighted Portal venous phase T1-weighted T2-weighted 
Axial MRI images show a T1 hypointense, mildly T2 hyperintense mass in the pancreatic tail (arrows) that completely follows splenic signal intensity on all sequences, consistent with intrapancreatic accessory spleen. 
•	 Intrapancreatic accessory spleen is a benign mimic of a hypervascular pancreatic neoplasm. 

Intrapancreatic accessory spleen (continued) 
•	 
On imaging, an intrapancreatic spleen typically is a small (1–3 cm), well-defined mass usually found in the pancreatic tail. It follows the density, signal intensity, and enhancement of the spleen on all CT and MRI sequences. 

•	 
MRI is usually diagnostic. Either technetium-99m sulfur colloid or technetium-99m damaged-RBC scintigraphy can confirm the diagnosis in ambiguous cases.
