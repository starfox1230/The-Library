Esophagus 
Anatomy 
Pharynx 
•	 
Nasopharynx: Extends from the base of the skull to the soft palate. 

•	 
Oropharynx: Located behind the mouth and extends from the uvula to the hyoid bone. 

•	 
Hypopharynx: Extends from the hyoid bone to the cricopharyngeus muscle, which is located at the lower end of the cricoid cartilage, usually between C5–6. 


Esophagus 
•	 
The cricopharyngeus muscle is the upper esophageal sphincter and demarcates the transition between the hypopharynx superiorly and the cervical esophagus. 

•	 
The esophagus extends from the neck to the gastroesophageal junction. The distal esophagus passes through the diaphragmatic hiatus at approximately T10. 

•	 
The three anatomic rings of the distal esophagus are the A (muscular), B (mucosal), and C (diaphragmatic impression) rings.

Imaging the esophagus 
Overview of esophageal imaging 
•	 
The primary imaging modality for evaluating the esophagus is fluoroscopy, which allows for anatomic and function evaluation. 

•	 
A double-contrast esophagram utilizes barium and gas-forming crystals to simultaneously distend the esophagus and coat the mucosa with radiopaque contrast. The dynamic nature of the study also allows for evaluation of reflux and motility disorders. 

•	 
A single-contrast esophagram may be used when you are evaluating for a post-operative leak (performed with water-soluble contrast rather than barium) or if a patient cannot tolerate the gas-forming crystals. 



Overview of esophageal imaging (continued) 
•	 
Barium is the contrast agent of choice unless there is concern for an esophageal leak, in that case water-soluble contrast is preferred. If the patient has a significant aspiration risk, however, high osmolality water-soluble contrast should be avoided (due to risk of pneumonitis). 

•	 
If an esophageal malignancy has been diagnosed, PET/CT may be used to stage for locoregional lymph nodes and metastatic disease, and endoscopic ultrasound is utilized for evaluating the depth of the lesion (T stage) and the presence of local lymph nodes. 

•	 
CT and MRI have a limited role in evaluation of primary esophageal pathology. 




Esophageal rings and webs 
Esophageal web 
•	 An esophageal web is a thin anterior infolding/indentation, usually occurring in the anterior cervical esophagus, which is often asymptomatic but may be a cause of dysphagia if it significantly narrows the lumen. There is a controversial association with anemia (Plummer-Vinson syndrome) and carcinoma of the upper esophagus. 
Schatzki ring 
•	 A Schatzki ring is a focal pathologic narrowing of the B (mucosal) ring of the distal esophagus less than 13 mm causing intermittent dysphagia. 
Asymptomatic narrowing of the B ring is referred to as a lower esophageal ring. 
•	 The key imaging feature is focal, thin, circumferential constriction near the GE junction, almost always associated with a hiatal hernia, best seen in the RAO/ prone position. An upper GI study is more sensitive than endoscopy for diagnosis. 
On an esophagram or an upper GI study, most symptomatic rings do not allow passage of a 13 mm barium tablet. 
•	 The differential of circumferential esophageal constriction includes: Focal stricture. Muscular esophageal ring above the GE junction (also known as an A ring). Esophageal cancer (associated with irregular mucosal contour and an apple-core appearance). 
Esophageal web (rarely circumferential, usually in cervical esophagus). 



Esophagitis 

Reflux (peptic) esophagitis 
•	 
Reflux (peptic) esophagitis is caused by gastroesophageal reflux leading to the exposure of the esophageal mucosa to acidic gastric secretions, which may lead to distal ulcerations and eventual stricture as well as the development of Barrett’s esophagus. 

•	 
Peptic esophagitis is most commonly caused by an incompetent lower esophageal sphincter but may also be 


seen in: 
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, due to increased acid production. 
Scleroderma, due to gastroesophageal sphincter fibrosis and resultant incompetence. 
•	 Fluoroscopic findings of reflux esophagitis are usually seen in the distal esophagus and are best demonstrated on double-contrast images. These findings include: 
Mucosal granularity. 
Thickened folds. 
Erosions (may be solitary or multiple, typically on posterior wall). Thickened esophageal folds in reflux 
Strictures. esophagitis. 
Barrett's esophagus 
•	 
An important long-term sequela of peptic esophagitis is Barrett’s esophagus, which is metaplasia of normal squamous epithelium to gastric-type adenomatous mucosa. Barrett’s esophagus is a precursor lesion to esophageal adenocarcinoma. 

•	 
Nearly 10% of patients with reflux esophagitis may have some adenomatous metaplasia. 

•	 
On double-contrast fluoroscopy, Barrett’s esophagus demonstrates a reticular (web-like) mucosal pattern, often with a segmental stricture in the mid-esophagus. 

•	 
Barrett’s esophagus is often associated with esophageal stricture, which is abnormally high in location compared to a peptic stricture. 


Infectious esophagitis

characteristically causes a large, flat, ovoid ulcer. 

Medication esophagitis 
•	 Medication-induced esophagitis occurs secondary to pills being stuck in areas of relative narrowing, classically at level of aortic arch or distal esophagus, resulting in erosions. 
Crohn's esophagitis 
•	 
Crohn’s esophagitis is very rare and is usually seen in the setting of severe disease throughout the small bowel and colon. 

•	 
Aphthous ulcers (discrete ulcers surrounded by mounds of edema) may become confluent. 


Eosinophilic esophagitis 
•	 
Eosinophilic esophagitis is an idiopathic inflammatory disorder characterized by activation of eosinophils within the wall of the esophagus leading to strictures, webs, and spasm. This often presents with food impaction. 

•	 
The appearance is of concentric mucosal ring-like strictures. 


Chemotherapy-associated mucositis 
•	 
Certain chemotherapy agents can cause oropharyngeal mucositis, which may extend to the esophagus. This can lead to severe odynodysphagia, subsequent dehydration and malnutrition. 

•	 
While the condition is usually self-limited, it can last weeks to months. 




 Esophageal strictures 
Peptic stricture 
•	 
As previously discussed, a peptic stricture is secondary to chronic reflux. 

•	 
Peptic strictures are located distally, usually just above GE junction, and may be focal or involve a longer segment of the esophagus. Fibrosis can cause esophageal shortening, leading to a hiatal hernia as the stomach is pulled into the thorax. 


Barrett's esophagus stricture 
•	 A Barrett’s stricture typically occurs in the mid-esophagus above the metaplastic adenomatous transition because adenomatous tissue is acid-resistant and therefore unaffected by gastric secretions. 
Malignant stricture (due to esophageal carcinoma) 

Barium swallow (left image) demonstrates abrupt narrowing (arrows) of the distal esophagus with subtle mucosal irregularity. Sagittal CT (right image) shows mass-like soft tissue thickening in the same region. 
•	 The key imaging finding is irregular narrowing with shouldered margins (apple-core appearance). 

Caustic stricture / nasogastric tube stricture 
•	 
Both caustic strictures and strictures secondary to nasogastric tube placement are typically long, smooth, and narrow. 

•	 
Strictures develop 1–3 months after the causative event. 

•	 
Caustic strictures are associated with an increased risk of cancer with a long lag time of up to 20 years after the initial insult. Caustic strictures are usually longer than peptic strictures. 



Radiation stricture 
•	 
Like caustic strictures, radiation strictures are long, smooth and narrow and occur in the radiation field. 

•	 
It generally requires more than 50 Gy of radiation to cause an esophageal stricture. 

•	 
Acute radiation esophagitis occurs 1–4 weeks after radiation therapy. Radiation strictures develop later, about 4–8 months after radiation. 


Extrinsic compression from mediastinal adenopathy 
•	 Cross-sectional imaging with CT or MRI is best to evaluate if extrinsic compression is suspected. 


Evaluation of esophageal masses 
•	 
Masses arising from the mucosa, submucosa, and extrinsic to the esophagus produce characteristic effects on the esophagus, which are usually able to be seen on imaging. 

•	 
Lesions arising from the mucosa create an acute angle relative to the adjacent wall, whereas the submucosal lesions create an obtuse angle as demonstrated below. 




Benign esophageal masses 
Mesenchymal tumor 
•	 
Benign mesenchymal tumors are the most common submucosal esophageal tumors and include leiomyoma, lipoma, hemangioma, and others. Leiomyomas are the most common. On a barium swallow, a mesenchymal tumor typically appears as smooth, round, submucosal filling defect. 

•	 
Compared to esophageal leiomyomas, esophageal gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are rare and may be benign or malignant. In contrast, GISTs are more common than leiomyomas in the stomach. 



Adenoma 
•	 An esophageal adenoma is a benign mucosal lesion with malignant potential, usually arising within Barrett’s esophagus and appears as a filling defect (most <1.5 cm in size) with acute margins on esophagram. 

Fibrovascular polyp 
•	 
A fibrovascular polyp is a pedunculated mass composed of mesenchymal elements with a significant fatty component. In contrast to an esophageal adenoma, there is no malignant potential. 

•	 
Fibrovascular polyps usually occur in the cervical esophagus where they gradually elongate. Clinical presentation can be dramatic with regurgitation of a fleshy mass. 

•	 
CT is usually diagnostic demonstrating an intralesional fatty component. 


Inflammatory polyp 
•	 An inflammatory polyp is a non-neoplastic, enlarged gastric mucosal fold that protrudes up into the lower esophagus. Inflammatory polyps are almost always associated with reflux and must be contiguous with a gastric fold. 
Varices 

Barium esophagram (left image) demonstrates oblique extrinsic impression along the left anterolateral distal esophagus (red arrow). Coronal contrast-enhanced CT (right image) demonstrates extensive bulky esophageal varices. Note this patient also has cirrhotic liver with ascites, presumably the etiology of portal hypertension. 
•	 
Varices can usually be distinguished from a solid mass on fluoroscopy since varices change in size and shape with peristalsis and Valsalva maneuver. However, thrombosed varices may mimic a tumor. 

•	 
Uphill varices are most common, due to portal hypertension, affecting the distal esophagus. 


Blood flows “uphill” from the portal vein . left gastric (coronary vein) . periesophageal venous plexus • azygos/hemiazygos collaterals . SVC. 
•	 Downhill varices are less common, due to superior vena cava obstruction, usually affecting the proximal esophagus. 
Enlarged collateral vessels include the supreme intercostal veins (drain the first intercostal space), bronchial veins, and inferior thyroidal veins. 
Foregut duplication cysts 
•	 
Esophageal duplication cysts are lined with squamous epithelium, have a smooth muscle wall, and are usually in the posterior mediastinum. They may be either extrinsic to the esophagus or submucosal; the latter is impossible to differentiate from a leiomyoma by esophagram. 

•	 
Bronchogenic cysts are lined by respiratory epithelium and are usually in the middle mediastinum. They are generally indistinguishable from an esophageal duplication cyst on esophagram and CT. 

•	 
Neurenteric cysts are associated with vertebral body anomalies. 



Esophageal foreign body 
•	 
A radiopaque esophageal foreign body is best visualized with a lateral radiograph or CT. 

•	 
Bony foreign objects usually get stuck in the cervical esophagus. 

•	 
Meat impaction usually occurs at the gastroesophageal junction. There is a risk of esophageal perforation from transmural ischemia if the food bolus is impacted for >24 hours. Most cases of food bolus impaction are treated with endoscopic removal of the impacted food. 




Malignant esophageal masses 
Esophageal carcinoma

Contrast-enhanced axial CT (right image) shows irregular thickening of the esophagus (arrows). 
Case courtesy of Cheryl Sadow, MD, Brigham and Women's Hospital 
•	 Esophageal carcinoma has a broad range of appearances. Early esophageal cancer may be apparent on barium swallow as a plaque-like lesion, polypoid lesion, or focal irregularity of the esophageal wall. A classic appearance of advanced esophageal carcinoma is a mass causing a stricture with a “shouldered” edge and irregular contour (apple-core appearance). 
The uncommon varicoid appearance can be confused with varices, but the tumor does not change shape with peristaltic waves as varices typically do. 
•	 
Esophageal carcinoma may be squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or adenocarcinoma. These cannot be reliably differentiated by imaging, although SCC tends to involve the upper or mid-esophagus and adenocarcinoma typically involves the distal esophagus and may extend into the stomach. 

•	 
SCC is most commonly due to smoking and alcohol. Less common risk factors include celiac disease, Plummer-Vinson syndrome, achalasia, and human papilloma virus (more commonly causes laryngeal SCC). 

•	 
Adenocarcinoma usually arises from Barrett’s esophagus and is due to chronic reflux. The incidence has been rising in recent years. 


Metastasis 
•	 
Direct invasion of the esophagus is most commonly from gastric, lung, or breast primaries. Hematogenous spread is very rare. 

•	 
Most often, mediastinal lymph node metastases will be prominent. The mid-esophagus is most commonly affected due to its proximity to mediastinal lymph nodes. 


Lymphoma 
•	 Esophageal lymphoma is often indistinguishable from primary esophageal cancer. 
Malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors 
•	 Malignant GIST is a submucosal mesenchymal tumor which tends to be bulkier and more irregular than the benign variant. 


Esophageal motility disorders 
Contraction waves 
•	 
A primary contraction wave is a normal, physiologic wave initiated by a swallow. 

•	 
A secondary contraction wave is a normal, physiologic wave initiated by a bolus in the esophagus. 

•	 
A tertiary wave is a non-propulsive contraction that does not result in esophageal clearing. Tertiary contractions are seen more commonly in the elderly. 


In the left image, tertiary contractions result in moderate delay of contrast passage during the primary swallow, with subsequent reflux of contrast (right image). 
Achalasia 


Achalasia: Fluoroscopic spot image from an upper GI series (left image) shows a markedly dilated esophagus terminating in a bird’s beak (yellow arrow) at the GE junction, due to failure of the distal esophageal sphincter to relax. Axial non-contrast CT confirms the markedly dilated, debris-filled esophagus (red arrows). 
•	 Achalasia is a motility disorder resulting from the inability of the distal esophagus to relax because of abnormal myenteric ganglia in the Auerbach plexus. Vigorous achalasia is a less severe form of achalasia consisting of repetitive non-propulsive contractions. 

Achalasia (continued) 
•	 
Chagas disease causes a secondary achalasia that is indistinguishable radiographically from primary achalasia. 

•	 
Complications of chronic achalasia include esophageal cancer, which has a lag period of at least 20 years, and candidal infection from stasis. 

•	 
The classic imaging appearance of achalasia is a massively dilated esophagus with a bird’s beak stricture near the gastroesophageal junction. 

•	 
Treatment options include physical disruption of the lower esophageal sphincter by pneumatic dilatation, surgical myotomy (Heller myotomy), or peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM), and pharmacologic interventions such as botulinum toxin injection. 

•	 
Pseudoachalasia is caused by an obstructing gastroesophageal junction cancer mimicking primary achalasia. These can be differentiated on fluoroscopy because in achalasia there is eventual transient relaxation of the narrowing when the patient stands but the fixed obstruction of pseudoachalasia will not relax with standing. 



Scleroderma 
•	 
Scleroderma is a systemic disease involving excess collagen deposition in multiple tissues. 

•	 
The esophagus is involved in 80% of patients with scleroderma, producing lack of peristalsis of the distal 2/3 of the esophagus due to smooth muscle atrophy and fibrosis, which leads to marked esophageal dilation. 

•	 
Secondary candidiasis or aspiration pneumonia can result from prolonged esophageal stasis. 

•	 
The esophageal dilation is often apparent before the typical skin changes of scleroderma become evident.

on barium swallow leading to the descriptive name of corkscrew esophagus. 


Esophageal diverticula 
Types of diverticula 

•	 
Pulsion diverticula are caused by increased esophageal pressure, they usually occur near the GE junction, and comprise nearly all diverticula seen in the United States. 

•	 
Traction diverticula are caused by external traction by mediastinal inflammation adhering to the esophagus with associated lymphadenopathy, usually in the mid-esophagus. They occurred in the past when TB and other infections were more prevalent and are rarely seen today. 


Zenker diverticulum 

Lateral and right anterior oblique barium esophagram images demonstrate contrast filling a blind-ending pouch (arrows) arising posteriorly from the pharyngoesophageal junction at level of C5, in keeping with a Zenker diverticulum. 
•	 
Zenker diverticulum is caused by failure of the cricopharyngeus muscle to relax, leading to elevated hypopharyngeal pressure and resultant outpouching. 

•	 
Symptoms of a Zenker diverticulum include halitosis, aspiration, and regurgitation of undigested food. 

•	 
A Zenker diverticulum is located in the hypopharynx, just above the upper esophageal sphincter (cricopharyngeus muscle) and is posteriorly protruding. The cricopharyngeus muscle is usually hypertrophied. 

•	 
A Zenker diverticulum is best seen on a lateral view. 


Killian-Jamieson (KJ) diverticulum 

Frontal view from a barium esophagram shows a 3 cm Killian-Jamieson diverticulum on the left (arrow). 
•	 
A Killian-Jamieson (KJ) diverticulum is located in the proximal cervical esophagus, at the Killian-Jamieson space, which is an area of weakness below the attachment of the cricopharyngeus muscle. 

•	 
A KJ diverticulum protrudes anterolaterally, best seen on the AP view and is more often bilateral. 

•	 
KJ diverticula are less commonly seen than a Zenker's diverticulum. Both are false diverticula. In contrast to a true diverticulum, a false diverticulum does not involve the muscular or adventitial layers. 



Pseudodiverticulosis 
•	 
Pseudodiverticulosis is the imaging finding of multiple tiny outpouchings into the esophageal lumen caused by dilated submucosal glands from chronic reflux esophagitis. These submucosal glands are analogous to the Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses of the gallbladder. 

•	 
Pseudodiverticulosis is often associated with a smooth stricture in the mid/upper esophagus, which may cause symptoms. 

•	 
Candida is frequently cultured, but infection is not believed to be the causal factor. 




Miscellaneous esophageal disorders 
Feline esophagus 
•	 
Feline esophagus is thought to be a normal variant characterized by multiple thin transverse esophageal folds. 

•	 
There is a controversial association with esophagitis, where the incidence of esophagitis may be increased in the presence of feline esophagus. 

•	 
Compared to eosinophilic esophagitis, the circumferential folds in feline esophagus are thinner.

This patient has an additional aortic branching anomaly, with the left vertebral artery 
(LV) arising directly from the aorta. The right vertebral artery (RV), arising from the aberrant right subclavian, is hypoplastic. The right and left common carotid arteries (RCC and LCC), and left subclavian (LS) are normal. 
Case courtesy Cheryl Sadow, MD, Brigham and Women's Hospital. 
•	 
Aberrant right subclavian artery (with a normal left arch) is seen in approximately 1% of patients and is almost always asymptomatic. The aberrant right subclavian artery travels posterior to the esophagus, where it may rarely produce dysphagia. 

•	 
On an upper GI study, the resultant posterior esophageal indentation is always smooth.
