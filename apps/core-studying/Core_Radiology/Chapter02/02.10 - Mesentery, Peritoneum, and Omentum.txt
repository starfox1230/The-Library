Cronkhite-Canada is a non-inherited disorder (the only polyposis syndrome in this list that is not autosomal dominant) consisting of hamartomatous polyps throughout the GI tract. 

•	 
Cutaneous manifestations include abnormal skin pigmentation, alopecia, and onychodystrophy (malformation of the nails).

Peritoneum 
•	 
The peritoneum is a thin membrane consisting of a single layer of mesothelial cells that are supported by subserosal fat cells, lymphatic cells, and white blood cells. 

•	 
The visceral peritoneum lines the surface of organs, while the parietal peritoneum lines the outer walls of the peritoneal cavity. 

•	 
The most dependent portion of the peritoneal cavity (both supine and upright) is the retro-uterine space (pouch of Douglas) in women and the retrovesical space in men. 


Mesentery 
•	 
There are three true mesenteries, each of which supply a portion of the bowel and connect to the posterior abdominal wall. Each mesentery consists of a network of blood vessels and lymphatics, sandwiched between layers of peritoneum. 

•	 
The three true mesenteries are: 


Small bowel mesentery: Supplies both the jejunum and ileum. Oriented obliquely from the ligament of Treitz in the left upper quadrant to the ileocecal junction in the right lower quadrant. 
Transverse mesocolon: Mesentery to the transverse colon, connecting the posterior transverse colon to the posterior abdominal wall 
Sigmoid mesentery: Mesentery to the sigmoid colon. 
•	 The transverse mesocolon divides the peritoneal cavity into supra-mesocolic and infra­mesocolic compartments, the latter of which is divided into right and left infracolic recesses by the root of the small bowel mesentery. 

Omentum 
•	 The greater and lesser omentum are specialized mesenteries that attach to the stomach. The greater and lesser omentum do not connect to the posterior abdominal wall. 
Greater omentum: Large, drape-like mesentery in the anterior abdomen, which connects the stomach to the anterior aspect of the transverse colon. 
Lesser omentum: Connects stomach to liver. 
Flow of peritoneal fluid 
•	 
Peritoneal fluid is constantly produced, circulated, and finally reabsorbed around the diaphragm, where it eventually drains into the thoracic duct. 

•	 
Peritoneal fluid preferentially travels in certain directions generally from the pelvis into the upper abdomen via the paracolic gutters (right over left) and pools in dependent recesses including the retrouterine (female)/retrovesical (male) recess, along the superior portion of the sigmoid mesocolon, the ileocolic region (root of the small bowel mesentery), the right paracolic gutter and in Morrison’s pouch. As a result, these regions are the most prone to involvement of peritoneal and serosal metastases. Flow is limited anatomically in some locations like the falciform ligament on the right and the phrenicocolic ligament on the left. 





“Misty” mesentery 
Overview of the “misty” mesentery 
•	 
As previously discussed, the abdominal mesenteries are fatty folds covered by peritoneum through which the arterial supply and venous and lymphatic drainage of the bowel run. 

•	 
The mesenteries themselves are not seen on CT because they are made primarily of fat and blend in with intra-abdominal fat. However, the vessels which course through the mesentery are normally seen. 

•	 
Infiltration of the mesentery by fluid, inflammatory cells, tumor, or fibrosis may increase the attenuation of the mesentery and cause the mesenteric vasculature to appear indistinct. These findings are often the first clue to certain pathologies. 



Mesenteric edema 
•	 
Edema of the mesentery may be secondary to either systemic or intra-abdominal etiologies. 

•	 
Systemic causes of edema include congestive heart failure, low protein states, and third-spacing, all of which can lead to diffuse mesenteric edema. 

•	 
Focal mesenteric edema may be secondary to an intra-abdominal vascular cause, such as mesenteric vessel thrombosis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, or IVC obstruction. Abdominal vascular insults may cause bowel ischemia, which manifest on imaging as bowel wall thickening, pneumatosis, or mesenteric venous gas. 

•	 
The most common cause of mesenteric inflammation in the upper abdomen is acute pancreatitis. However, any focal inflammatory process such as appendicitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and diverticulitis may cause local mesenteric inflammation leading to the misty mesentery appearance. 

•	 
Mesenteric panniculitis or sclerosing mesenteritis is a spectrum of idiopathic inflammatory conditions which may cause a diffuse misty mesentery or a mesenteric mass-like lesion with surrounding misty attenuation. This entity is discussed later in the mesenteric mass section. 



Intra-abdominal hemorrhage 
•	 Intra-abdominal hemorrhage tends to be localized to the area surrounding the culprit bleeding vessel unless the bleed is very large. Hemorrhage may be post-procedural, secondary to trauma, or due to anticoagulation. 
Neoplastic infiltration 
•	 
Neoplastic infiltration of the mesentery may cause the misty mesentery. The most common tumor involving the mesentery is non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which typically also causes bulky adenopathy. 

•	 
Mesenteric involvement may be especially apparent after treatment, where the misty mesentery is limited to the portion of the mesentery that contains the treated lymph nodes. 

•	 
Other tumors which may involve the mesentery include carcinoid, pancreatic, colon, breast, GIST, and mesothelioma. 





Mesenteric masses 
Overview of mesenteric masses 
•	 Primary mesenteric tumors are rare, although the mesentery is a relatively common site for metastasis. The differential diagnosis of a mesenteric mass includes: 
Carcinoid. 
Lymphoma. 
Desmoid tumor. 
Metastasis. 
Sclerosing mesenteritis. 
Carcinoid 

Carcinoid metastatic to the mesentery: Coronal (left image) and axial contrast-enhanced CT shows a hyperenhancing mesenteric mass (arrows) that contains a few tiny foci of calcification peripherally. There are numerous linear soft tissue strands radiating from the mass. 
•	 
Gastrointestinal carcinoid is uncommon compared to other GI malignancies but is the most common small bowel tumor. It typically occurs in the distal ileum. 

•	 
Carcinoid usually arises as an intraluminal mass and may spread secondarily to the mesentery either by direct extension or lymphatic spread. Up to 80% of carcinoids spread to the mesentery. 

•	 
A classic imaging appearance of mesenteric involvement is an enhancing soft-tissue mass with radiating linear bands extending into the mesenteric fat. Calcification is common. 


The radiating linear bands do not represent infiltrative tumor but are the result of an intense desmoplastic reaction caused by the release of serotonin by the tumor. 
Desmoid tumor 

Desmoid tumor in a patient with Gardner's syndrome and status post proctocolectomy: Axial (left image) and coronal (right) CT shows a heterogeneous, infiltrative mesenteric mass (arrows) with central cystic component, consistent with a mesenteric desmoid. Note, no colon is seen on these images. 
•	 
Desmoid tumor is a benign, but locally aggressive mass composed of proliferating fibrous tissue. 

•	 
Desmoid may be sporadic or may arise in post-operative and postpartum patients, but mesenteric desmoid tumors are more common in patients with Gardner syndrome (a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis). 

•	 
On CT, most desmoids are isoattenuating to muscle, but large tumors may show central necrosis. A characteristic imaging feature is strands of tissue radiating into the adjacent mesenteric fat, similar to mesenteric carcinoid and sclerosing mesenteritis. 


Sclerosing mesenteritis 
•	 
Sclerosing mesenteritis is a continuum of idiopathic disorders of the mesentery most commonly of the small bowel that can be divided into the three following stages. 

•	 
Mesenteric lipodystrophy is characterized by foamy macrophages replacing the mesenteric fat. Imaging may show subtle increased attenuation of the mesentery. 

•	 
Mesenteric panniculitis represents an infiltrate of immune cells that results in chronic inflammation. Imaging shows increased attenuation of the mesentery, referred to as misty mesentery, often associated with prominent mesenteric lymph nodes (<1 cm in short-axis). The lymph nodes may have a halo of preserved fat in a background of diffuse fat stranding referred to as a fat ring sign. Linear bands of soft tissue representing early fibrosis may be present. 



Mesenteric panniculitis: Axial contrast-enhanced CT shows misty soft tissue attenuation of the small bowel mesentery, with preservation of normal fat density surrounding the mesenteric vessels and mesenteric lymph nodes (fat halo sign) (arrows). 
•	 Retractile mesenteritis is characterized by collagen deposition, fat necrosis and fibrosis leading to tissue retraction of the mesenteric root. CT shows a mass-like area of heterogeneously increased fat attenuation which may displace loops of bowel. Calcifications may be present, especially in any necrotic portions. 
Mesenteric metastases and lymphoma 
•	 
In addition to carcinoid as described above, gastric, ovarian, breast, lung, pancreatic, biliary, colon cancer, and melanoma can metastasize to mesenteric lymph nodes. 

•	 
Mesenteric lymphoma can produce the sandwich sign, where the mesenteric fat and vessels (the sandwich filling) are engulfed on two sides by bulky lymphomatous masses (the bread). 




Omental disease 
Omental carcinomatosis 
•	 The term omental caking describes the replacement of omental fat by tumor and fibrosis. 

Contrast-enhanced CT axial image shows soft tissue thickening of the omentum  (arrows) just beneath the anterior abdominal wall in keeping with biopsy-proven omental carcinomatosis from ovarian primary tumor. 

Omental infarct 
•	 
Omental infarct is a rare cause of acute abdominal pain resulting from vascular compromise to the greater omentum which may be idiopathic, or secondary to recent surgery, trauma or related to omental inflammation. The idiopathic form occurs classically in the RLQ medial to the cecum/ascending colon while the secondary form occurs at the site of the initial insult. 

•	 
CT shows a circumscribed area of fat stranding, usually large (>5 cm), which may be accompanied by swirling of omental vessels and a hyperdense peripheral halo. Ultrasound may show a focal area of increased echogenicity in the omental fat. 




Diffuse peritoneal disease 
Peritoneal carcinomatosis 

Axial and coronal contrast-enhanced CT demonstrate nodular mesenteric fat stranding (right image, yellow arrow), omental carcinomatosis (right image, red arrow) and nodular peritoneal thickening (left image), most prominent along the pelvic peritoneal reflection (blue arrows) consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis. 
•	 
Peritoneal carcinomatosis represents disseminated metastases to the peritoneal surface. It is often associated with omental carcinomatosis and serosal disease of intra-abdominal organs (such as liver, spleen and bowel). 

•	 
Mucinous adenocarcinoma is the most common tumor type to cause peritoneal carcinomatosis, but peritoneal carcinomatosis due to mucinous adenocarcinoma should not be confused with pseudomyxoma peritonei, discussed below. 


Pseudomyxoma peritonei 

Pseudomyxoma peritonei: Axial contrast-enhanced CT through the liver (left image) shows scalloping of the hepatic capsule by low attenuation material (arrows). A lower image through the kidneys shows the lobulated, mucinous peritoneal material exerting mass effect on adjacent bowel loops. A splenic implant is also visible (red arrow).

•	 
Pseudomyxoma peritonei is a low-grade malignancy characterized by copious amounts of mucus in the peritoneal cavity. 

•	 
Pseudomyxoma peritonei is most commonly due to a mucin-producing adenoma or adenocarcinoma of the appendix; however, it can also be seen with other mucinous tumors including ovarian, gallbladder, pancreatic and ovarian. 


Pseudomyxoma peritonei is often associated with an ovarian mass (up to 30% of female patients), but it is thought that these are most often metastatic deposits rather than primary sites. 
•	 
Pseudomyxoma peritonei was previously thought to be produced by a benign appendiceal mucocele, which is now believed to occur much less commonly than originally thought. 

•	 
Tumor deposits tend to spread throughout the entire peritoneal cavity due to intraperitoneal fluid currents. 

•	 
Clinically, pseudomyxoma peritonei presents with recurrent mucinous ascites. 

•	 
CT shows lobular intraperitoneal material that is typically of slightly higher attenuation (5–20 HU) compared to fluid ascites and that may cause mass effect/scalloping of adjacent organs. Occasionally, mucus can be seen in the region of the appendix, but the flow of peritoneal contents tends to spread the mucinous ascites diffusely throughout the peritoneum. 

•	 
Treatment continues to evolve, but the best outcomes are primarily with surgical treatment and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy lavage.
