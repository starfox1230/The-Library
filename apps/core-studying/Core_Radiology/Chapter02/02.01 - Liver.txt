Liver 
Liver anatomy 
•	 
The Couinaud classifi cati on divides the liver into eight segments. Because each segment is self-contained with its own vascular infl ow, outf low, and biliary drainage, an individual segment can be completely resected without disturbing the other segments. 

•	 
Numbering of hepati c segments is clockwise when looking at a frontal/coronal view.

pancreas 
•	 Each hepatic segment features its own: 
Central portal triad made up of a portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile duct, with peripheral venous drainage to the hepatic veins and ultimately the IVC. 
•	 
Mnemonic for remembering the segments: Superior segments, from left to right: 2, 4, 8, 7, 1 (caudate). 2 doubled is 4; 4 doubled is 8; 8 minus 1 is 7. Inferior segments, from left to right: 3, 4, 5, 6. 

•	 
Segments 2, 3, and 4 are in the left lobe of the liver. 

•	 
Segments 5, 6, 7, 8 are in the right lobe of the liver. 

•	 
The left and right main portal veins divide the superior from the inferior segments and continue to branch superiorly and inferiorly before terminating in the center of each segment. 

•	 
The branching of the portal veins is variable. The most common pattern is a bifurcation into right and left main portal veins, with the right main portal vein then branching into anterior and posterior branches. 

•	 
Small hepatic vein tributaries mark the peripheral margins of each segment. 

•	 
The caudate lobe drains directly to the IVC, not into the hepatic veins. For this reason, the caudate lobe is often not affected in early cirrhosis since the direct drainage to the IVC spares the caudate from increased venous pressures due to portal hypertension. This leads to compensatory hypertrophy of the caudate lobe, which is a typical morphologic change of early cirrhosis. 


Similarly, direct venous drainage to the IVC allows the caudate lobe to bypass the increased hepatic venous pressures seen in Budd-Chiari syndrome. Compensatory hypertrophy of the caudate lobe may preserve liver function in these patients. 
•	 The papillary process is a medial projection of the caudate lobe and can be mistaken for lymphadenopathy or even a mass as it may appear separate from the medial process on a single axial slice. 

Imaging of the liver 
Liver CT 
•	 
A “routine” contrast-enhanced abdominal CT is acquired in the portal venous phase of enhancement, obtained 70 seconds following intravenous contrast administration. 

•	 
In the portal venous phase, the portal veins should be fully opacified and contrast should also be seen in the hepatic veins. The liver should be homogeneously enhancing, allowing detection of attenuation alterations and/or morphologic changes of diffuse liver disease, such as hepatic steatosis and cirrhosis. As most metastatic tumors are not hypervascular (with a few notable exceptions, which will be subsequently discussed), liver metastases can also generally be detected on the portal venous phase as hypoattenuating masses. Of note, some breast cancers may rarely be isoattenuating on the portal venous phase and may be more conspicuous on unenhanced CT. 

•	 
Most benign and malignant primary liver masses are hypervascular and thus are most conspicuous in the late arterial phase of enhancement (~45 seconds). If the patient has a known hypervascular primary malignancy, both a late arterial phase and portal venous phase may be obtained for metastatic workup and restaging. If the patient has a suspected primary liver mass (such as hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatocellular carcinoma), a multiphase CT or MRI may be obtained, usually including a noncontrast, arterial phase, portal venous phase and delayed phase. 


Liver MRI 
•	 
Compared to CT, MRI of the liver has superior lesion-to-liver contrast. 

•	 
MRI also does not impart ionizing radiation, allowing for dynamic post-contrast imaging in multiple phases without any penalty in radiation exposure to the patient. In- and out­of-phase gradient imaging allows for detection of intracytoplasmic lipid, which is seen in hepatic steatosis and may be seen within certain masses, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and adenomas. Diffusion-weighted imaging is useful for detection of metastatic lesions. 

•	 
MRI Contrast agents: Extracellular agents pass through the intravascular system and interstitium similarly to CT contrast. 


Gadobutrol (Gadavist) is a commonly used extracellular contrast agent that is 90% excreted through the renal system. Combined extracellular/hepatobiliary agents pass through the intravascular system and interstitium 
similarly to CT contrast, but are partially excreted through the biliary system. Gadoxetic acid disodium (Eovist) is 50% excreted through the biliary system and 50% through the renal system. Indications for use include evaluation for metastatic lesions and focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). 
Hepatobiliary Contrast Agent  Mechanism  Indications  
Gadolinium-based, combined extracellular/ hepatobiliary agents  Gadoxetic acid disodium (Eovist)  Taken up by liver in the delayed phase 50% biliary excretion  Differentiating FNH and adenoma (FNH is iso to hyperintense) Hepatic metastases (uptake excludes a metastasis from nonliver primary)  
Gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance)  Only 5% taken up by the liver, requires 1 hour delay  Now mainly used in pelvic, cardiac and MSK imaging  
Iron oxide-based  Ferumoxides or ferumoxytol  Particles trapped by Kupffer cells and reduce T2 relaxivity, making liver or spleen dark on T2  Adjunct for detection of HCC  

Liver ultrasound 
•	 
Ultrasound of the liver is often used to evaluate patients with abnormal LFTs, as it can identify biliary pathology and diffuse parenchymal processes. Ultrasound is commonly used as a screening tool for HCC in high-risk patients given its relatively low cost and lack of ionizing radiation. Characterization of hepatic masses, however, requires further workup with cross-sectional imaging. 

•	 
Hepatic Doppler ultrasound is a valuable tool for determining abnormal blood flow to, within, or from the liver and can also be utilized to evaluate transplants and TIPS. 



Diffuse parenchymal liver disease 
Hepatic steatosis 
•	 
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease can be divided into steatosis and steatosis with associated inflammatory activity (steatohepatitis). Overall, greater than 25% of the population is afflicted with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and approximately 5% have steatohepatitis. Ultimately, steatohepatitis may progress to cirrhosis. 

•	 
Common patterns of hepatic steatosis include diffuse, focal (commonly seen in the gallbladder fossa and periportal spaces), geographic, and nodular. 

•	 
Ultrasound shows a diffuse increase in hepatic echogenicity relative to the right kidney. Normally, the liver and kidney should have the same echogenicity. Hepatic steatosis also causes increased sound attenuation, leading to poor visualization of deeper structures. 




•	 CT shows decreased attenuation relative to the spleen. On unenhanced CT, the liver should be slightly hyperattenuating relative to the spleen. The traditional teaching is that steatosis is present if the liver attenuates at least 10 Hounsfield units (HU) less than the 
spleen, although new work suggests that even a single HU of relative hypoattenuation compared to the spleen may represent hepatic steatosis. On contrast-enhanced CT, evaluation of hepatic steatosis is less reliable compared to unenhanced CT due 
to different contrast uptake rates of the liver and the spleen. However, the liver is considered diffusely hypoattenuating if it attenuates at least 25 HU less than the spleen in the portal venous phase. 
•	 MRI can determine if steatosis is present and can provide a rough gauge as to its severity. In- and out-of-phase MRI imaging can more accurately quantify the degree of steatosis, although liver biopsy is the gold standard and best evaluates for the presence of steatohepatitis and early fibrotic change. 
Hepatic steatosis (continued) 

Diffuse hepatic steatosis: In- (left image) and out-of-phase (right image) images demonstrate diffuse signal loss of the liver parenchyma on out-of-phase images. When water-protons and fat-protons are present in the same MR voxel, the fat and water signals are summed in the in-phase images and subtracted in the out-of-phase images, leading to decrease in signal (hypointensity). 
Case courtesy Cheryl Sadow, MD, Brigham and Women's Hospital. 
•	 Variations in portal venous supply may cause geographic regions that are affected to a greater or lesser degree by fatty change. Focal fat does not have any mass effect, vessels characteristically run through it, and it tends to occur in the following typical locations and distributions: 
Gallbladder fossa (drained by gallbladder vein). Subcapsular (along the falciform ligament). Periportal. Focal fat may also be nodular and dispersed throughout the liver. 
•	 Ultrasound would demonstrate hyperechoic lesions, which would be hypoattenuating on CT and demonstrate drop in signal intensity on out-of-phase dual-phase GRE on MRI. 


A masslike region in hepatic segment 4 (arrows) demonstrates signal loss on out-of-phase image (top right) relative to in-phase image (top left), and has a vessel coursing through it (not well seen here), consistent with focal fat. 
Grayscale ultrasound (bottom left image) in a different patient shows an echogenic mass (arrow) in the medial left hepatic lobe. This was also found to represent focal fat. 
Hepatic iron overload 
•	 
Regardless of the etiology, the iron-overloaded liver is hypointense on all MRI sequences relative to the paraspinal muscles as an internal control, and there is signal dropout on in-phase images. 

•	 
There are two pathways to excess hepatic iron accumulation, as described below. 

•	 
Primary hemochromatosis is the most common cause of iron overload, due to a genetic defect causing increased iron absorption through the GI tract. Excess iron is deposited in hepatocytes (not the Kupffer cells that make up the intrahepatic 


reticuloendothelial system or RES), pancreas, myocardium, skin, and joints. Excess iron in hepatocytes can cause cirrhosis. Liver and pancreas are markedly T2 hypointense and show signal dropout on in-phase images. The spleen 
and bone marrow are normal since the RES is not involved. Treatment of primary hemochromatosis is phlebotomy. 

Primary hemochromatosis: Axial T2-weighted MRI demonstrates diffuse low T2 signal in the liver and pancreas with associated signal loss on in-phase imaging (not shown). 
•	 Secondary hemochromatosis is usually seen in diseases that cause hemosiderosis, where excess iron accumulates within the RES. This may be due to frequent blood transfusions or defective erythrocytosis. Treatment of hemosiderosis is with iron chelators, not phlebotomy. The RES has a large capacity for iron. Therefore, iron stored in the RES is generally not harmful and the liver is normal in morphology without cirrhosis. However, when the RES becomes overwhelmed with iron, the hepatocytes begin to store the excess. Just as in primary hemochromatosis, hepatocyte iron uptake may lead to cirrhosis. 
MRI imaging of hemosiderosis demonstrates hypointense liver on conventional MRI sequences and signal drop on in-phase images, as in hemochromatosis. Additionally, the spleen and bone marrow will also appear hypointense due to increased iron stores throughout the entire reticuloendothelial system. The pancreas is spared. 
Primary = Pancreas Secondary = Spleen 

In-phase MRI Out-of-phase MRI T2-weighted MRI 
Secondary hemochromatosis: Multisequence MRI shows diffuse low T2 signal in the liver and spleen with associated signal loss on in-phase imaging compared to out-of-phase imaging, consistent with iron deposition from hemosiderosis in this patient with transfusion-dependent anemia. 
GI: 101 
Amyloid 
•	 Abnormal extracellular deposition of amyloid protein in the liver can cause focal or diffuse areas of decreased attenuation on CT imaging. 
Wilson disease 
•	 Wilson disease causes high levels of copper to accumulate in the basal ganglia, cornea, and liver due to an autosomal recessive genetic defect. The liver may be hyperattenuating on CT with multiple nodules, eventually leading to hepatomegaly and cirrhosis. 
Variations in CT attenuation 
•	 Hypoattenuating liver: The liver is generally considered hypoattenuating if it attenuates less than the spleen on an unenhanced CT. 
Fatty liver (hepatic steatosis) is by far the most common cause of a diffusely hypoattenuating liver. Hepatic amyloid is rare and may cause either focal or diffuse hepatic hypoattenuation. 
•	 Hyperattenuating liver: The normal unenhanced attenuation of the liver is 30 to 60 HU. An absolute attenuation greater than 75 HU is considered hyperattenuating. 
Iron overload is by far the most common cause of a hyperattenuating liver. Medications (e.g., amiodarone, gold, and methotrexate). Wilson disease (Copper overload). Glycogen excess. 


Cirrhosis 
Etiology and pathology 
•	 Cirrhosis is the replacement of functioning hepatocytes with dysfunctional fibrotic tissue, caused by repeated cycles of injury and repair. Etiologies include metabolic (alcohol, steatohepatitis, hemochromatosis, or Wilson disease), infectious (chronic hepatitis B or C), or inflammatory (primary biliary cirrhosis or primary sclerosing cholangitis). The hallmarks of cirrhosis are disorganized attempted regeneration in the form of nodules and fibrosis.

Early signs of cirrhosis 
•	 
One of the earliest signs of cirrhosis is expansion of the periportal spaces. Atrophy of the medial segment of the left hepatic lobe in early cirrhosis causes increased fat anterior to the right main portal vein. 

•	 
Enlargement of caudate lobe is a specific sign of cirrhosis. Specifically, a caudate to right lobe size ratio of >0.65 highly suggests cirrhosis. As discussed previously, the caudate drains directly to the IVC, not via the hepatic veins, which is initially protective against cirrhosis. 

•	 
The empty gallbladder fossa sign results when hepatic parenchyma surrounding the gallbladder is replaced with periportal fat. 


Secondary manifestations of cirrhosis 
•	 Portal hypertension causes splenomegaly and formation of portosystemic collaterals/ varices, including recanalization of the paraumbilical vein. Gamna-Gandy bodies are splenic microhemorrhages secondary to portal hypertension. These appear as 
tiny echogenic foci on US, tiny hypo- or hyperattenuating foci on CT, and tiny hypointense foci on in-phase MRI. This is discussed further later in the chapter. 
•	 
Gallbladder wall thickening is due to hypoalbuminemia and resultant edema. 

•	 
Micronodular cirrhosis causes cirrhotic nodules less than 3 mm in size and is usually associated with alcoholism. 


Secondary manifestations of cirrhosis (continued) 
•	 Macronodular cirrhosis features larger nodules (>3 mm) separated by wide scars and fibrous septae. Macronodular cirrhosis is caused by fulminant viral hepatitis which does not uniformly affect the liver. 

Patient 1 (left image): Axial contrast-enhanced CT shows cirrhotic morphology of the liver with large volume ascites and large esophageal varices (arrow). 
Patient 2 (right image): Coronal contrast-enhanced CT shows splenomegaly and small gastric varices (arrows), consistent with sequelae of portal hypertension. 
Imaging of cirrhosis 
•	 The typical appearance of cirrhosis is segmental atrophy and hypertrophy with nodular contour and parenchyma. 

Axial T2-weighted MR images show nodular contour of the liver with hypertrophy of the left lobe, atrophy of the right lobe, widened periportal space (yellow arrow), and right posterior hepatic notch sign (red arrow) in keeping with cirrhosis. This patient had a history of hepatitis C. 
•	 
Ultrasound appearance is a coarse, heterogeneous liver echotexture with a nodular contour. 

•	 
MR elastography is a non-invasive technique in which the patient wears a device resting over their right hepatic lobe which transmits mechanical waves at a fixed frequency, typically 60 Hertz. A phase-contrast pulse sequence with motion-encoding gradients is obtained to measure micron-level tissue deformation in response to the stimulus. Liver stiffness in kPa is measured by drawing ROI on the elastogram images. 

•	 
Sonoelastography is also a non-invasive way to grade the degree of fibrosis in chronic liver disease. Subtypes include shear-wave elastography and strain elastography. 





Malignant hepatic masses 
Pathway to hepatocellular carcinoma 
Regenerative nodule 
Dysplastic nodule with increased size, cellularity, and atypia (blue) 

Focus of HCC (red) in 
the dysplastic nodule Large HCC with poorly di˜erentiated cells (purple) and increased neovascularity 
Small HCC with neovascularity 
•	 
In the setting of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is thought to develop in a sequence from regenerative nodule . dysplastic nodule . HCC. Regenerative and dysplastic nodules cannot be reliably differentiated on imaging. High-grade dysplastic nodules cannot be reliably differentiated from well-differentiated HCC. 

•	 
Regenerative nodule: A regenerative nodule is completely supplied by the portal vein and is not premalignant. A regenerative nodule should not enhance in the arterial phase. Most regenerative nodules show low signal intensity on T2-weighted images, with variable signal intensity 


on T1-weighted images. Rarely, a regenerative nodule may be hyperintense on T1-weighted images due to glycogen deposition. On contrast-enhanced MRI, most regenerative nodules enhance to the same (or slightly less) degree as the 
adjacent hepatic parenchyma. 
•	 Dysplastic nodule: Unlike a regenerative nodule, a dysplastic nodule is premalignant. However, most dysplastic nodules do not demonstrate arterial phase enhancement (unless high grade), since blood supply is still from the portal vein. 
Dysplastic nodules are variable in signal intensity on T1-weighted images. Most dysplastic nodules are 
hypointense on T2-weighted images, although high-grade dysplastic nodules may be T2 hyperintense. Contrast-enhanced MRI shows low-grade dysplastic nodules to be isoenhancing relative to liver and thus indistinguishable from regenerative nodules. High-grade dysplastic nodules can demonstrate arterial enhancement and may be indistinguishable from well-differentiated HCC. 
•	 A siderotic nodule is an iron-rich regenerative or dysplastic nodule. A siderotic nodule is hypointense on T1 and T2*-weighted images (including in-phase GRE images) and hyperattenuating on CT. A siderotic nodule is rarely, if ever, malignant. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 


HCC in a cirrhotic liver: T2-weighted (top left image) and T1-weighted post-contrast late arterial phase (top right image) MRI shows a nodular external contour of the liver, consistent with cirrhosis. There is a T2 hyperintense, hypervascular mass in hepatic segment 2 (arrows), representing HCC. 
Unenhanced CT (left image) shows the mass to be isoattenuating and barely perceptible (arrows). 
Case courtesy Cheryl Sadow, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
•	 
Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary liver tumor. Cirrhosis is the major risk factor for development of HCC, with other risk factors including chronic viral hepatitis (hepatitis B) and fatty liver disease. A hypervascular liver mass in a patient with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis is HCC until proven otherwise. 

•	 
Alpha-feto protein (AFP) is elevated in approximately 75% of cases of HCC. 

•	 
Patients with cirrhosis or chronic viral hepatitis are regularly screened for HCC with serum a-fetoprotein levels and imaging, typically ultrasound or MRI. Ultrasound is not very sensitive to detect small HCC in end-stage cirrhotic livers. The aim is to detect single 


HCC foci measuring less than 20 mm in diameter, characterized by a better prognosis and exhibiting less than 20% risk of hematogenous spread. HCC has a variety of ultrasound appearances – therefore, a mass in a cirrhotic liver is considered HCC 
until proven otherwise. High Doppler flow may be present, especially at the periphery of the mass, due to arteriovenous shunting. 
•	 The classic CT or MRI appearance of HCC is an encapsulated mass that enhances on arterial phase and washes out on portal venous phase with an enhancing capsule. HCC may be difficult to detect on non-contrast or portal venous phase CT. On unenhanced MRI, HCC is characteristically slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted images relative to surrounding liver and may show restricted diffusion. 
The nodule in a nodule appearance describes an enhancing nodule within a dysplastic nodule and represents an early HCC. 
•	 HCC is often locally invasive and tends to invade into the portal and hepatic veins, IVC, and bile ducts. In contrast, cholangiocarcinoma and metastases to the liver are much less likely to do so. 
The portal veins should always be carefully evaluated in the presence of a hepatic mass. Internal Doppler flow or enhancement within a venous clot suggests a tumor-in-vein. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (continued) 
•	 LI-RADS is an imaging reporting and classification system for HCC on CT and MRI which is an indication of the relative risk of HCC ranging from LR-1 (favoring benignity) to LR-5 (favoring malignancy). This is used only in people with risk factors for HCC (chronic hepatitis infections, cirrhosis, but not cirrhosis due to cardiac or vascular etiologies). The 2018 version describes major and ancillary criteria: the major imaging criteria lead to the assignment of the LI-RADS score, while the ancillary findings may be used as tie breakers. 
Major criteria for HCC: 
• 
Arterial enhancement. 

• 
Non-peripheral washout on portal venous and delayed phases. 

• 
Enhancing capsule/pseudocapsule seen in portal venous or delayed phases. 

• 
Threshold growth with diameter increase of >50% in <6 months. 


Ancillary findings favoring HCC include non-enhancing capsule, nodule-in-nodule architecture, mosaic architecture, fat in mass, blood products in mass. 
•	 Treatment options for HCC include partial hepatectomy, orthotopic liver transplantation, radiation therapy, percutaneous ablation, and transcatheter embolization. 
Fibrolamellar HCC 

Fibrolamellar HCC: Axial CT (top left image) shows a heterogeneous lesion corresponding to heterogeneous signal on T2-weighted MRI (top right). DWI (bottom left) and post-contrast (bottom right) images show hypercellular enhancing components within the mass (arrows). 
•	 
Fibrolamellar carcinoma is a rare subtype of HCC that occurs in young patients without cirrhosis. The tumor tends to be large when diagnosed but has a better prognosis than typical HCC. Unlike in conventional HCC, AFP is not elevated. 

•	 
On imaging, fibrolamellar HCC is a large, heterogeneous liver mass. A fibrotic central scar is classic, which is hypointense on T1- and T2-weighted MRI images (in contrast, focal nodular hyperplasia features a T2 hyperintense scar that enhances late). Capsular retraction may be seen in 10%. 

•	 
Unlike HCC, the fibrolamellar subtype does not have a capsule, although there may be a pseudocapsule of peripherally compressed normal hepatic tissue. 


Mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma 
•	 
One of three recognized subtypes of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and usually presents as large and relatively well-defined hepatic mass with lobulated margins and demonstrates delayed/progressive enhancement. 

•	 
They are often associated with peripheral biliary dilatation and although biliary in origin, must be considered in the differential for a hepatic mass. 


Hepatic metastases 
•	 
Metastatic disease to the liver is far more common than primary HCC. 

•	 
Although metastases are supplied by branches of the hepatic artery induced by tumoral angiogenesis, most metastases are hypovascular and best appreciated on portal venous phase (in contrast to HCC, which is hypervascular and best visualized on late arterial phase). 

•	 
On MRI, metastatic lesions tend to be hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Blood products and melanin (seen in melanoma metastases) are T1 hyperintense. 

•	 
Metastases can have a variable ultrasound appearance, although the classic finding is a hypoechoic rim producing a target sign. If an incidental liver mass is seen on ultrasound, further characterization by MRI is recommended. 



Innumerable liver metastasis on ultrasound, initially difficult to see due to technique: Initial scanning with a low-frequency vector probe (left image) demonstrates a coarsened hepatic echotexture without definite mass. This appearance may mimic cirrhosis. When a higher frequency curved probe is used (right image), innumerable target lesions (arrows) become apparent, consistent with innumerable hepatic metastases. 
Case courtesy Julie Ritner, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston. 
•	 
Hypovascular hepatic metastases include: 

•	 
Hypervascular hepatic metastases include (mnemonic = MRCT): 

•	 
Calcified hepatic metastases include: 




Mucinous cancers (including colon, gastric, ovarian). Osteosarcoma. Treated lymphoma. 
Hepatic metastases (continued) 
•	 Cystic hepatic metastases include: 
Ovarian cystadenocarcinoma. Gastrointestinal sarcoma. 
•	 Pseudocirrhosis describes the macronodular liver contour resulting from multiple scirrhous hepatic metastases with capsular retraction, mimicking cirrhosis. Although termed “pseudo”, these patients may have similar physiologic consequences of cirrhosis including portal hypertension. Treated breast cancer is the most common cause of this appearance. 

Pseudocirrhosis due to multiple treated breast cancer metastases: Contrast-enhanced CT shows numerous hypoattenuating hepatic lesions with a markedly nodular external hepatic contour (arrows) that resembles cirrhosis. 
Liver function in this patient remained normal. 
Hepatic lymphoma 

PET/CT demonstrates a single defined low density hepatic lesion (arrow, left image) and more diffuse low density changes of the liver parenchyma with remarkable FDG avidity (right image), in this patient with biopsy proven hepatic lymphoma. 
•	 
Primary hepatic lymphoma is very rare and may present as a single mass or multiple masses. They tend to be infiltrative and preserve hepatic vasculature. 

•	 
Lymphomatous involvement of the liver tends to be secondary to systemic disease, with associated splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. 

•	 
On ultrasound, lymphoma tends to be hypoechoic and may have the target sign typical of metastases. 

•	 
On CT and MRI, lymphoma is hypoenhancing and tends to show restricted diffusion on MRI. 


Post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) 
•	 PTLD appears as a mass with a variable and nonspecific appearance. Therefore, it is important to mention PTLD if a liver mass is seen in a transplant patient. This is discussed further later in the chapter. 
Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma 

Precontrast T1-weighted MRI Post-contrast T1-weighted MRI T2-weighted MRI 
Multisequence MRI shows multiple T1 hypointense, T2 hyperintense hepatic lesions with peripheral target pattern enhancement (arrow), predominant peripheral distribution, and associated capsular retraction (not shown). 
•	 
Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is a rare vascular malignancy that characteristically causes multiple spherical subcapsular masses than can become confluent. The individual masses may have a halo or target appearance. 

•	 
Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is one cause of capsular retraction. As summarized at the end of this section, the differential of capsular retraction includes: 


Mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma. Fibrolamellar HCC (seen in 10% of cases of fibrolamellar HCC). Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Pseudocirrhosis (macronodular liver contour with capsular retraction due to treated metastases). Confluent hepatic fibrosis (wedge-shaped fibrosis that may be seen in cirrhosis). 



Benign liver masses 
Hemangioma 

Early arterial post-contrast T1-weighted MRI Portal venous post-contrast T1-weighted MRI 

Delayed post-contrast T1-weighted MRI T2-weighted MRI 
Hemangioma: Dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (early arterial top left image to delayed bottom left image) shows a segment 8 lesion (yellow arrows) demonstrating peripheral discontinuous nodular enhancement. There is progressively increasing centripetal enhancement towards the center of the lesion on delayed images. The signal intensity of the peripheral enhancement is similar to that of the aorta. 
The hemangioma is hyperintense on the T2-weighted image (bottom right image). 
•	 
Hepatic cavernous hemangioma is the most common benign hepatic neoplasm. It is composed of disorganized endothelial cell-lined pockets of blood vessels, supplied by a peripheral branch of the hepatic artery. 

•	 
Hemangioma is more common in females and uncommon in cirrhosis. When a known hemangioma is sequentially followed in a patient with early cirrhosis, the hemangioma involutes as the liver becomes more cirrhotic. 

•	 
Hemangioma may range in size from <1 cm to >10 cm. Giant hemangiomas tend to have a non-enhancing central area representing cystic degeneration. 

•	 
On CT and MRI, a virtually pathognomonic imaging feature is peripheral discontinuous progressive nodular enhancement. The degree of enhancement should match the blood pool on all images and demonstrate gradual centripetal fill-in on later phases. 

•	 
The noncontrast CT appearance is not helpful, as a hemangioma appears as a nonspecific hypoattenuating liver mass. 

•	 
On MRI, hemangiomas are typically T2 hyperintense and become even more hyperintense on T2-fat saturated images compared to conventional T2-weighted images. 


Hemangioma (continued) 
•	 The classic ultrasound appearance is a circumscribed, homogeneously echogenic mass with no flow on color Doppler. Posterior acoustic enhancement may be present. If a solitary, classic-appearing hemangioma is seen on ultrasound and the patient has an otherwise normal-appearing liver, normal LFTs, no known malignancy or risk factors for HCC, and is asymptomatic, then no further workup is required. A hypoechoic halo (target sign) should never be seen – this finding suggests malignancy. Ultrasound appearance of hemangioma can be confusing in a patient with underlying fatty liver and may appear relatively hypoechoic compared to the background of echogenic fatty liver. 
Any heterogeneity or atypical ultrasound findings should prompt consideration of an alternative diagnosis such as hyperechoic HCC or metastatic disease (even in the absence of a halo). In a patient with cirrhosis or any known primary malignancy, further workup (MRI or CT) is usually warranted.

Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) 
•	 
Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is a hamartoma consisting of disorganized liver tissue with no malignant potential. 

•	 
It is more common in women and is not associated with oral contraceptives. 

•	 
FNH is called a stealth lesion because it resembles background liver parenchyma on all modalities, except arterial phase imaging due to vascular supply. 

•	 
Approximately 15% of FNH have a characteristic central scar consisting of biliary ductules and venules which does not contain fibrotic tissue and therefore is not a true scar. 

•	 
FNH does not have a capsule. 

•	 
MRI with Eovist contrast is the most useful imaging modality to diagnose FNH. FNH typically is isointense to liver on all MRI sequences, except it is arterially hyperenhancing and will show retained Eovist enhancement iso- or hyper-intense relative to liver in the hepatobiliary phase (20 minutes after contrast administration) due to the presence of hepatocytes and biliary ductules. The central scar will show delayed enhancement with extracellular contrast agents (such as Gadavist), but will not enhance with Eovist.

T1-weighted fat-saturated MRI T2-weighted MRI 

Late arterial post-contrast T1-weighted fat-sat MRI 

Portal venous post-contrast T1-weighted fat-sat MRI 
Focal nodular hyperplasia: T1-weighted MRI shows a barely perceptible mass in the right liver (yellow arrows) with a central low intensity scar (red arrow). 
The mass is T2 isointense with the subtle suggestion of T2 hyperintense central scar (red arrow). 
Arterial phase of enhancement shows avid enhancement with non-enhancement of the scar. 
The mass washes out immediately on portal venous phase, with no change in intensity of the scar. 
Delayed T1-weighted image shows late enhancement of the central scar (red arrow).

•	 
FNH can be difficult to see on noncontrast or portal venous phase CT as it typically matches the parenchymal attenuation. On a multiphase contrast-enhanced CT, there will be bright and homogeneous arterial enhancement with the exception of the central scar, and the portal venous phase will often show only the unenhanced scar, which enhances late (~5 minutes). 

•	 
Ultrasound findings are nonspecific. The central scar is rarely seen on ultrasound, and even when it is, this finding can be seen in other lesions, including HCC, giant hemangioma, or adenoma. Doppler findings of FNH include a spoke-wheel configuration of arterial vessels. 

•	 
Kupffer cells and bile ductules are both present so nuclear medicine studies can be utilized to confirm the diagnosis. Kupffer cells may be confirmed by a sulfur colloid study (1/3 of the time) and bile duct cells can be visualized on a HIDA scan. 


Hepatic adenoma 

Coronal portal venous phase contrast-enhanced CT demonstrates a heterogeneously enhancing hypoattenuating mass (arrows) in the liver, which is a nonspecific appearance. 

In- (left image) and out-of-phase (right image) MRI shows a mass in the right lobe of the liver (arrows) that demonstrates signal loss on out-of-phase images, consistent with a lesion containing intracellular lipid. 
Case courtesy Cheryl Sadow, MD, Brigham and Women's Hospital. 
•	 Hepatic adenoma is a benign hepatic neoplasm containing hepatocytes, scattered Kupffer cells, and no bile ducts. The absence of bile ducts makes a nuclear medicine HIDA scan a useful test to distinguish between focal 
nodular hyperplasia (which contains bile ducts and would be positive on HIDA) verses a hepatic adenoma, which does not contain bile ducts and will show a paucity of uptake on HIDA. 
•	 
Adenomas are much more common in females, especially with prolonged oral contraceptive use. When seen in males, adenoma may be associated with anabolic steroid use. Other associations include collagen vascular disease and type I glycogen storage disease (von Gierke’s disease). 

•	 
There are four histologic subtypes with varied imaging findings. 


Inflammatory: Most common, has the highest bleeding risk. 
HNF-alpha 1 mutated: Second most common, characterized by multiple adenomas, associated with FAP and von Gierke’s. Beta-catenin mutated: Least common, seen in men on anabolic steroids, has the highest risk of 
malignant transformation. Unclassified. 
Hepatic adenoma (continued) 
•	 
Adenomas have a relatively high risk of hemorrhage, which is often the presenting symptom. For this reason, incidentally discovered adenomas >5 cm are usually resected. 

•	 
Adenomas are supplied by the hepatic artery and thus tend to be hypervascular on arterial phase. Some subtypes (inflammatory) may demonstrate intralesional fat which on MRI will demonstrate T1 hyperintensity and signal loss on out-of-phase images. Adenomas may be difficult to differentiate from other hypervascular liver lesions in the absence of fat or hemorrhage. 

•	 
As stated above, each subtype has slightly different imaging features, making confident imaging diagnosis somewhat difficult and often requiring tissue sampling for confirmation. Adenomas are typically circumscribed masses with arterial hyperenhancement, becoming iso- or hypo- 


to liver on portal venous and delayed phase imaging. They may appear heterogeneous due to fat or hemorrhagic content. A fibrous pseudocapsule may be present, which tends to enhance late. 
•	 
There are no specific ultrasound features to distinguish an adenoma from other hepatic masses. An adenoma may be hyperechoic, isoechoic, or hypoechoic relative to normal liver. 

•	 
Nuclear medicine is not usually helpful to differentiate adenoma from other liver masses. Adenomas are usually photopenic on Tc-99m sulfur colloid scintigraphy (in contrast to FNH), but not always. There is usually lack of uptake on a HIDA scan due to the absence of biliary ductules. 


Other fat-containing hepatic lesions 
•	 In addition to adenomas, other fat-containing lesions in the liver include lipoma (very rare), angiomyolipoma, and pseudolipoma of the Glisson’s capsule. 
Biliary cystadenoma/cystadenocarcinoma 
•	 
Biliary cystadenoma is a benign cystic mass lined with biliary-type epithelium. 

•	 
Although benign, most are surgically resected since malignant transformation to cystadenocarcinoma may occur. 

•	 
These typically appear as a multiseptated cystic mass on all imaging modalities. Cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma are not easily differentiated on imaging. Mural nodules should be regarded with suspicion for malignant transformation to cystadenocarcinoma. 

•	 
This is further discussed under “Biliary Neoplasia” later in the chapter.

Hepatic infection 
Viral hepatitis 

Viral hepatitis: Sagittal image of the liver (left image) demonstrates increased echogenicity of the portal triads appearing as numerous echogenic dots (arrows) that produce a starry sky appearance. Sagittal view of the gallbladder in the same patient (right image) shows marked diffuse gallbladder wall thickening (calipers), which is commonly seen in acute hepatitis. 
Case courtesy Julie Ritner, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston. 
•	 
Viral hepatitis is infection of the liver by a hepatotropic virus. Hepatitis B and C cause chronic disease. 

•	 
The most common imaging finding is of a normal liver. When imaging is abnormal, the most common findings are periportal edema (starry sky pattern of increased portal triad echogenicity on ultrasound; fluid on both sides of the portal vein on CT and MRI) and gallbladder wall thickening/edema. 


Pyogenic abscess 

Grayscale ultrasound Unenhanced CT T2-weighted MRI 
Ultrasound (left image) shows a heterogeneously hypoechoic lesion corresponding to a hypodense lesion with foci of gas on noncontrast CT (middle image). This lesion was heterogeneously T2 hyperintense on MRI (right image) with enhancement and restricted diffusion (not shown). 
•	 
Hepatic abscess is most commonly caused by a bowel process and resultant infectious nidus carried through the portal system to the liver. Common causes include diverticulitis, appendicitis, Crohn's disease, and bowel surgery. E. coli is the most common causative organism. 

•	 
Imaging features of hepatic abscess may mimic metastasis, appearing as a ring-enhancing mass on CT and MRI. Reactive perilesional hyperenhancement may be present. On MRI, there is typically also central T2 hyperintensity and restricted diffusion. 


Pyogenic abscess (continued) 
•	 
On ultrasound, infection starts as an ill-defined area of altered echogenicity (phlegmon stage) which evolves into a well-defined hypoechoic structure with internal echoes (mature abscess). 

•	 
Cholangitic abscess can be seen with bacterial cholangitis, or may occur in patients with biliary stents, prior sphincterotomies or hepaticojejunostomies due to gastrointestinal reflux into the biliary tree. 


Tuberculosis (TB) 
•	 
Tuberculosis (TB) causes granulomatous hepatitis, usually secondary to hematogenous spread from primary pulmonary TB. 

•	 
Lesions may be micro- or macronodular (rare), with multiple small hypoechoic hypoenhancing nodules or larger mass-like areas which demonstrate variable enhancement. These findings are often accompanied by hepatosplenomegaly. 


Fungal infection 
•	 Hepatic fungal infections typically show punctate, hypoenhancing microabscesses on CT and MRI and tiny hypoechoic lesions on ultrasound. Lesions are T2 hyperintense and restrict diffusion on MRI. Prior asymptomatic exposure and/or treated disease may show punctate, echogenic calcifications/granulomas. 
Histoplasmosis 
•	 
Histoplasmosis is another form of granulomatous hepatitis secondary to the endemic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum which is most commonly found in the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys. It is more common in immunocompromised patients but can be seen in immunocompetent patients as well. 

•	 
Hepatic involvement is usually secondary to spread from pulmonary histoplasmosis. In addition to the typical imaging findings of fungal infections, hepatosplenomegaly and hypoattenuating lymph nodes may also be seen. 


Pneumocystis jiroveci 
•	 Hepatic Pneumocystis jiroveci is seen in disseminated disease in the severely immunocompromised. Hepatic infection is classically secondary to the use of inhaled pentamidine to treat pulmonary Pneumocystis pneumonia, as pentamidine is not absorbed systemically and thus would not prevent hepatic infection. 
Candidiasis 
•	 Systemic candida infection is almost always seen in immunocompromised patients and may seed the liver (and commonly the spleen as well). 

Noncontrast CT shows innumerable tiny hypoattenuating lesions scattered throughout the liver and spleen (arrows), representing candidal microabscesses in a bone marrow transplant patient with fungemia. 
Echinococcal disease 
•	 Hepatic echinococcosis is caused by ingestion of the eggs of Echinococcus granulosus, which is endemic in the Mediterranean basin and associated with sheep-raising. Echinococcal eggs can develop into hydatid cysts. 

Hepatic echinococcus: Ultrasound (left image) shows a complex, primarily hypoechoic mass in the superior aspect of the liver containing a hyperechoic undulating membrane (red arrow). Contrast-enhanced CT (right image) shows a fluid-attenuating cystic mass (yellow arrows) containing an undulating membrane (red arrow). 
Case courtesy Cheryl Sadow, MD, Brigham and Women's Hospital. 
•	 
On CT and MRI, a hydatid cyst is a well-defined hypoenhancing cystic mass featuring a characteristic floating membrane or an associated daughter cyst. Peripheral calcification may be seen on CT. 

•	 
Classic ultrasound appearance is a large liver cyst with numerous peripheral daughter cysts. A highly suggestive finding is the change in position of daughter cysts as the patient is repositioned. The water-lily sign is an undulating membrane within the hydatid cyst. Hydatid sand is a fine sediment caused by separation of the membranes from the endocyst. 

•	 
There is a theoretical risk of anaphylaxis with peritoneal spillage of cyst fluid, although these are often biopsied and drained uneventfully. Medical treatment is albendazole or mebendazole. 


Amebic abscess 
•	 
Amebic abscess is caused by Entamoeba histolytica. A near-universal presenting symptom is pain, seen in 99% of patients. The most common location is near the dome of the right lobe. 

•	 
On imaging, an amebic abscess is indistinguishable from a pyogenic abscess. 

•	 
Antimicrobial therapy is usually sufficient treatment, and drainage is rarely necessary. 



Cystic liver disease 
Imaging simple cysts 
•	 
On all imaging modalities, simple hepatic cysts are characterized by a round or oval, well- circumscribed, thin/nearly imperceptible wall. A few thin septa may be seen. 

•	 
On ultrasound, a simple cyst is anechoic, shows posterior acoustic enhancement, and demonstrates no internal vascularity on Doppler. 

•	 
CT shows homogeneous low attenuation (0–20 HU) and no contrast enhancement. 

•	 
MRI shows low T1, high T2 signal intensity and no contrast enhancement. 


Biliary hamartomas (von Meyenburg complexes) 
•	 
Biliary hamartomas are small, benign cystic lesions which do not communicate with the biliary tree and are caused by embryologic failure of normal bile duct formation. 

•	 
Biliary hamartomas tend to be smaller and more irregularly shaped than simple cysts. 

•	 
Small biliary hamartomas may actually appear echogenic on ultrasound. 


Autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD) 
•	 
40% of patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) have a similar disease process in the liver, called ADPLD. Even in severe disease, hepatic failure is rare. 

•	 
On imaging, there are innumerable non-enhancing simple cysts throughout the liver. 


von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) 
•	 Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome results from mutation in the VHL gene and is characterized by benign and malignant tumors in many organs. Within the liver, there are often innumerable simple cysts.
