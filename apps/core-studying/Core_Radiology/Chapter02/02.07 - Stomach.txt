Hiatal hernias 
Hiatal hernias 
•	 
A hiatal hernia is present when abdominal contents herniate up through the esophageal hiatus into the posterior mediastinum and gastric folds are seen above the diaphragm. There are four types of hiatal hernias, which are managed differently. 

•	 
The Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) 2013 guidelines do not recommend surgery for type I hernia in the absence of reflux disease. However, all symptomatic paraesophageal hiatal hernias (types II–IV) should be repaired, particularly with acute obstructive symptoms or volvulus. 

•	 
Type I – Sliding hiatal hernia (most common). A sliding hiatal hernia is present when the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) slides up into the posterior mediastinum and gastric folds are seen above the diaphragm. 

•	 
Type II – Paraesophageal with GEJ in normal position (least common). A type II hiatal hernia is herniation of the gastric fundus, with a normally positioned GEJ (below diaphragm). 

•	 
Type III – Paraesophageal with GEJ above the diaphragm (second most common). In a type II hiatal hernia, both the GEJ and fundus/body of the stomach protrude into the lower mediastinum. 

•	 
Type IV – Associated with herniation of other organs above the diaphragm. A type IV hiatal hernia is displacement of the stomach and other organs (spleen, pancreas, small bowel, colon) above the diaphragm.

The GE junction (red arrow) remains below the diaphragm, consistent with a type II hiatal hernia. 

Gastric volvulus 
•	 
Gastric volvulus occurs when the stomach twists on its mesentery by at least 180 degrees and results in bowel obstruction or ischemia. The stomach may be partly or entirely above the diaphragm. 

•	 
If the stomach is twisted but without obstruction or ischemia, it is referred to as gastric “rotation.” 

•	 
Organoaxial rotation/volvulus is when the stomach rotates on its long-axis. 

•	 
Mesenteroaxial rotation/volvulus is when the stomach rotates on its short-axis. 

•	 
Most commonly occurs in the setting of a paraesophageal hernia or trauma. 



Gastric volvulus: Axial (left image) and coronal (right image) oral contrast only CT shows mesenteroaxial gastric volvulus with the distal stomach (yellow arrows) located in the chest through a large hiatal hernia. The gastroduodenal junction (red arrow) appears to be cranial to the gastroesophageal junction (blue arrow). Enteric contrast is pooled in the proximal stomach with reflux into the esophagus; no contrast is seen distal to the stomach. 


Thic.ened gastric folds 
•	 
Thickened gastric folds are most commonly due to inflammatory gastritis, which characteristically produces smooth fold thickening. 

•	 
Nodular fold thickening is suggestive of neoplasm, either gastric lymphoma or submucosal carcinoma (which may be primary gastric or metastatic).

Helicobacter pylori gastritis 
•	 Helicobacter pylori is a major cause of gastritis, gastric ulcers, and duodenal ulcers. 
Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) syndrome 
•	 
Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) is gastrin over-production from a gastrinoma, which is a neuroendocrine tumor located in the duodenum or pancreas that has a 50% rate of malignancy. ZE features elevated gastrin level and a paradoxical increase in gastrin after secretin administration. 

•	 
25% of patients with gastrinoma have multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1. MEN-1 consists of parathyroid adenoma, pituitary adenoma, and pancreatic islet cell tumors. 


Eosinophilic gastritis 
•	 Eosinophilic gastritis is characterized by thickened folds in the stomach and small bowel in a patient with a history of atopy. 
Ménétrier disease (hypertrophic gastropathy) 
•	 
Ménétrier disease is a protein-losing enteropathy that is often a diagnosis of exclusion. It usually affects the proximal stomach and is pathologically characterized by replacement of parietal cells by hyperplastic epithelial cells, leading to achlorhydria. 

•	 
Ménétrier disease has a controversial association with gastric carcinoma. 


Crohn's disease 
•	 
The stomach is rarely an isolated site of involvement by Crohn's disease. Usually the distal half of the stomach is affected. 

•	 
Typical imaging features include thickened folds and mural ulcers most commonly affecting the antrum with eventual tubular stenosis of the antrum leading to the characteristic ram’s horn appearance. 


Differential diagnosis of the ram’s horn appearance is sarcoid, Crohn’s disease, and treated ulcer disease. 
Other causes of thickened gastric folds 
•	 Gastric varices (from portal hypertension), sarcoidosis, gastric lymphoma, and submucosal carcinoma are non-inflammatory causes of thickened gastric folds. 




Gastric polyps 
Hyperplastic polyp (inflammatory polyp) 
•	 A hyperplastic polyp, also known as an inflammatory polyp, is a cystic dilation of a gastric gland that develops in response to chronic inflammation, often associated with H. pylori infection. Hyperplastic polyps are almost always benign, with very rare cases of malignant transformation having been reported. 
Fundic gland polyps 

Double-contrast barium study demonstrates a few small, round, well-circumscribed radiolucent filling defects (arrows) within the greater curvature of the stomach, consistent with gastric polyps seen on patient’s prior endoscopy. 

Fundic gland polyps (continued) 
•	 Fundic gland polyps are associated with proton pump inhibitor use, but may also occur in polyposis syndromes such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Fundic gland polyps have a rare malignant potential, which is more common in patients with FAP. 

Adenomatous polyp 
•	 
An adenomatous polyp is a neoplastic polyp with malignant potential. There is an elevated risk of malignant transformation to adenocarcinoma with increased size, villous contour and the presence of cellular dysplasia. There is an association with atrophic gastritis. 

•	 
Adenomatous polyps are usually solitary but may be multiple. 

•	 
They are usually treated with endoscopic biopsy and polypectomy. 



Hamartomatous polyp 
•	 Hamartomatous polyps are benign polyps usually associated with syndromes such as Peutz-Jeghers, juvenile polyposis, and Cronkhite-Canada syndromes. 


Gastric ulcers 
Benign gastric ulcer 
•	 Although less commonly encountered in the modern era of proton pump inhibitors and Helicobacter pylori treatment, benign gastric ulcers tend to have typical imaging findings: 
Radiating gastric folds are smooth and symmetric. Ulcer extends beyond the normal contour of the gastric lumen (deep). The Hampton line represents nonulcerated acid-resistant mucosa surrounding the ulcer crater. Most benign ulcers occur along the lesser curvature of the stomach, although benign ulcers associated 
with aspirin ingestion can occur in the greater curvature and antrum, which are dependent locations. 

Gastric carcinoma 
•	 Gastric carcinoma may present with malignant ulceration, which can usually be distinguished from a benign ulcer by the following features: 
Asymmetric ulcer crater, with surrounding nodular tissue. Abrupt transition between normal gastric wall and surrounding tissue. Ulcer crater does not project beyond the expected location of gastric wall (shallow). The Carman meniscus sign is considered pathognomonic for tumor. It describes the splaying open of a 
large, flat malignant ulcer when compression is applied.

Benign gastric masses 
Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (benign) 

Submucosal GIST: Axial (left image) and coronal (right image) contrast-enhanced CT shows a well-circumscribed, relatively homogeneous mass with a central focus of necrosis (arrows), located in the submucosal posterior wall of the gastric antrum. Incidental cholecystectomy clips are seen on the axial CT.

•	 
Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common submucosal gastric tumor and may be benign or malignant. While GIST may occur anywhere in the GI tract, the stomach is the most common location. The tumor arises from the interstitial cells of Cajal, which are pacemaker cells that drive peristalsis. 

•	 
Risk of malignancy is determined by size and number of mitoses. Regardless of size and number of mitoses, gastric GIST is less likely to be malignant compared to similar-sized GISTs in the duodenum, jejunum/ileum, or rectum. 

•	 
Small gastric GISTs are usually asymptomatic but may be a cause of melena. 

•	 
On imaging, a smooth endoluminal surface is characteristic due to its submucosal location. Larger tumors tend to become exophytic, or less commonly to invade/ulcerate into the mucosa and cause melena. 

•	 
The differential diagnosis of a submucosal gastric mass includes: 



Lipoma 
•	 A lipoma is a benign, submucosal, mesenchymal neoplasm. At fluoroscopy, a gastric lipoma is indistinguishable from a GIST. Fatty attenuation on CT is diagnostic of a lipoma. 
Ectopic pancreatic rest 
•	 
An ectopic pancreatic rest is a focus of heterotopic pancreatic tissue in the gastric submucosa. The ectopic tissue is susceptible to pancreatic diseases, including pancreatitis and carcinoma. 

•	 
On imaging, the classic appearance is an umbilicated submucosal nodule, with the umbilication representing a focus of normal epithelium. The ulceration is not always seen, in which case imaging will show a nonspecific submucosal gastric mass. 




Malignant gastric masses 
Gastric adenocarcinoma 

Gastric adenocarcinoma with hepatic metastases: Axial contrast-enhanced CT (left image) shows a mucosal­based hypoattenuating mass (yellow arrows) along the greater curvature of stomach protruding into the gastric lumen, with likely transmural extension (red arrow). On axial post-contrast T1-weighted MRI (right image) performed at a later time point, the gastric mass demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement. Also present are hypoenhancing hepatic metastases which are less well seen on the prior CT. 
•	 
Gastric adenocarcinoma may present either as a focal mass, malignant ulcer, or diffuse wall thickening (linitis plastica). Gastric cancer is generally caused by chronic inflammation, with specific risk factors including: 

•	 
Lymphatic spread occurs along the lesser curvature . the gastrohepatic ligament and the greater curvature. 

•	 
A Krukenberg tumor is classically described as metastatic spread of gastric carcinoma to the ovary; however, the term has also been used to describe any mucinous metastasis to the ovary. 




Krukenberg tumors of the ovaries from gastric cancer: 
Coronal contrast-enhanced CT shows bilateral adnexal masses (arrows), representing ovarian metastases. Moderate ascites is present.

GIST (malignant) 
•	 Malignant GISTs tend to be larger than benign GISTs, often reaching sizes of >10 cm, with central necrosis. Although the tumor originates in the submucosa, it can be difficult to determine the site of origin of large tumors as they may become very large and exophytic and may ulcerate into the mucosa. 

Lymphoma 

Gastric lymphoma: 
Axial contrast-enhanced CT demonstrates a large, lobular partially necrotic mass (yellow arrows) in the left upper quadrant, that appears to directly communicate with and invade the gastric fundus, with oral contrast seen pooling within the necrotic portions of the lesion (red arrow). The mass also invades the spleen. Biopsy showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. 
•	 
Gastric lymphoma can have a wide variety of presentations. If solitary, lymphoma can mimic gastric carcinoma or a large malignant GIST. To differentiate between lymphoma and gastric carcinoma, the pattern of adenopathy can be helpful. In gastric cancer, adenopathy at or below the level of the renal hila is uncommon, but in lymphoma it occurs in 1/3 of patients. 

•	 
The stomach is a common extranodal site for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 



Metastases 
•	 Metastatic disease to the stomach is rare. Breast, lung, and melanoma are the most common primary malignancies to metastasize to the stomach. 


Overview of common gastric surgeries 
Fundoplication 
•	 
Fundoplication is a form of antireflux surgery used for cases refractory to medical management as well as for treatment of symptomatic hiatal or paraesophageal hernias. 

•	 
Fundoplication involves surgically wrapping the gastric fundus around the distal esophagus, reinforcing the lower esophageal sphincter. Types of fundoplication are listed below: 


Nissen: a 360° wrap, posteriorly. Dor: a 180° wrap, anteriorly. Toupet: a 270° wrap, posteriorly. 
•	 Complications include slippage, disruption and overly tight and long fundoplications which manifest as dysphagia. 

Bariatric surgeries 
•	 
Sleeve gastrectomy is the most common bariatric surgery procedure and involves resecting the greater curvature of the stomach, leaving only a small residual gastric pouch. 

•	 
Gastric banding is surgical placement of an adjustable silicone device around the stomach to reduce the volume of the stomach, with a port placed in the subcutaneous tissues of the abdomen. 




Normal versus slipped gastric band: Left frontal fluoroscopic image shows a normal phi angle of 54o (normal is 4–58o) formed by the gastric band profile and vertical axis of the spine. Right fluoroscopic image shows a slipped band with a phi angle of 87o. 
•	 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is described on the subsequent page. 
Postoperative anatomy of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) 

•	 
In order to evaluate for and accurately describe complications of RYGB surgery, it is important to be familiar with the procedure and normal postsurgical anatomy. 

•	 
A small gastric pouch is created with a volume of approximately 15–30 mL by excluding the distal stomach from the path of food. 

•	 
The Roux limb is created by transecting the jejunum approximately 35–45 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz, then bringing it up to be anastomosed to the gastric pouch via a narrow gastrojejunostomy stoma. 

•	 
The current favored approach for placement of the Roux limb is antecolic (in front of the transverse colon). The Roux limb used to be placed retrocolic, which required the creation of a surgical defect through the transverse mesocolon (mesentery of the transverse colon). A retrocolic Roux limb has a higher risk of a transmesocolic hernia due to the defect in the transverse mesocolon. 


Although the antecolic approach is now more commonly performed, there are many patients who have previously undergone a retrocolic approach. 
•	 
A distal side-to-side jejunojejunostomy is created to connect the pancreaticobiliary limb to the jejunum. 

•	 
The RYGB leads to weight loss both from early satiety (due to small size of the gastric pouch) and malabsorption (due to surgical bypass of the proximal jejunum). 




Complications of Roux-en-Y surgery 
Postoperative leak 
•	 
Postoperative leak is usually diagnosed by 10 days after surgery. 

•	 
An upper GI study with water-soluble contrast is the study of choice if a leak is suspected. 

•	 
Leaks may arise from the gastric pouch or blind-ending jejunal limb. It is rare for a leak to arise from the distal jejunojejunostomy. 


Gastrogastric fi stula 

Single contrast upper GI study in a patient status post Roux-en-Y gastric bypass shows prompt contrast filling of the excluded stomach (yellow arrow) via a gastrogastric fistula at the superior aspect of the gastric suture line (red arrow). 
•	 
A gastrogastric fistula is a communication between the gastric pouch and the excluded stomach, which may be an early or late complication of RYGB. Imaging findings include gas and fluid (or enteric contrast, if given) within the excluded stomach on CT or upper GI study. 

•	 
A gastrogastric fistula may be a cause of inadequate weight loss or recurrent weight gain. 


Small bowel obstruction (SBO) 
•	 Early SBO in the acute postoperative period is most often due to edema or hematoma at the 
gastrojejunostomy or jejunojejunostomy. With a retrocolic Roux limb, edema at the transverse mesocolon defect may also cause obstruction. Treatment is usually conservative, with most cases resolving as the edema and/or hematoma resolves. 
•	 Late presentation of SBO may be due to internal hernia (more common with laparoscopic surgery) or adhesions (more common with open surgery). 
Afferent loop syndrome 
•	 
Intermittent partial or complete mechanical obstruction of the afferent limb is seen in up to 13% of patients both in acute (<7 days postoperative) or chronic (>7 days postoperative) phase. 

•	 
Fluoroscopy would not show this complication, as the afferent limb does not usually opacify with contrast (unless there is reflux from the jejunojejunostomy). CT would show dilated, fluid-filled afferent/pancreaticobiliary limb. 




Internal hernia 
•	 
Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y procedures are associated with a higher rate of internal hernias (seen in 2.5% of laparoscopic procedures) compared to open procedures (0.5%). Internal hernias can be difficult to diagnose, both clinically and by imaging. 

•	 
Internal hernias usually present within two years of bypass and are the most common cause 


of SBO after a laparoscopic Roux-en-Y. Internal hernias may also present as mesenteric and bowel edema without obstruction. 
•	 
Most RYGB-associated internal hernias occur in three characteristic locations. 

•	 
The surgically created defect in the mesentery of the transverse colon is the most common site (the transmesocolic hernia), associated with a retrocolic Roux limb. 

•	 
Less common sites of internal hernia include Peterson’s space (located between the mesentery of the Roux limb and the transverse mesocolon) and the mesenteric defect created by the jejunojejunostomy. 

•	 
Imaging features of internal hernia include swirling of the mesentery, a mushroom shape of the mesentery, and/or the presence of small bowel loops posterior to the superior mesenteric artery. 



Stomal stenosis 
•	 
Narrowing of the gastrojejunostomy stoma may occur in up to 10% of patients, leading to dilation of the gastric pouch and distal esophagus. Stomal stenosis is usually treated with endoscopic dilation. 

•	 
Narrowing of the distal jejunojejunostomy is less common and usually requires surgery. 


Marginal ulcers 
•	 
The jejunal mucosa adjacent to the gastrojejunal anastomosis is susceptible to gastric secretions, which can cause marginal ulcers in up to 3% of patients. 

•	 
A marginal ulcer is diagnosed by upper GI as a thickening and small outpouching of a gastric fold. 

•	 
Treatment is conservative.
