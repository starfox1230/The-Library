• 
An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is defined as an aortic diameter =3 cm. 

• 
AAA is relatively prevalent in older men (seen in up to 5.9% of men by age 80) and less common in women. Rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysm is the thirteenth leading cause of death in older men. Risk factors for development of an AAA include age, male sex, smoking, and family history. 

• 
Similar to measurement of thoracic aortic aneurysms, CT evaluation should include double oblique reformatted images to obtain a true cross-sectional diameter. 

• 
Ultrasound is a principal screening modality for AAA, with a proven mortality benefit in 65–79-year-old men who have ever smoked tobacco. If an aneurysm is present, the diameter is measured in three orthogonal planes. 

• 
Ultrasound screening of high-risk patients is approved by Medicare for patients older than age 65. If an aneurysm is detected on screening, follow-up is recommended: 


Aneurysm <4 cm: Follow-up in 6 months; if no change • annual surveillance. Aneurysm 4–4.5 cm: Follow-up in 6 months; if no change • 6-month surveillance. Aneurysm 5–5.5 cm: Consider surgery. Aneurysm >5.5 cm: Surgery recommended. 

Aortic rupture 
• 
Rupture is a complication of aortic aneurysms and is the most important diagnosis that should be excluded in patients with acute chest or abdominal pain, hypotension, and pulsatile abdominal mass. 

• 
80% of aortic aneurysm rupture occurs in the retroperitoneum, 20% occurs towards the peritoneum, and rarely to the IVC (aorto-caval fistula) or to the bowel (aorto-enteric fistula). 

• 
Risk factors for impending rupture include increased aneurysm size (especially >7 cm), decreased thrombus-to-lumen ratio, and infected aneurysms. 

• 
Classic imaging features of AAA rupture include: 


Retroperitoneal hematoma. Periaortic stranding. Contrast extravasation. 

Abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture, classic features: Noncontrast CT (left image) shows high density retroperitoneal hematoma (arrow). CTA (right image) demonstrates marked periaortic stranding (arrow). 
• Secondary imaging signs of AAA rupture include: 
Draped aorta sign, where the posterior wall of the aorta is not seen distinctly from adjacent structures. Focal discontinuity of intimal calcification or tangential calcium sign. High-attenuating crescent shape. 

Abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture, secondary signs: Noncontrast CT (left image) shows peripheral calcification that becomes disrupted due to aneurysm rupture (middle image, arrow). CTA (right image) shows  peripheral high attenuating crescent shape (arrow). 
• 
CTA should include noncontrast and contrast-enhanced phases, with thin slice (1 mm) acquisition essential for multiplanar reformatting and surgical planning. 

• 
In addition to a size >5.5 cm, repair is recommended when the AAA is expanding at a rapid rate (>5 mm/year) or is symptomatic. 

• 
The mortality of elective open AAA repair is >3%, while the mortality for urgent repair is 19%. A ruptured AAA has a mortality of at least 50%. 

• 
Repair of AAA can be performed with a traditional open or endovascular technique. Endovascular repair is preferred for all patients regardless of surgical risk and is associated with reductions in major morbidity and hospital time. If patients cannot receive endovascular treatment, mostly due to aneurysm shape, then open repair is considered. Long-term outcomes are equivalent between endovascular and open repair, but endovascular repair often requires repeat interventions. 

• 
Complications of endovascular repair of AAA include endoleak, endotension (enlargement of the aneurysm sac), stent migration or limb breakdown, delayed aneurysm rupture, infection, end organ ischemia, and aorto-enteric fistula. 

• 
An endoleak is persistent flow into an excluded aneurysm sac after endovascular treatment with a stent graft. 



Type I endoleak: Inadequate seal of graft 
• Type I endoleak is inadequate graft seal. Type IA is a proximal leak, IB is a distal leak, and IC is an inadequate seal of the sidebranch or limb occluder plug. 
Type IA endoleak: Inadequate proximal seal allows Inadequate proximal seal leads to enhancement blood into the excluded aneurysm sac. in the proximal aneurysm sac (yellow arrow). 

Type II endoleak: Persistent collateral flow to excluded aneurysm 
• Type II endoleak is persistent collateral flow to the excluded aneurysm sac, which typically arises from the lumbar arteries or the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). 
Type II endoleak: Communication from either the Axial image shows focal enhancement in the IMA or a lumbar artery causes blood to flow into excluded aneurysm sac (yellow arrow), with faint the excluded aneurysm sac.      communication (red arrow) leading to the IMA. 



Type III endoleak: Device failure causing leakage 
• Type III endoleak represents device failure causing leakage through graft fabric or segments 
of a modular graft.  
Type III endoleak: Blood enters the excluded aneurysm  Coronal CT demonstrates contrast extravasating

modular aortic graft.  



Type IIIa: At attachment with aortic-aortic or aortic-bifurcated component. Type IIIb: At attachment with bifurcated-iliac limb or iliac limb-iliac limb component. Type IIIc: At attachment with aortic side branch or side branch-side branch component. Type IIId: Graft tear, perforation, or fracture. 

Types IV and V endoleaks 
• Both type IV and type V endoleaks are diagnoses of exclusion as no endoleak can be visualized by imaging although the sac continues to increase in size. 
Type IV endoleak: Type IV endoleak is caused by a Type V endoleak: Also called endotension, type V porous graft and is typically transient and seen intra-endoleak is defined as continued expansion of the procedurally. Type IV endoleak usually resolves within aneurysm without any other endoleak present, one month after withdrawal of anticoagulation. It is thought to be due to an endoleak below the rarely seen with modern grafts. resolution of imaging. 


Aortitis of the abdominal aorta 

Active aortitis: T1-weighted post-contrast fat saturated MRI demonstrates circumferential mural thickening and enhancement of the aortic wall (arrows). 
• 
Aortitis is inflammation of the aorta, which may be either infectious or inflammatory. 

• 
In.ammatory aortitis can be due to Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis, ankylosing spondylitis, polyarteritis nodosa, rheumatoid arthritis, and immune complex disease. Inflammatory aortitis is treated with corticosteroids. 

• 
The acute phase of aortitis will show circumferential mural thickening and enhancement. There may be an associated aneurysm, dissection, or intramural hematoma. In contrast to intramural hematoma, aortitis tends to cause circumferential thickening rather than the eccentric, crescentic thickening of IMH. 

• 
MRI findings of active aortitis include an aortic wall thickness >2 mm and enhancement of the aortic wall. 

• 
Long segmental stenoses and/or aneurysms can arise in the chronic phase. 

• 
Infectious aortitis presents with crescentic shape thickening of the aortic wall with peri­aortic soft-tissue accumulation. A complication of infectious aortitis is the development of a mycotic aneurysm. 


Mycotic aneurysm arises from an infection of the arterial wall, most commonly by Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella species. 

Mycotic aneurysm due to Staphylococcus aureus: Sagittal (left image) and coronal (right image) contrast-enhanced CT shows marked periaortic inflammatory change (red arrows) associated with a saccular aortic aneurysm (yellow arrows). 

Leriche syndrome: Axial CT angiogram (left image) shows no opacification of the aorta (yellow arrow), while there is good opacification of the superior mesenteric artery (red arrow). There is patchy enhancement of the kidneys. Sagittal oblique MIP shows occlusive thrombus of the aorta (yellow arrow). 
• 
Leriche syndrome is occlusive atherosclerotic disease of the distal abdominal aorta, producing the classical quartet of impotence, buttock claudication, absent femoral pulses, and cold lower extremities. 

• 
Over time, extensive collaterals develop from the thoraco-abdominal aorta to the external iliac arteries, most commonly the anterior, middle, and posterior pathways: 


Anterior: Thoracic aorta g internal thoracic artery g superior epigastric artery g inferior epigastric artery g external iliac artery. 
Middle: Abdominal aorta g SMA g IMA g superior rectal artery (terminal branch of IMA) g middle/ inferior rectal arteries (via the path of Winslow) g retrograde through the internal iliac artery anterior division g external iliac artery. 
Posterior: Abdominal aorta g intercostal and lumbar arteries g superior gluteal and iliolumbar arteries (branches of internal iliac artery posterior division) g deep circumflex iliac artery g external iliac artery.
