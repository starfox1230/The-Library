Cystic adventitial disease 
• 
Cystic adventitial disease is a rare cause of distal claudication where one or more mucoid cysts in the adventitia surrounding the popliteal artery leads to luminal compression. 

• 
Clinically, most patients are middle-aged men presenting with claudication. 

• 
MRI is the best diagnostic tool, as the cystic component can be readily identified with typical T2 hyperintensity. T1 signal intensity varies based on the mucoid content. On MRA images there is luminal narrowing and lateral displacement, which is called a scimitar sign. 

• 
Treatment is surgical resection of the cyst or surgical bypass. Cyst aspiration can also be performed, but the cyst almost always recurs. 



Vascular ultrasound 
General principles 
Angle correction 
90° 
75° 
15° 


0° 

• 
The Doppler signal is proportional to cos(.). There is no Doppler shift at 90°. 

• 
All measurements of velocity should be made at a consistent angle (typically 60°). Measurements should never be taken at an angle greater than 60°. 


Overview of peak systolic velocity (PSV) 
• 
Peak systolic velocity (PSV) is usually the most accurate method to evaluate the degree of arterial stenosis. PSV is elevated proximal to and at the site of stenosis. 

• 
PSV may be decreased distal to a hemodynamically significant stenosis. 

• 
The differential diagnosis of increased PSV includes: Downstream (distal) stenosis. Compensatory flow, contralateral to an obstruction or severe stenosis. Physiologic hyperdynamic state in a healthy young patient. 

• 
The differential diagnosis of decreased PSV includes: Upstream (more proximal) stenosis. Poor cardiac pump function. Near-total occlusion.

Carotid artery 
Color and spectral Doppler parameters 

color scale shows red is toward the probe 
(above the baseline) 
waveform above the baseline is toward the probe 
Normal carotid examination: Duplex ultrasound of the right internal carotid artery shows normal spectral waveform. The peak systolic velocity is 124 cm/sec, within the normal range. There is no carotid plaque. 
• 
By convention, for images obtained in the sagittal plane, the patient’s head is on the left side of the image and the feet are on the right. 

• 
In general, ultrasound parameters are optimized so that arteries are red and normal arterial flow is above the baseline. Certain parameters need to be adjusted so that arteries above the heart (which are normally heading towards the head) appear similar to arteries below the heart (which normally are heading towards the feet): 


The color scale can be changed: Colors above the baseline go towards the probe. Spectral Doppler baseline inversion can be changed: Positive waveforms go towards the probe. 

Evaluation of the carotid arteries 
• There are three components to the carotid artery exam: Evaluation of plaque morphology, hemodynamic evaluation, and waveform analysis. 

Plaque morphology 
• 
Plaque morphology is evaluated on grayscale imaging (without Doppler) and is described in terms of absolute percent stenosis. 

• 
<50% cross-sectional area plaque would not be expected to be hemodynamically significant. 

• 
>50% luminal plaque is expected to show elevation in peak systolic velocity. 



Hemodynamic evaluation of stenosis 
• 
Normal peak systolic velocity (PSV) in large arteries is 60–100 cm/sec. 

• 
PSV tends to be elevated at a site of significant stenosis. Per the Society of Radiologists in ultrasound (SRU) criteria, established in 2003: 


>125 cm/sec suggests >50% stenosis. >230 cm/sec suggests >70% stenosis. 
Potential pitfall: An occluded or nearly occluded artery may have no detectable flow. 
• 
In addition to measuring peak systolic velocity, velocities are also measured at the end of diastole: End diastolic velocity of >100 cm/sec suggests >70% stenosis. 

• 
As discussed on the following page, the resistive index incorporates both PSV and EDV. 


Vascular: 585 
• An elevated ratio of internal carotid artery to common carotid artery (ICA/CCA) PSV is a 
useful secondary sign of ICA stenosis. <2 is normal. >2 suggests >50% ICA stenosis. 
>4 suggests >70% ICA stenosis. 
• In high and low flow states, the ICA/CCA ratio is more useful than the absolute PSV. 
Waveform analysis 
• Stenosis downstream (distal) to transducer (outflow lesion): Spectral waveform is high resistance and high velocity in morphology, characterized by decreased diastolic flow. The systolic upstroke is normal and rapid. Spectral broadening and aliasing may be present. 
Spectral broadening describes the widened distribution of RBC velocities due to disruption of laminar flow. Aliasing is an artifact where the highest velocities are shown to have a reversed flow. 
• Stenosis upstream (proximal) to transducer (inflow lesion): Spectral waveform is low resistance and low velocity in morphology, with relatively increased diastolic flow. Systolic upstroke is slowed, producing the tardus et parvus waveform. 
Carotid stenosis 

Severe internal carotid artery stenosis: Spectral waveform of the proximal internal carotid artery (left image) shows spectral broadening and markedly elevated peak systolic velocity of 634 cm/sec, consistent with severe stenosis. The grayscale images also show hypoechoic plaque. Evaluation distal to the stenosis (right image) shows a parvus et tardus waveform and decreased peak systolic velocity. 


Renal artery stenosis 
Renal artery stenosis: Criteria and protocol 
• 
A peak systolic velocity of =180 cm/sec is consistent with renal artery stenosis. Normal aortic and renal artery velocity is 60–100 cm/sec. 

• 
A renal artery to aortic velocity ratio of >3.5 is also consistent with renal artery stenosis. 

• 
Reduced or absent diastolic flow is suggestive of a stenosis distal to the area of interest. 

• 
As with the carotid artery, a tardus et parvus waveform on spectral Doppler is suggestive of a stenosis proximal (upstream) to the transducer, known as an inflow lesion. 

• 
An elevated renal resistive index (>0.7) is nonspecific, but may indicate renal artery stenosis, acute urinary obstruction, or medical renal disease. The resistive index (RI) is calculated as: RI = (PSV – EDV)/PSV 


PSV is peak systolic velocity and EDV is end-diastolic velocity. RI is measured in the segmental arteries of the upper, mid, and lower poles.

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) 
Overview of the deep venous thrombosis (DVT) examination 
• A lower extremity venous ultrasound exam should include venous compression, color and spectral Doppler, and evaluation of venous augmentation and respiratory variation. 
Augmentation is the normal change in waveform when the calf is compressed. Lack of augmentation suggests a distal venous obstruction between the calf and the transducer. Respiratory variation is the normal change in waveform when the patient inspires. Lack of respiratory 
variation suggests a proximal venous obstruction. 
• The popliteal, femoral, proximal deep femoral, and common femoral (including the saphenofemoral junction) veins should be imaged every 2–3 cm with and without compression. 
Venous compression 
• The hallmark sonographic finding of a DVT is a noncompressible vein with or without an intraluminal clot. A partially thrombosed vein may be partially compressible, while a completely thrombosed vein will not be compressible at all. 
Color Doppler 
• 
Color Doppler is almost always used to help localize the veins, but it is not necessary for diagnosing DVT. 

• 
Normal color Doppler flow in a noncompressible vein is suspicious for nonobstructing thrombus. 



Acute versus chronic deep venous thrombosis 
• 
While the diagnosis of DVT is usually straightforward, distinguishing between acute and chronic thrombus can be difficult. Evaluation of the clot’s echogenicity is not a reliable way to determine the acuity of the clot as artifactual echoes within the vein lumen can overlap with the clot. 

• 
Sonographic findings of chronic venous thrombus include clot retraction and poor visualization of the clot, only partial compressibility, irregularly echogenic and thickened vein walls, and prominent collateral veins. 




Aortic disease 
Abdominal aortic aneurysm 
• 
Screening ultrasound is performed for patients aged 65 years or older, or 50 years or older with a positive family history or personal history of aortic or peripheral vascular aneurysm. 

• 
Transverse and longitudinal images of the proximal, mid and distal aorta and common iliac arteries are obtained. 

• 
Color Doppler images and/or spectral Doppler with waveform analysis help to confirm patency, detect presence of intraluminal thrombus, and document endoleaks. 



Transverse grayscale ultrasound of the infrarenal abdominal aorta shows an aortic aneurysm measuring 5.6 cm in diameter (calipers), with extensive mural thrombus (arrows).
