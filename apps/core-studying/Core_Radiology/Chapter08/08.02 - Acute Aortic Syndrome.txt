
Acute aortic syndrome 
Overview o. acute aortic syndrome 
• Acute aortic syndrome represents a clinical spectrum of related diseases that are characterized by damage to at least one component of the aortic wall, and present as severe chest pain. 
Aortic dissection: A defect in the intima where the blood enters and extends to media. Aortic intramural hematoma (IMH): Media defect with vasa-vasorum hemorrhage into the wall. Penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer (PAU): Intimal defect as a result of atherosclerotic lesion. 
• The treatment of acute aortic syndrome depends primarily on the location (ascending versus non-ascending aorta) and is often the same regardless of the underlying etiology. 
Ascending aorta: Treatment is most commonly surgical. Descending aorta: Treatment is most commonly medical (blood pressure control). 
• Imaging of the full aorta is generally required in any acute aortic pathology. 
First-line imaging modality is CT and includes a) noncontrast chest CT and b) ECG-gated CT angiogram (CTA) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. If patient is stable and cannot get CTA, MR angiogram (MRA) can be considered including fast noncontrast 
techniques (e.g., SSFP), and post-contrast MRA of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. 

Aortic dissection 

• The key feature of dissection is a disruption in the intima, which allows high-pressure blood to infiltrate and expand the media. The most common risk factor for aortic dissection is hypertension, but other risk factors include connective tissue disorders (especially Marfan syndrome), cocaine use, aortopathy associated with 
a bicuspid aortic valve, weight lifting, and sudden deceleration injury. Aortic dissection secondary to atherosclerosis is more commonly type B (descending aorta). 
• 
The true lumen is often smaller with outer wall calcifications. 

• 
The false lumen is often the larger lumen and has lower contrast density on arterial phase. The false lumen can become thrombosed, with beak sign and cobweb sign. 

• 
The classification of aortic dissection is the Stanford classification, which divides dissection into types A (ascending aorta) and B (non-ascending aorta). Type A is typically treated surgically, and type B is typically treated medically. 

• 
Stanford B refers to aortic dissection that starts at the aortic arch between the brachiocephalic trunk and left subclavian artery and not involving the ascending aorta proximal to the brachiocephalic trunk. Since these dissections do not result in organ ischemia, they can be treated medically.

Axial gated CTA shows a dissection flap in the ascending aorta (yellow arrow) with normal descending aorta. Moderate hemopericardium is consistent with rupture (red arrows).

  Intramural hematoma (IMH) 

• 
Rupture of vasa vasorum creates crescent-shaped hemorrhage within the media (in cross-sectional view, top right and below left). 

• 
There may be associated aneurysm. 


The intima is always intact. IMH can be thought of as a noncommunicating dissection. 

Intramural hematoma on non-contrast CT: Intramural hematoma on contrast-enhanced Unenhanced CT shows very faint crescent of CT: Contrast-enhanced CT in a different patient hyperdense (50 HU) hemorrhage in the descending shows a crescentic, hyperattenuating (50 HU) rim aorta (arrows). reflecting intramural hematoma (arrows). There is no 
disruption of the aortic lumen. 

• 
Intramural hematoma (IMH) is a variant of dissection where blood collects within the media, without an intimal flap to connect the intramural hematoma with the aortic lumen. IMH is likely due to rupture of the vasa vasorum, small blood vessels that supply the aortic wall. 

• 
Similar to dissection, IMH may be secondary to hypertension or trauma. 

• 
Clinically, IMH can present identically to aortic dissection with acute tearing back pain. The treatment recommendations for IMH are the same as dissection regarding involvement of the ascending versus descending aorta. 

• 
In high-risk patients, unenhanced phase is performed specifically for evaluation of IMH, followed by CTA of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. 

• 
In low-risk patients, CTA of the chest is monitored by the radiologist; if there is wall thickening, noncontrast scan 6+ hours later can evaluate for IMH versus vasculitis. 

• 
The key imaging finding of IMH is a peripheral hyperattenuating (60–70 HU) crescent within the aorta, best seen on noncontrast CT. Displaced intimal calcification is another important imaging feature, and best appreciated on noncontrast phase. 

• 
An ulcerlike projection is focal contrast enhancement extending from the aortic lumen into an IMH via a visible communication (neck >3 mm); it has a poor prognosis. An intramural blood pool also represents focal contrast enhancement within an IMH but has a nearly imperceptible communication to the aortic lumen; its prognosis is unclear.

Penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer (PAU) 





• 
Penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer (PAU) is a focal defect in the intima that occurs at the site of an atherosclerotic plaque. PAU may lead to saccular aneurysm formation. 

• 
In contrast to dissection and IMH, PAU tends to be caused by atherosclerosis rather than hypertension. One of the theories of dissection secondary to atherosclerosis is that it begins as a penetrating ulcer. 

• 
On imaging, PAU appears as contrast-filled outpouching of the aortic wall extending beyond the expected contour of the aortic wall. The primary differential would be a simple ulcerated atherosclerotic plaque, which would not extend 


beyond the expected contour of the aortic wall. Ulcerated atherosclerotic plaque represents chronic atherosclerotic disease and is not an acute aortic syndrome. PAU differs from an ulcerlike projection in that the latter is a consequence of an IMH and therefore is 
usually not visible on initial imaging, and it may occur in patients without atherosclerosis. 
• Multiple ulcers may be present throughout the aorta, and as with all acute aortic pathologies, imaging of the full aorta is recommended if a PAU is seen.
