Osseous landmarks 
• 
Celiac artery: Arises from the aorta at the level of the T12 vertebral body. 

• 
Superior mesenteric artery (SMA): Arises at the level of the T12–L1 disc space. 

• 
Renal arteries: Arise at the level of the L1–L2 disc space. 

• 
Inferior mesenteric artery (IMA): Arises to the left of midline at the level of the L3 vertebral body. 


Celiac axis anatomy 
• 
The anatomy of the celiac axis and abdominal viscera is highly variable. 

• 
Approximately 75% of the time the celiac artery demonstrates normal arterial anatomy with three main branches: The left gastric, the common hepatic, and the splenic artery. 

• 
The left gastric artery may be the source of bleeding in esophageal Mallory-Weiss tear. 

• 
The left gastroepiploic artery arises from the splenic artery and anastomoses with the right gastroepiploic artery along the greater curvature of the stomach. The right gastroepiploic artery arises from the gastroduodenal artery. 

• 
Anatomic variants are described in the “Interventional Radiology” chapter. 


Hepatic arterial anatomy 
• Most commonly (75%), the proper hepatic artery supplies blood to the liver. The proper hepatic artery is the continuation of the common hepatic artery after the takeoff of the gastroduodenal artery. The proper hepatic artery divides into the right and left hepatic arteries. The cystic artery arises from the right hepatic artery to supply the gallbladder. 

branches anastamose with the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) 

Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) 
• 
The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) arises from the anterior aorta at about the level of T12–L1 to supply the distal duodenum, the entire small bowel, and the proximal large bowel from the cecum to the mid-transverse colon. 

• 
The inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery is the first branch of the SMA. The inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery forms collaterals with the celiac artery. 

• 
The middle colic artery arises from the SMA and supplies the transverse colon. The middle colic artery anastomoses with the marginal artery of Drummond. 

• 
The right colic artery courses retroperitoneally, where it supplies the right colon and the hepatic flexure. 

• 
The terminal artery of the SMA is the ileocolic artery, which sends arterial branches to the terminal ileum, cecum, and appendix. 


Inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) 
• 
The inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) originates at the left anterior aspect of the aorta at approximately the level of L3. 

• 
The IMA gives off the left colic artery to supply the descending colon. 

• 
The sigmoid arteries are variable in number. They run in the sigmoid mesocolon to supply the sigmoid. The IMA terminates as the superior rectal (hemorrhoidal) artery to supply the upper rectum. 


External iliac branches 
• 
The inferior epigastric artery anastomoses with the superior epigastric artery. 

• 
The deep circum.ex iliac artery anastomoses with the internal iliac via the iliolumbar artery. 

• 
The femoral artery continues distally to supply the leg.

external iliac artery 
• 
The anterior division of the internal iliac artery supplies most of the pelvic viscera. 

• 
The branches of the anterior division include the inferior/middle rectal artery (anastomoses with the IMA via the pathway of Winslow), the uterine artery, the obturator artery, and the inferior gluteal artery. 

• 
The posterior division of the internal iliac artery supplies the musculature of the pelvic and gluteal regions. 

• 
The branches of the posterior division include the lateral sacral artery, the iliolumbar artery (anastomoses with external iliac via the deep circumflex iliac artery), and the superior gluteal artery. 




Abdominal anastomotic pathways 
Celiac . SMA anastomoses 
• 
The arc of Buhler is an uncommon short-segment direct connection between the celiac artery and the SMA. It is a persistent embryologic remnant and not an acquired collateral pathway. 

• 
The inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery is the first SMA branch. It forms a rich collateral network with the celiac axis about the pancreatic head, called the pancreatic cascade. 

• 
The arc of Barkow (not drawn in diagram below) connects the SMA to the celiac axis via the right and left epiploic arteries. 



SMA . IMA anastomoses 
• 
The marginal artery of Drummond is the major SMA . IMA anastomosis. It lies in the peripheral mesentery of the colon, adjacent to the mesenteric surface of the colon. The marginal artery of Drummond is comprised of branches from the ileocolic, right, middle, and left colic arteries. Normally, the marginal artery of Drummond is small in caliber, but it may become prominent in the setting of IMA or SMA disease. 

• 
The arc of Riolan is an inconstant SMA . IMA anastomosis. The arc of Riolan also runs through the colonic mesentery, but more medial compared to the marginal artery of Drummond. 

• 
The Cannon-Böhm point is the point of transitional blood supply to the colon between the SMA (proximal) and IMA (distal), at the splenic flexure. This watershed zone is susceptible to ischemia in case of systemic arterial insufficiency. 

• 
External iliac • thoracic aorta: The inferior epigastric artery arises from the external iliac artery and anastomoses with the thoracic aorta via the internal mammary artery. 

• 
External iliac • internal iliac: The deep circumflex iliac artery arises from the external iliac artery and anastomoses with the posterior division of the internal iliac artery via the iliolumbar artery. 

• 
Internal iliac • IMA: The inferior/middle rectal arteries arise from the internal iliac artery and anastomose with the IMA via the superior rectal artery. This collateral pathway is the path of Winslow (rectal arcade).

Mesenteric vasculopathy and aneurysms 
Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) 

Polyarteritis nodosa: 
Selective digital substraction angiogram of the superior mesenteric artery shows numerous tiny peripheral aneurysms (arrows).

• 
Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis of small- and medium-sized arteries that causes multiple small visceral aneurysms. P-ANCA is usually elevated. 

• 
PAN typically affects renal, hepatic, and mesenteric end-arterioles. 

• 
PAN is associated with several medical conditions remembered with the mnemonic CLASH (cryoglobulinemia, leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren syndrome, and hepatitis B). 

• 
Treatment of PAN is with steroids, not procedures. 

• 
The differential diagnosis of multiple renal artery aneurysms includes multiple septic emboli, speed kidney (due to chronic methamphetamine abuse), and Ehlers-Danlos. 

• 
The ideal imaging modality is invasive angiography given the size of the multiple microaneurysms. However, recent advances in CTA allow to visualize these small aneurysms in the vessels. 

• 
Regular CT or MRI images can demonstrate focal regions of infarcts in the solid organs. 


Splenic artery aneurysm 
• 
Splenic artery aneurysm is the most common visceral aneurysm. Multiparous females and patients with portal hypertension are at increased risk of developing splenic artery aneurysms. Splenic artery aneurysms have an increased risk of rupture during pregnancy. 

• 
A splenic artery pseudoaneurysm may be the result of trauma or pancreatitis. 

• 
Indications for treatment of a splenic artery aneurysm include presence of symptoms (such as left upper quadrant pain), aneurysm size >2 cm, and prior to expected pregnancy. 

• 
Endovascular coil embolization is the preferred approach. Coils are first placed distal to the aneurysm neck (to exclude retrograde collateral flow), then placed proximally. 



• 
Hepatic artery aneurysm is the second most common visceral aneurysm. 

• 
Embolization of the right hepatic artery distal to the cystic artery (which arises from the right hepatic artery) is preferred, as embolization proximal to the cystic artery increases the risk of ischemic cholecystitis, which may be seen in up to 10% of cases. 


Vascular findings of cirrhosis 
• The classic angiographic finding of liver cirrhosis is corkscrewing of the hepatic artery branches, caused by liver fibrosis. A hypervascular mass in a cirrhotic liver may represent hepatocellular carcinoma. 


Mesenteric ischemia 
Imaging technique 
• 
Mesenteric ischemia is inadequate blood supply to the bowel. It is seen most commonly in the elderly and has multiple causes, including acute arterial embolism, chronic arterial stenosis, venous occlusion, and low-flow states. Mesenteric ischemia could be acute or chronic in etiology, and acute mesenteric ischemia is the most common type. 

• 
CTA is the ideal imaging modality to assess acute or chronic mesenteric ischemia. Multiple 


phases should be acquired for proper diagnosis: Noncontrast – although some studies suggest noncontrast CT is not necessary. Arterial phase – 30-second delay, or achieved with bolus tracking. Delayed or venous phase – 90-second delay. 
• Although MRA has a limited role in acute mesenteric ischemia, it can help to identify proximal vessel abnormalities including stenosis or occlusion in patients with iodinated contrast allergy. 
Acute mesenteric ischemia 

Acute mesenteric ischemia: CTA shows segmental occlusion of the proximal SMA (yellow arrows) with associated severe pneumatosis of the bowel loops (red arrows), mesenteric venous gas (blue arrows) and air in the portal venous system (green arrows), in keeping with end organ ischemia. 
• 
Acute mesenteric ischemia typically presents as catastrophic abdominal pain, often with lactic acidosis. 

• 
Arterial SMA embolism is the most common cause of acute mesenteric ischemia. An SMA embolism distal to the middle colic artery carries the highest high risk of intestinal ischemia, as 


there are few native distal collaterals. The middle colic artery anastomoses with the IMA via the marginal artery of Drummond and the arc of Riolan. 
• 
Acute in situ thrombosis is another cause of mesenteric ischemia that is usually superimposed on existing atherosclerosis. 

• 
Venous thrombosis is a rare cause of acute mesenteric ischemia. 

• 
CTA findings of acute mesenteric ischemia include: Arterial phase images can reveal SMA stenoses, occlusions, and luminal narrowing. Delayed or venous phase can reveal venous obstruction as well as bowel and end organ ischemia, 


including bowel wall necrosis, pneumatosis intestinalis, and perforation. Dual-energy CT reconstructions such as iodine maps and monoenergetic images can help to detect bowel ischemia, where the ischemic segments have lower iodine concentrations. 
• Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) is a highly lethal (70–100% mortality) form of acute mesenteric ischemia. NOMI is known as “intestinal necrosis with a patent arterial tree;” however, mesenteric arteries are diffusely attenuated/small in caliber on CTA due to vasospasm. Bowel ischemia findings are prominent along the watershed areas. In addition, CT hypoperfusion complex (shock bowel syndrome) features can be seen in the abdomen. 

Chronic mesenteric ischemia 
• 
Chronic mesenteric ischemia is usually caused by atherosclerosis. The classic clinical presentation is postprandial abdominal pain out of proportion to the physical exam. 

• 
Because mesenteric collaterals are so extensive, at least two of three mesenteric arteries (celiac, SMA, and IMA) must be diseased to produce symptoms in chronic disease. 

• 
CTA findings include stenosis of the mesenteric vessels, extensive collaterals, bowel wall thickening and pneumatosis. 

• 
Chronic mesenteric ischemia can be treated endovascularly with angioplasty and stenting. 




Arterial compression syndromes 
Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) 
• 
Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is celiac artery compression by the median arcuate ligament, a part of the diaphragmatic crura. Arterial compression worsens with expiration. 

• 
While most patients are asymptomatic, MALS may clinically present with crampy abdominal pain. MALS tends to occur in young, thin women. 

• 
CTA or MRA shows a proximal stenosis of the celiac axis with hook sign configuration, post­stenotic dilatation, and collaterals between branches of the gastroduodenal artery and SMA. 

• 
Dynamic imaging (expiration and inspiration) can be done to assess severity of the stenosis. 

• 
Angioplasty is not effective and stents are controversial due to high risk of device failure. Definitive treatment is surgical release of the median arcuate ligament to enlarge the diaphragmatic hiatus. 

• 
SMA syndrome is compression of the duodenum between the aorta and the SMA, and is also known as Wilkie syndrome. 

• 
SMA syndrome occurs in thin children, burn victims, and patients who have lost weight. 

• 
CTA or MRA can diagnose duodenal compression by SMA. Aortomesenteric angle or 


distance can be measured to assess the degree of stenosis. 
Normal aortomesenteric angle = 28–65 degrees; aortomesenteric distance = 10–34 mm 
In SMA syndrome aortomesenteric angle = 6–22 degrees; aortomesenteric distance = 2–8 mm. 
In addition to the narrowing of the SMA angle, dilation of the first and second part of the duodenum as 
well as stomach are the key elements of the diagnosis. 
• Treatment starts with medical management, and if conservative treatment fails then surgical approach including lysis of the ligament of Treitz or duodenojejunostomy can be done. 


Renal Vessels 
Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis 
• 
Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of renal artery stenosis in older adults. 

• 
Atherosclerosis tends to affect the ostia (origin) of the renal arteries. 

• 
Both CTA and MRA have high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis. However, high sensitivity diagnosis by MRA is applicable only to the proximal segments. 

• 
Angioplasty and stenting have greater long-term patency compared to angioplasty alone. 



Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) 
• 
Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is an idiopathic, non-infectious, non-inflammatory vascular disease affecting primarily the renal and carotid arteries. FMD is bilateral 2/3 of the time. 

• 
FMD is predominantly seen in young or middle-aged women. 

• 
In contrast to the ostial involvement of renal artery atherosclerosis, FMD tends to affect the mid or distal third of the renal arteries. 

• 
The most common form of FMD is the medial fibroplasia subtype (80%), which features the classic string of pearls or string of beads appearance on angiography. 

• 
A less common form is intimal fibroplasia, which is more common in children and appears as a smooth stenosis, not the string of pearls typical of medial fibroplasia. 

• 
Perimedial and adventitial fibroplasia are less common variants. 

• 
Diagnosis workup includes CTA or MRA. Angiography is reserved for treatment. 



• 
A classic imaging feature of FMD is the string of beads sign, caused by alternating stenosis and aneurysmal dilation of the renal artery.  Less common imaging features are focal stenosis (intimal type FMD) or dissection and aneurysm. 

• 
FMD clinically responds well to angioplasty alone, with improved blood pressure control in 97%, including a 42% cure rate and a 90% patency rate at 5 years. 

• 
Stenting of FMD is not recommended, as stenting can complicate retreatment with angioplasty and lead to in-stent stenosis due to intimal hyperplasia.  


Neurofibromatosis 
• 
Neurofibromatosis may cause hypertension in children due to renal artery stenosis. 

• 
Renal artery stenosis from NF1 may be angiographically indistinguishable from Takayasu arteritis, the most common cause of renal artery stenosis in children. 



Renal arteriovenous fistulas and malformations 
• 
Renal arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are anomalous direct communications between arteries and veins in the kidney, and almost always acquired, secondary to trauma or renal biopsy. 

• 
Renal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are rare congenital entities, and similarly there is abnormal connection between arterial and venous vessels. However, AVM almost always has a vascular nidus. 

• 
CTA is an ideal imaging modality to assess AVF or AVM. Classical imaging features are large renal artery, associated aneurysmal dilation at the level of the venous communication, and early opacification of the renal vein during the arterial phase images. 

• 
Similar findings can be seen on MRA. In addition, on T2-weighted images, large, round signal voids can be seen within the kidney.  

• 
Angiography of an AVF shows venous opacification during the arterial phase. 

• 
The majority of renal AVFs are asymptomatic and often heal spontaneously. When symptomatic, hematuria is the most common complaint. Less commonly, a renal AVF can lead to high-output cardiac failure or spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage. 

• 
Treatment of a renal AVF or AVM is with embolization (coils, glue, or alcohol). 





Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeding 
Imaging diagnosis of GI bleed 
• Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding could be upper GI bleeding (~15%) (proximal to the ligament of Treitz) or lower GI bleeding (~85%) (distal to the ligament of Treitz). This chapter focuses on lower GI bleeding as it is far more common. 
Upper GI bleeding presents with hematemesis or melena. Lower GI bleeding presents with hematochezia or melena. 
• 
Etiologies of lower GI bleeding vary based on age. In young adults, common causes are inflammatory bowel disease or Meckel diverticulum. In older patients, common causes include colonic diverticula, angiodysplasia, neoplasm, or hemorrhoids. 

• 
Colonoscopy is the first-line modality for diagnosing lower GI bleeding. However, in certain clinical scenarios, either CTA or technetium-99m-labeled RBC scintigraphy can be performed as alternatives. Both modalities have limited sensitivity since bleeding is often intermittent. The positivity rate of CTA for extravasation is higher if performed within 4 hours or as soon as possible following the last episode of bleeding. 

• 
Rates of bleeding that can be detected by different imaging modalities: Tc-99m-labeled RBC scintigraphy: <0.1 mL/min CTA: 0.3–0.5 mL/min DSA: 0.5–1.0 mL/min 

• 
For detection of GI bleed, CTA and Tc-99m-labeled RBC scintigraphy have comparable sensitivities, although CTA has higher sensitivity to locate the bleeding. Intermittent bleeding is the most common cause of false-negative results on CTA. 

• 
CTA protocol includes three phases: noncontrast, arterial phase, and delayed/venous phase. 

• 
Imaging findings of GI bleed on CTA include: Intraluminal hyperattenuation on noncontrast phase, representing hematoma/clot. Intraluminal extravasation of contrast material is the main criteria to locate the bleeding point. Changing morphology of the extravasated contrast material with time (assessed on delayed images) confirms the diagnosis. 


Diverticular bleed 

Diverticular bleed: Tagged red blood cell scan at 15, 30, and 45 minutes shows abnormal tracer accumulation at the hepatic flexure (arrow) with rapid transit into the distal colon by 45 minutes. 

Noncontrast CT (left image) shows diverticulosis of the right colon (yellow arrow). Contrast-enhanced CT, aortic phase, shows dependent active extravasation of contrast in the region of the diverticulum (red arrow). 
• 
Diverticulosis is the most common cause of lower GI bleeding in older adults. 

• 
Imaging finding on CTA is active bleeding within extensive diverticulosis. 

• 
Most patients respond to conservative management, but angiography can be used for stable or unstable patients who fail medical management. Potential therapies include superselective embolization (most commonly with coils) or vasopressin infusion. 


Angiodysplasia 
• 
Angiodysplasia is an acquired vascular anomaly that is a common cause of chronic intermittent lower GI bleeding, most typically located in the right colon or cecum. Because angiodysplasia is so prevalent (identified in up to 15% of patients incidentally), the presence of angiodysplasia in a bleeding patient should not stop the hunt for other possible sources. 

• 
Even when angiodysplasia is the cause of bleeding, active extravasation is rarely seen. 

• 
On CTA, angiodysplasia displays as small areas of bowel wall enhancement and venous opacification on arterial phase. 

• 
Treatment is endoscopy with electrocoagulation, laser therapy, or other techniques. Surgery can be performed for recurrent or uncontrollable bleeding, but is usually not necessary.

Common iliac veins 

Coronal MIP of MR venogram demonstrates normal appearance of the renal veins, IVC, and common iliac veins. The portal venous system is not portrayed here. MR venogram with contrast is obtained with multiplanar spoiled gradient-echo acquisition, imaged during three breath holds to obtain the arterial, first and second phase delayed imaging. 

Abdominopelvic venous pathologies 
Congenital IVC anomalies 
• Congenital IVC variants include absence, duplication, left-sided location, azygous or hemiazygous continuation, and web formation. 
IVC involvement in neoplasms 
• 
The IVC can be involved in Wilms tumor, leiomyosarcoma, adrenal cortical carcinoma, testicular carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and other neoplasms. 

• 
Primary IVC leiomyosarcoma arises from the parietal muscle cells of the IVC, usually in female patients aged 40–60 years. Imaging features include an enhancing filling defect with cystic necrosis. 


Duplicated IVC 
• 
If a duplicated IVC is present, in order to prevent a clot from circumnavigating the filter, either a single filter is placed above the IVC confluence or a filter is placed in each duplicated IVC. 

• 
If pre-procedural imaging is not available, a clue to the presence of a duplicated IVC on initial cavography is the absence of iliac vein influx contralateral to the side injected. 



Duplicated IVC: Pre-procedure contrast-enhanced CT (left image) shows duplicated IVCs on either side of the aorta (arrows).

IVC imaging pitfalls 
• 
Pseudolipoma is a common mimic of pathology at the level of the diaphragm due to volume-averaging artifact from prominent pericaval fat above the caudate lobe. Pseudolipoma can be prominent in patients with cirrhosis. 

• 
Admixture artifact occurs wherever contrast-enhanced blood mixes with non-opacified blood, for example retrograde flow in the setting of right heart failure, contrast injection faster than 3 mL/sec, and at the level of the renal veins when contrast-enhanced blood from the kidneys mixes with non-opacified blood from the lower extremities. 




Renal Veins 
Nutcracker syndrome 
• 
Nutcracker syndrome is compression of the left renal vein between the aorta and the SMA. This is similar to SMA syndrome, but the renal vein is compressed instead of the duodenum. 

• 
A posterior variant, called posterior nutcracker, is the compression of a retroaortic (or circumaortic) renal vein between the aorta and the vertebral body. 

• 
Nutcracker syndrome can present with variable clinical symptoms including pain, hematuria, orthostatic proteinuria, pelvic congestion, and varicocele (in a male). 

• 
If patient is asymptomatic, this is called Nutcracker phenomenon. 

• 
Ultrasound, CTA or MRA can be utilized to assess the aortic-SMA angle, renal vein stenosis and upstream dilation, prominent collateral pathway particularly through the left gonadal vein. Narrowing of the vein only can be altered based on patient’s intravascular volume status, therefore, other findings should be included in the interpretation. 

• 
Treatment depends on the symptoms. The majority of cases of hematuria resolve within two years of observation. If treatment is desired, angioplasty and stenting of the renal vein can be performed.

RIGHT common iliac ARTERY 
artery against the lumbar vertebrae 
with or without deep venous thrombosis. 
• 
Similar to other venous compression syndromes, intravascular volume status of the patient should be taken into consideration. 

• 
Chronic compression leads to a fibrous adhesion in the vein, predisposing to thrombosis. 

• 
CT venography or MR venography can diagnose compression and associated deep vein thrombosis. 

• 
Treatment is endovascular thrombolysis followed by stenting. 


Varicocele 
• 
A varicocele is dilation of the pampiniform venous plexus. Primary varicocele (most common) is due to absent or incompetent valves in the proximal gonadal vein causing venous reflux. Primary varicoceles are a highly prevalent and treatable cause of infertility. Secondary varicocele is due to a mass obstructing venous return. 

• 
The vast majority of varicoceles are left-sided as the left gonadal vein drains into the left renal vein, while the right gonadal vein drains directly into the IVC. A solitary right varicocele should prompt the workup for an obstructing retroperitoneal mass. 

• 
Scrotal ultrasound shows a dilated (>2 mm) venous plexus with a bag of worms appearance, which worsens on Valsalva maneuver. 

• 
Treatment is coil embolization or surgical ligation of the gonadal vein, which have been shown to be equivalent in outcome. 


Pelvic congestion syndrome 
• 
Pelvic congestion syndrome is a potentially treatable cause of chronic abdominopelvic pain. 

• 
Etiologies include retrograde flow through incompetent valves of the ovarian veins or venous obstruction. 

• 
Imaging shows dilated pelvic and ovarian veins that increase in caliber or reversed flow after Valsalva.
