Lower extremity vessels 
Normal vascular anatomy o. the lower extremity 
Arterial anatomy of the leg 

After passing posteriorly through the adductor hiatus, the SFA becomes the popliteal artery. From medial to lateral, the branches of the popliteal artery are: 
A) Posterior tibial artery (most medial). 
B) Peroneal artery (arises from the tibioperoneal trunk, along with the posterior tibial artery). 
C) Anterior tibial artery (most lateral; the only anterior artery of the lower leg). It is easy to remember that the anterior tibial artery is lateral because the only muscle bulk of the anterior lower leg is the lateral compartment and that muscle is the anterior tibialis. 
• 
The femoral artery is the continuation of external iliac artery distal to the inguinal ligament. 

• 
The femoral artery branches include: Profunda femoral artery, the terminal branch to supply the deep muscles of the thigh. Superficial circumflex iliac artery. 


Superficial femoral artery (SFA), which continues to supply the leg and foot. 
• The superficial venous system is composed of the great and small saphenous veins. The great saphenous vein drains into the common femoral vein. Although the great saphenous vein is technically part of the superficial system, clots near the saphenofemoral junction are typically treated with anticoagulation because of their propensity to become dislodged. 
The small saphenous vein drains into the popliteal vein (which continues proximally as the femoral vein). Clots in the small saphenous vein are typically not treated. 
• Deep venous system anatomy mirrors arterial anatomy: The common femoral vein (CFV) drains into the external iliac vein and begins at 
the level of the inguinal ligament. The CFV lies medial to the common femoral artery. CFV tributaries include the femoral and  
deep femoral veins. The femoral vein was previously called the superficial femoral vein. 
The term super.cial femoral vein should be avoided as it wrongly implies that this vein is part of the superficial venous system. 

The three paired deep calf veins are the anterior tibial (lateral), peroneal (middle), and posterior tibial (medial) veins, which join to form the popliteal vein (PV). The PV continues into the femoral vein. The gastrocnemius and soleal veins are muscular veins also considered part of the deep venous system. 

Distal aorta, iliac, pelvic, and leg arteries pathologies 
Iliac artery aneurysm 
• 
An iliac artery aneurysm is defined as common iliac artery diameter >2.5 cm. Ectasia is defined as >1.7 cm in males and >1.5 cm in females. Repair is recommended once the diameter is >3.0 cm. 

• 
Iliac artery aneurysms are typically seen in older men and are associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms. They are most commonly associated with atherosclerosis. Iliac aneurysms may also be due to connective tissue diseases, such as Marfan syndrome. 

• 
Cross-sectional imaging is recommended if an iliac stenosis is seen first on angiography. An iliac aneurysm with intraluminal thrombus can simulate an atherosclerotic stenosis on angiography. 

• 
CTA or MRA can be done for the diagnosis and treatment planning. 

• 
In appropriate candidates, endovascular stent-graft is the preferred treatment for an iliac artery aneurysm. 

• 
Mass effect from the aneurysm may cause neurologic and urologic symptoms, in which case surgical treatment is recommended. Endovascular aneurysm repair cannot rapidly decrease aneurysm size, although endovascularly treated aneurysms do gradually decrease in size. 



Persistent sciatic artery: Axial CT angiogram (left image) shows an enlarged vessel in the left gluteal region (yellow arrow) between the ischial tuberosity and the gluteus maximus. Two small vessels are present in the left inguinal region (red arrows) instead of a normal common femoral artery. 
Three-dimensional volume-rendered reconstruction from the same study (right image) shows an enlarged left internal iliac artery, which continues distally as the persistent sciatic artery (yellow arrows). This patient also has a left femoral artery, although decreased in caliber (red arrow).

• 
A persistent sciatic artery is a very rare vascular anomaly where the fetal sciatic artery persists to supply the majority of blood supply to the leg. 

• 
The persistent sciatic artery arises from the internal iliac artery (usually from the inferior gluteal artery) and continues distally to the popliteal artery. A rudimentary femoral artery may be present. 

• 
A persistent sciatic artery may predispose to aneurysm formation. 




Thromboembolic and atherosclerotic lower extremity disease 
Chronic arterial occlusive disease 
• 
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) shares risk factors with coronary artery disease, including smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, lack of exercise, and family history. 

• 
Clinically, chronic peripheral atherosclerosis presents initially with claudication, which can progress to ischemic rest pain or tissue loss in severe cases. 

• 
Claudication is usually first treated conservatively, with risk factor control, exercise, aspirin, and/or cilostazol (a platelet-aggregation inhibitor with vasodilator action). 

• 
The most common locations for lower extremity atherosclerotic stenoses include the common iliac arteries, superficial femoral artery, popliteal artery, tibioperoneal trunk, and origins of the tibial arteries. 

• 
The Rutherford classification clinically categorizes chronic limb ischemia. Category 0 is asymptomatic, category 1 is mild claudication, categories 2–3 are moderate to severe ischemia, category 4 is ischemic rest pain, and categories 5–6 are minor or major tissue loss, respectively. Revascularization should not be attempted if the limb is not viable. 

• 
An ankle-brachial index (ABI) should be performed in every patient with suspected arterial occlusive disease. The ABI is the ratio of systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the ankles compared to the arms, and is calculated as: ankle SBP/brachial SBP. 


A decreased ABI suggests a hemodynamically significant stenosis between the great vessels and the ankles 
since the ankle blood pressure is less than the upper extremity blood pressure. An ABI <0.9 is abnormal. An ABI between 0.5 and 0.9 usually correlates with intermittent claudication. Rest pain is usually present with an ABI <0.4. 
• 
Pulse-volume recordings characterize the Doppler waveform at multiple levels. The anatomic location of a lesion can be deduced by the change from a normal triphasic waveform to a biphasic (moderate stenosis) or flat waveform (severe stenosis/occlusion). 

• 
For anatomical mapping and to confirm ABI and ultrasound findings, CTA or MRA can be done for further characterization. 

• 
CTA can detect luminal narrowing or irregularities, and occlusion due to calcified and non-calcified plaques. However, blooming artifact from the calcified plaque can limit assessment of the arteries below the knee. 

• 
MRA plays an important role in the diagnosis of PAD. Particularly, time-resolved MRA, which obtains a series of images while the contrast is passing through the calves, can demonstrate occlusion or stenosis and complements the conventional MRA images. 

• 
Recently, noncontrast MRA sequence-quiescent interval single shot (QISS) technique has been used clinically with high diagnostic accuracy compared to DSA, while being less prone to artifact than CTA. 



Acute thromboembolic disease 
• 
Acute limb ischemia is an emergency, with a very different clinical and imaging presentation compared to chronic atherosclerotic disease. In acute thromboembolic disease, symptom onset is acute, with pain, pallor, poikilothermia (coldness), pulselessness, and paresthesias. Blue toe syndrome is acute thromboembolism in the toes. 

• 
The most common embolic source is a left atrial thrombus, with atrial fibrillation a significant risk factor. Echocardiography is indicated in the workup. 

• 
CTA or MRA shows an acute cutoff of the affected vessel with a filling defect at the level of the vessel bifurcation. On MRA, filling defect will appear hypointense with mild perivascular hyperenhancement due to inflammation. Significant atherosclerotic disease may be absent. 

• 
Treatment options include surgical embolectomy, surgical bypass graft, and endovascular thrombolysis. 

• 
A popliteal artery aneurysm is defined as a popliteal artery measuring 8 mm or more. 

• 
Popliteal aneurysms are almost always due to atherosclerosis and are associated with other atherosclerotic aneurysms. Approximately 20% of patients with a popliteal aneurysm also have an aortic aneurysm, and up to half have bilateral popliteal aneurysms. 

• 
Popliteal aneurysms are usually asymptomatic. When symptomatic, the typical presenting symptom is distal ischemia due to embolism. Popliteal aneurysm rupture is rare. 

• 
Cross-sectional imaging either with CTA or MRA is important to assess overall size of the popliteal aneurysm, given the mural thrombus can narrow the lumen. 

• 
Treatment with endovascular stent-graft or surgical bypass is recommended for all symptomatic popliteal artery aneurysms and asymptomatic aneurysms >2 cm in diameter. 





Non-atherosclerotic lower extremity arterial disease 
Buerger disease 
• 
As previously discussed, Buerger disease or thromboangiitis obliterans, is a chronic inflammatory, thrombotic arteritis which typically occurs in male smokers. It more commonly involves the legs but may also involve the hands, where it may present with ischemia, ulcerations, and even gangrene. 

• 
On imaging, there are segmental stenoses of the medium and small arteries in the leg, with typical corkscrew collaterals in the vasa vasorum. 

• 
The larger arteries, including the common femoral artery, superficial femoral artery, and popliteal artery, are typically spared. 


Popliteal entrapment syndrome 
• 
Popliteal entrapment syndrome is compression of the popliteal artery by a fibrous band or calf muscles, most commonly an aberrant or hypertrophied medial head of the gastrocnemius. Bilateral involvement is common. 

• 
There are 6 different types of popliteal entrapment, depending on the deviation of the aberrant muscle and the popliteal artery. However, by far the most common anomalies involve the medial head of the gastrocnemius, with either medial deviation (type I) or no deviation (type II) of the popliteal artery. 

• 
Most commonly utilized imaging modality is MRA with dynamic imaging where the patient is asked to perform plantar/dorsal flexion during image acquisition. 

• 
Treatment is surgical release of the offending muscle (usually the medial head of the gastrocnemius). Angiography is only used for diagnosis, not therapy.
