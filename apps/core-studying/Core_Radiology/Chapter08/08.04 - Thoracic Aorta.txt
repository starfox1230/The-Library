Thoracic aortic aneurysm 
Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) 

Thoracic aortic aneurysm: Frontal chest radiograph (left image) demonstrates ectasia of the right aortic border (arrows). Gated contrast-enhanced CT (right image) with a double-oblique short-axis reformation demonstrates an ascending aortic diameter of 4.7 cm, representing an aneurysm. 
• 
A thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is defined as an ascending aortic diameter >4 cm or a descending thoracic aorta >3.5 cm in diameter. Aortic size may also be normalized to body surface area and compared to reference values. Based on Framingham Heart Study participants, ascending aorta >5 cm and descending aorta >4 cm are considered 150% or two standard deviations of normal, and thus aneurysmal. 

• 
Double-oblique short-axis multiplanar reformatted images perpendicular to the aortic lumen (i.e., true short-axis) should always be used to measure aortic diameter. 

• 
Most thoracic aortic aneurysms are caused by atherosclerosis, with the descending thoracic aorta affected more commonly. Almost 1/3 of patients with atherosclerotic TAA will have an associated abdominal aortic aneurysm. 

• 
Non-atherosclerotic causes of TAA include connective tissue disorders (such as Marfan and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes), bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) associated aortopathy, vasculitis (including Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and relapsing polychondritis), cystic medial necrosis, and infectious aortitis. 

• 
Annuloaortic ectasia represents dilated sinuses of Valsalva and ascending aorta with effacement of the sinotubular junction, resulting in a tulip bulb-shaped aorta. Annuloaortic ectasia is associated with Marfan, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, homocystinuria, and osteogenesis imperfecta. 

• 
Surgical treatment is recommended for an ascending TAA >5.5 cm in diameter and a descending TAA >6 cm in diameter. However, patients with connective tissue disorders and BAV aortopathy (meeting criteria for valve replacement) have a lower surgical threshold of 

4.5 cm. Beyond simple size criteria, annual growth rate >1 cm/year (or >5 mm/6 months) is an indication for surgical repair. 

• 
Complications of TAA endoscopic and open repair include rupture, dissection, infection, endoleak, and paraplegia (caused by artery of Adamkiewicz occlusion). 



In.lammatory and in.ectious disorders 
• 
Inflammatory disorders involving the thoracic aorta and great vessels include giant cell arteritis, Takayasu arteritis, rheumatologic disorders, and radiation-induced aortitis. 

• 
Infectious causes of aortitis include syphilis, tuberculosis, pyogenic (especially Salmonella), HIV, and mycotic etiologies. 


Giant cell arteritis (GCA) 

Giant cell arteritis: Two different patients with temporal artery biopsy proven GCA. MRA of the suprarenal aorta (left image) and axial CTA (right image) through the infrarenal aorta demonstrate circumferential aortic wall thickening. 
• 
Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is predominantly a medium- and large-vessel vasculitis that has overlapping imaging findings with Takayasu arteritis. GCA tends to affect older patients (typically greater than 50 years of age) compared to Takayasu arteritis. 

• 
The medium-sized upper extremity arteries are most commonly affected in GCA, including the subclavian, axillary, and brachial arteries. The aorta is rarely involved, unlike in Takayasu arteritis. GCA typically produces long smooth stenoses. 

• 
In comparison, Takayasu arteritis often involves the aorta and is commonly associated with occlusions. 

• 
Definitive diagnosis is with temporal artery biopsy. However, biopsy results could be false negative up to 28% of cases, due to skip lesions or aortic involvement only. 

• 
Imaging findings of GCA on CTA or MRA are circumferential wall thickening of the aortic segments and associated luminal narrowing or aneurysmal dilation. 

• 
FDG-PET/CT also can help in the diagnosis of the large vessel vasculitis: moderate to intense FDG uptake in the involved vessels is the key imaging finding. 

• 
Treatment is steroids and tocilizumab (anti-IL-6). 


Infectious aortitis 
• 
Infectious aortitis most commonly presents as a mycotic aneurysm and less commonly as non-aneurysmal infection, although both may be complicated by rupture. 

• 
Pre-existing abnormality in the wall  including atherosclerotic disease could make it susceptible for infection. 

• 
Most common pathogens are Staph. aureus, Salmonella, Pneumococcus, and E. coli. 

• 
Syphilitic aortitis is a rare cause of aortic wall thickening and aneurysmal dilatation, usually limited to the thoracic aorta. 

• 
CTA, MRA or FDG-PET/CT can be used in the diagnosis of the infectious aortitis. 

• 
Key imaging features are focal, crescentic shape aortic wall thickening, periaortic soft-tissue accumulation, and rapid progression of saccular/mycotic aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm.  


Takayasu arteritis 

Takayasu arteritis: Sagittal-oblique maximum intensity projection MR angiogram (left image) of the aortic arch shows narrowing of the left common carotid artery (yellow arrow) and left subclavian artery (red arrow). Note the incidental common origin of the brachiocephalic trunk and the left common carotid artery. 
Coronal maximum intensity projection MR angiogram (right image) of the abdominal aorta in the same patient shows a long smooth stenosis of the infra-celiac abdominal aorta (blue arrows), with a focal stenosis of the accessory left renal artery (green arrow).

• 
Takayasu arteritis is an idiopathic, inflammatory, large-vessel vasculitis that involves the thoracic and abdominal aorta, subclavian arteries, carotid arteries, pulmonary arteries, and large mesenteric arteries. 

• 
Takayasu arteritis typically affects young to middle-aged women. 

• 
There are two phases in Takayasu’s arteritis: 

a) 
Pre-pulseless phase, which is characterized by the nonspecific constitutional symptoms including mild fever, malaise, weight loss; 

b) 
Pulseless phase, where the patients present with limb ischemia or renovascular hypertension due to arterial stenosis or occlusion. The patients are often imaged in pulseless phase. 



• 
On imaging, long smooth circumferential arterial wall thickening with areas of stenoses and/ or occlusions are classic. Imaging is often indistinguishable from giant cell arteritis, with the patient’s age being the main distinguishing factor. Takayasu arteritis occurs in relatively younger patients and giant cell arteritis is rare in patients under age 50. 

• 
During the acute phase, treatment is with steroids. If symptomatic stenoses occur, endovascular treatment can be performed, but only when the active inflammation has resolved, as measured by normalization of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. 


Aortic coarctation 

Aortic coarctation: Coronal maximum intensity projection MR angiogram (left image) shows extensive collateral vessels throughout the thorax, with prominent internal thoracic arteries (yellow arrows). 3D volume rendered CT of the aorta (top right image) demonstrates the coarctation (blue arrows) distal to the aortic isthmus. Double inversion recovery fast spin echo MRI (bottom right image) also demonstrates the coarctation. 
• 
Aortic coarctation is congenital focal narrowing of the proximal descending aorta. 

• 
The adult form of coarctation is usually juxtaductal (at the junction of the ductus arteriosus), leading to upper extremity hypertension. In contrast, an infant presenting with congestive heart failure due to coarctation is usually due to a preductal variant, which functions as a left ventricular obstructive lesion. 

• 
In the setting of coarctation, prominent collaterals develop between the internal thoracic arteries to both the epigastric vessels and intercostal arteries. 

• 
The radiographic findings of coarctation include the 3-sign of the left upper heart border, which represents a double bulge from the focal aortic narrowing and post-stenotic dilation. Rib notching is frequently seen from collateral intercostal vessels. 

• 
Phase contrast MR imaging can be used to measure the gradient of flow across the coarctation. Calculation of the flow differential between the proximal descending aorta versus the aorta at the hiatus aids in determining hemodynamic significance. 

• 
Aortic coarctation is associated with other cardiovascular anomalies, including bicuspid aortic valve (most common, 75–80%), ventricular septal defect, cyanotic congenital cardiac anomalies, mitral valve abnormalities (parachute mitral valve), and patent ductus arteriosus. 

• 
Aortic coarctation could also be one of the 4 components of Shone syndrome – a left-sided obstructive congenital heart disease that involves: 1) Supravalvular mitral membrane, 2) subvalvular aortic stenosis, 3) parachute mitral valve, 4) aortic coarctation. 

•A 
pseudocoarctation represents kinking or buckling of the aorta, similar in morphology to a true coarctation; however, there is no pressure differential and thus no collaterals. 


Subclavian steal syndrome 
• 
Subclavian steal syndrome is a proximal stenosis or occlusion of the subclavian artery, which leads to retrograde flow from the vertebral artery into the subclavian artery distal to the flow-limiting lesion. 

• 
Subclavian steal syndrome clinically presents with vertebrobasilar insufficiency or syncope exacerbated by arm exercise. There may occasionally be direct signs of brachial artery insufficiency, such as extremity coolness or even fingertip necrosis. 

• 
Subclavian steal is best diagnosed with angiography. The early arterial phase shows the proximal subclavian flow-limiting lesion and the later arterial phase shows retrograde flow from the vertebral artery into the subclavian. However, angiography is usually reserved for endovascular treatment. CTA or MRA can easily detect subclavian artery stenosis. 

• 
Treatment options include surgical bypass or angioplasty of the flow-limiting lesion. 




Superior vena cava (SVC) 
SVC obstruction 
• 
Acute obstruction of the SVC causes SVC syndrome, which clinically presents as facial and upper extremity edema and cyanosis. Acute SVC syndrome is a vascular emergency. 

• 
In contrast to acute SVC syndrome, chronic occlusion or stenosis of the SVC may be asymptomatic. If symptoms are present, facial edema that improves with standing is characteristic. 

• 
The most common causes of SVC obstruction are compression by thoracic malignancy, catheter-associated thrombosis, and mediastinal fibrosis after histoplasmosis exposure. 

• 
The classic imaging findings on MRV or CTV are occlusion of the SVC and based on the location (above or below the azygos vein), collateral vessels form. 

• 
A classic cross-sectional abdominal imaging finding in SVC obstruction is increased enhancement of hepatic segment IVa due to collateral opacification of the vein of Sappey. 


The vein of Sappey drains the liver in the region of the falciform ligament and communicates with internal thoracic veins, which act as collateral vessels in the setting of SVC occlusion. 
• 
Normally, the embryologic left anterior cardinal vein regresses and the right anterior cardinal vein develops into the SVC. 

• 
Left-sided SVC is due to persistence of the embryological left anterior cardinal vein and regression of the right anterior cardinal vein. It is the most common congenital venous anomaly in the chest. 

• 
The left SVC usually drains directly into the coronary sinus g right atrium. 

• 
Rarely, the left SVC drains directly into the left atrium, causing a right to left shunt. 

• 
Left-sided SVC is weakly associated with congenital heart disease (CHD). Left SVC is an incidental finding in 0.5% of the population but is seen in 4% of patients with CHD. 

• 
A duplicated SVC is due to persistence of both the right and left anterior cardinal veins. 

• 
Duplicated SVC also carries an association with CHD. 



Duplicated SVC: Axial (left image) and coronal oblique (right image) CTA shows a structure with contrast mixing (yellow arrow) on the left of the aortic arch that drains into the coronary sinus on oblique reformatted image (red arrow) in keeping with persistent left-sided SVC in a patient with a normal right-sided SVC. 

Duplicated SVC in a different patient: 
Coronal CTA shows right and left SVCs. The left SVC (arrow) is more opacified with contrast because of the left-sided contrast injection.
