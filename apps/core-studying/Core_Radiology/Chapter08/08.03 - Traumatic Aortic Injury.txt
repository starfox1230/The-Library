Chest radiograph in a trauma patient shows indistinct Contrast-enhanced CT shows a mediastinal hematoma widening of the mediastinum. The endotracheal tube and traumatic aortic dissection (arrow). Indistinctness is displaced to the right (arrow). of the lateral arch of the aorta is concerning for tear.

• 
There are three relatively fixed levels of the aorta where traumatic aortic injuries occur secondary to deceleration injury, which are the aortic root, isthmus, and hiatus. The aortic isthmus is the most common location for aortic injuries. Aortic trauma could result in 1) minimal aortic injury, 2) aortic laceration, 3) aortic transection, or 4) aortic pseudoaneurysm. 

• 
Associated injuries to the origins of the brachiocephalic, left carotid, or left subclavian arteries are frequently present. 

• 
CTA is the gold standard for evaluation of suspected traumatic aortic injury. 

• 
Traumatic mediastinal hemorrhage is often venous; however, aortic injury is the primary concern. Direct CT signs of traumatic aortic injury include: intimal irregularity, dissection flap, pseudoaneurysm, or intramural hematoma. 


Mediastinal hemorrhage that is separated from an intact aorta by a fat plane can be presumed to be venous, and treatment is conservative. In contrast, hemorrhage in contact with the aortic wall is suggestive of aortic injury and necessitates surgical treatment. 

Aortic trauma: Contrast-enhanced axial (left image) and coronal (right image) CT show focal disruption of the isthmus and adjacent small hematoma (arrows) consistent with acute aortic injury.

Aortic trauma (continued) 

Aortic trauma: Aortic transection at the level of the diaphragmatic crus (arrow), a common area of injury due to anchoring of structures at the diaphragmatic level. 

Minimal aortic injury 
• 
Approximately 10–30% of blunt traumatic aortic injuries are minimal aortic injury lesions that involve only the intima. 

• 
Mechanisms include rapid deceleration, shearing forces, water-hammer phenomenon, and osseous pinch against the thoracic spine. 

• 
Most common CT findings are intimal irregularity, small intimal flap (<1 cm) with no or little periaortic hematoma, intraluminal aortic thrombus or intramural hematoma.


 Pseudoaneurysm 
• 
Post-traumatic pseudoaneurysm is a contained rupture held in place by the surrounding connective tissues. The most classic location is the aortic isthmus. 

• 
85% of pseudoaneurysms are due to penetrating trauma, 15% from blunt trauma such as motor vehicle accidents or falls. Rarely, they occur due to non-traumatic pathologies such as penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers. 

• 
Chronic pseudoaneurysm can develop in the setting of undiagnosed or untreated aortic injury. On imaging, they often have extensive peripheral calcification and may contain thrombus. Calcification is considered to be protective against rupture.
