Subclavian artery 
• 
The right subclavian artery arises from the brachiocephalic trunk. The left subclavian artery branches directly from the aortic arch. 

• 
The first portion includes the origin to the medial border of the anterior scalene muscle. Branches include: 


Vertebral artery. Internal thoracic artery. Thyrocervical trunk. 
• The second portion lies posterior to the anterior scalene muscle and gives off the: 
Costocervical trunk. 
• The third portion lies between the lateral border of the anterior scalene to the lateral border of the first rib and gives off the: 
Dorsal scapular artery. 

Axillary artery 
• The axillary artery starts from the lateral border of the first rib and courses underneath the pectoralis minor muscle which divides the artery into three anatomical portions. 
subclavian artery 
axillary artery 

brachial artery deep brachial artery common interosseous artery 

ulnar recurrent artery 

radial artery ulnar artery 



Parts of the axillary artery 
The first portion runs from the lateral edge of the first rib to the upper border of the pectoralis minor muscle and branches inferiorly into the superior thoracic artery. 
The second portion runs behind the pectoralis minor muscle and branches superolaterally into the thoracoacromial trunk and inferiorly into the lateral thoracic artery. 
The third portion runs from the lateral border of the pectoralis minor muscle to the teres major muscle, branching into the subscapular artery and the anterior and posterior circum.ex humeral arteries.

Brachial artery 
• 
The brachial artery begins at the lateral edge of the teres major muscle. The branches include the deep brachial artery, the superior ulnar collateral artery, and the inferior ulnar collateral artery. 

• 
The radial nerve parallels the deep brachial artery.

Venous arm anatomy 
• 
The superficial veins arise from the dorsal venous arch on the dorsum of the hand and drain into the cephalic and basilic veins. 

• 
The cephalic vein drains the radial (lateral) side and connects with the subclavian vein. 

• 
The basilic vein drains the ulnar (medial) side and connects with the brachial or axillary vein. 

• 
The deep venous drainage is via the ulnar and radial veins that course closely with corresponding arteries, and merge at the antecubital fossa to form the brachial vein. 

• 
The brachial vein is renamed the axillary vein at the axilla.

Thoracic outlet syndromes (TOS) 
Overview of thoracic outlet syndromes 
• 
Thoracic outlet syndromes (TOS) are a controversial spectrum of disorders caused by compression of either the brachial plexus, subclavian artery, or subclavian vein, clinically presenting with upper extremity paresthesias, pain, numbness, and/or coolness. 

• 
There are three common sites of compression: 

1) The interscalene triangle is the space bounded by the anterior scalene muscle, the middle scalene muscle, and the first rib. The brachial plexus and subclavian artery pass through the interscalene triangle. 
2) Costoclavicular space is the space between the clavicle, first rib and subclavius muscle. The subclavian vein compression is common at this site. 
3) Subpectoral space is the space between the pectoralis minor and coracoid process. Subclavian artery compression is common at this site. 

• 
The neurogenic form of TOS is the most common manifestation, due to mechanical compression of the brachial plexus. Compression of the vascular structures is known as vascular TOS. In this section we will focus on vascular TOS. 

• 
Dynamic imaging either with a CTA or MRA is key in the diagnosis of vascular TOS. Imaging acquisition should be done arms up (hyperabduction) and arms down (neutral) position with two injections of the contrast. For each position arterial and venous images should be acquired. 



Neurogenic TOS 
• 
The neurogenic form of thoracic outlet syndrome is the most common manifestation, due to mechanical compression of the brachial plexus. 

• 
Injury to the upper brachial plexus, C5 and C6, results in paralysis of the shoulder muscles and biceps. Injury to the lower brachial plexus C7 and below results in forearm and hand paralysis. 



Subclavian artery compression due to TOS 
• 
Compression of the subclavian artery clinically presents with hand or finger pain, numbness, paresthesias, or coolness. 

• 
Adson’s maneuver is a test for subclavian artery compression at the thoracic outlet. First, the radial artery is palpated in neutral position. Then, the patient’s head is turned to the contralateral side while they inhale. In arterial thoracic outlet syndrome, the radial pulse will be reduced with this maneuver. 

• 
A mechanical compression is almost always present and is exaggerated during hyperabduction. Over 70% of patients with subclavian artery compression have a cervical rib. Other causes of subclavian artery compression include an accessory scalene muscle (scalenus minimus), enlargement of the anterior scalene muscle, and well-developed musculature. 

• 
Potential complications include arterial mural thrombus, aneurysm, and distal embolization. The hands should always be evaluated for signs of distal emboli. 

• 
The preferred treatment of subclavian artery compression is surgical thoracic outlet decompression (e.g., resection of a cervical rib) and repair of the subclavian artery if an aneurysm is present. 

• 
Endovascular arterial thrombolysis may be performed concurrently, weighed against the risk for distal embolization. 



Subclavian vein compression due to TOS (Paget-Schroetter syndrome) 
• 
Subclavian vein compression is common during hyperabduction; however associated upper limb swelling and pain suggest clinically significant stenosis. Compression of the subclavian vein without thrombosis is also known as McCleery syndrome. 

• 
Paget-Schroetter syndrome is thrombosis (i.e., effort thrombosis) of the subclavian vein as it enters the thorax and is usually seen in muscular young men. Chronic compression causes intimal hyperplasia, which leads to subclavian vein thrombosis. Paget-Schroetter syndrome clinically presents with upper-extremity swelling or pain worsened with effort. 

• 
Stents should generally not be used, especially if there is a mechanical obstruction, due to high risk of device failure. 


• 
During diagnostic venography, it is necessary to evaluate the arm both in neutral position and abducted. 

• 
CTA and MRA can diagnose thrombosed subclavian vein as a filling defect. Both sides should be evaluated. Frequently, both subclavian veins are compressed, even if only one side is symptomatic. 

• 
Depending on the chronicity of disease, treatment is thrombolysis followed by surgical thoracic outlet decompression. 





Hand anatomy and pathologies 
Hypothenar hammer syndrome (HHS) 
• 
Hypothenar hammer syndrome represents injury to the ulnar artery as it crosses the hamate bone. Chronic repetitive trauma causes the ulnar artery to chronically be traumatized at the hamate, leading to intimal injury, thrombus, aneurysm, or pseudoaneurysm. 

• 
The classic clinical history of hypothenar hammer syndrome is a jackhammer operator with ischemia of the fourth and fifth digits. 

• 
Ultrasound should be used as an initial imaging modality, followed by CTA or MRA. Classic imaging features include corkscrew or tortuous appearance of the distal ulnar artery at the level of the hook of the hamate. Aneurysmal dilation and distal embolic occlusions are seen due to distal thrombi, usually in the fourth and fifth fingers. 

• 
Treatment is surgical, as there is often ulnar artery injury not apparent on angiography. 


Buerger disease 
• 
Buerger disease or thromboangiitis obliterans, is a chronic inflammatory, thrombotic arteritis that affects the lower extremities (most commonly) and the hands (less commonly). It is seen in adult male smokers and should be clinically suspected in a middle-aged male presenting with claudication. Primary treatment of Buerger disease is smoking cessation. 

• 
Small vessel occlusions and distal corkscrew collaterals are the typical angiographic features. 


Raynaud disease 
• 
Raynaud disease is small arterial vasospasm triggered by cold temperature. Raynaud disease is associated with scleroderma and other connective tissue disorders. 

• 
On imaging, there is decreased perfusion of the distal digital arteries, with improvement upon warming or vasodilator administration. 


Thromboembolic disease 
• 
Thromboembolic disease of the upper extremities is most commonly caused by cardiac emboli (of which atrial fibrillation is a common cause). Less commonly, a subclavian artery aneurysm may be the source of the thrombus. 

• 
If the source of emboli is central (such as the heart), bilateral disease would be expected, while a unilateral lesion would show unilateral emboli. 

• 
The characteristic imaging feature of distal thromboembolic disease is occlusion of distal small arteries of the hand.
