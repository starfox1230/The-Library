Intradural extramedullary lesions 
Overview of intradural extramedullary lesions 
• 
Intradural extramedullary lesions are located within the dura but outside the spinal cord, usually involving the nerve roots or meninges and projecting into the subarachnoid space. A subset of this category are lesions of the conus medullaris, cauda equina, and filum terminale, which have a distinct differential diagnosis. 

• 
Intradural extramedullary lesions may deviate/ compress the spinal cord. CSF is seen above and below the lesion, as well as possibly as a cleft between the lesion and the cord. 

• 
Nerve sheath tumors (neurofibromas and schwannomas) and meningiomas comprise 90% of intradural extramedullary neoplasms, although which is the single most common tumor varies by source. Leptomeningeal metastases are less common. 

• 
Myxopapillary ependymomas are the most common tumor in the cauda equina region. Spinal paragangliomas are less common but also almost always arise in this region. 




Intradural-extramedullary mass: Sagittal T2-weighted (left image) and axial T1-weighted post-contrast (right image) MRI shows an intradural thoracic mass (arrows). The mass is distinct from the spinal cord and displaces the cord posteriorly. The axial image shows severe posterior compression of the cord (arrow) by the avidly enhancing mass. This was a meningioma. Usually, however, thoracic meningiomas are posterior to the spinal cord. 

Intradural extramedullary spinal neoplasms 
Meningioma 
• 
Typical meningiomas are benign (WHO grade I) intradural extramedullary neoplasms. More aggressive variants (WHO grade II and III) are less common. Less than 10% are extradural, or both intradural and extradural. 

• 
Spinal meningiomas are most commonly seen in older women. Radiation exposure is an additional risk factor. 

• 
Meningiomas are associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), especially in children or if multiple. 

• 
Imaging classically shows an intensely enhancing mass with a dural tail. Calcification is uncommon. The thoracic region is most commonly involved. 

• 
Spinal nerve sheath tumors are mostly benign (WHO grade I) intradural extramedullary tumors which arise from nerve roots, including schwannoma (more common) and neurofibroma. 15% are both intradural and extradural; 15% are completely extradural. Intramedullary cases are rare. 

• 
While most cases are isolated, multiple lesions in younger patients are seen in neurofibromatosis type 1 (neurofibroma) and type 2 (schwannoma). Schwannomatosis is another genetic disorder with multiple schwannomas. 

• 
Spinal schwannomas most commonly involve the lumbar region and are the second most common tumor in the cauda equina region. Spinal neurofibromas most commonly involve the cervical region. 

• 
Tumors with intraspinal, foraminal, and extraforaminal components are called “dumbbell” tumors, due to the restrained growth at the neural foramen, which may be enlarged by pressure erosion. Dumbbell tumors are most commonly nerve sheath tumors and may be both intradural and extradural or completely extradural. 

• 
Schwannoma and neurofibroma have similar imaging appearances, presenting on MRI as a T2-hyperintense enhancing intradural mass. Some show the target sign (central hypointensity on T2-weighted images surrounded by a hyperintense periphery). Larger schwannomas may show cystic change. 

• 
Schwannomas are encapsulated and separable from the parent nerve, so nerve-sparing resection is possible. Neurofibromas are unencapsulated and infiltrate between nerve fascicles, so complete resection necessitates nerve sacrifice. 


Myxopapillary ependymoma 

Myxopapillary ependymoma: Sagittal T2 (left image), T1 (middle image), and post-contrast T1-weighted (right image) MRI demonstrate a heterogeneously T2 hyperintense, lobulated mass (red arrows) containing regions of hypointensity on the T2-weighted image. The mass is located at the conus medullaris and avidly enhances. There is also enhancing leptomeningeal dissemination along the surface of the more proximal cord (yellow arrows) and along the cauda equina nerve roots (blue arrow).

• 
Myxopapillary ependymomas are the most common tumor of the cauda equina region, arising from ependymal glia within the conus medullaris and filum terminale. They are a benign (WHO grade I) variant of ependymoma. 

• 
The tumor is characterized by slow growth, classically presenting when larger and sausage-shaped, causing vertebral scalloping and spinal canal enlargement. It frequently hemorrhages, resulting in peripheral hemosiderin deposits as hypointensity on T2-weighted images and blooming on GRE. 


Paraganglioma 
• 
Spinal paragangliomas are rare and arise almost exclusively in the filum terminale and cauda equina region. 

• 
Similar to paragangliomas elsewhere, spinal paragangliomas show well-circumscribed margins, hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, avid contrast enhancement, and vascular flow voids. 



Intradural extramedullary spinal congenital/developmental lesions 
Overview of spinal dysraphisms 
• 
Spinal dysraphisms are a spectrum of congenital midline fusion abnormalities involving neuroectodermal, ectodermal, and/or mesodermal tissues related to the spine and spinal cord. 

• 
Spinal dysraphisms are classified as open (not covered by intact skin) or closed (covered by skin). Closed spinal dysraphisms are more common. 

• 
Older terms include spina bifida occulta (for closed spinal dysraphism) and spina bifida aperta/cystica (for open spinal dysraphism). Spina bifida, strictly speaking, refers to unfused posterior vertebral elements but is usually used to refer to spinal dysraphism in general. 

• 
The most common open spinal dysraphism is myelomeningocele. 

• 
The spectrum of closed spinal dysraphism includes split cord malformations, caudal regression syndrome, persistent ventriculus terminalis, dorsal dermal sinus, neurenteric cyst, spinal lipoma variants including lipomyelomeningocele, meningocele (herniation of CSF-filled dural sac), and myelocystocele (herniation of syrinx outside spinal canal). 


Myelomeningocele 
• 
Myelomeningocele is a neural tube defect in which neural placode (embryonic neural tissue) and meninges protrude through defective vertebral posterior elements and are exposed above the skin surface. 

• 
The lumbosacral region is most commonly involved. Patients have neurologic deficits involving the bowel, bladder, and lower extremities. 

• 
Myelomeningocele is nearly always associated with Chiari II malformation. Hydrocephalus is present in most cases. 

• 
The defect must be surgically repaired soon after birth. A common complication in children with previously repaired myelomeningocele is tethered cord syndrome. 


Split cord malformation 
• Split cord malformations are forms of spinal dysraphism in which a segment of the spinal cord is divided/duplicated. They are classified into those contained within double dural sacs separated by a rigid (osseocartilaginous) septum (type I) and those contained within a single dural sac separated by a nonrigid (fibrous) septum (type II). 

Diastematomyelia: Coronal T2-weighted MRI (left image) shows CSF between the two hemicords (arrows) and a thoracolumbar dextroscoliosis. Axial T2-weighted MRI (right image) shows two hemicords (arrows) within a single CSF space. 
• Historical terminology for split cords is inconsistently applied. 
Diastematomyelia, sometimes interchanged with split cord, refers to a sagittal bifurcation of the spinal cord into left and right hemicords, each containing a single set of dorsal and ventral horns and nerve roots. Diplomyelia is the presence of an accessory spinal cord without roots, located dorsal or ventral to the 
main cord. They are contained in a single dural sac. Dimyelia (rare) is duplication of the spinal cord, with each cord having a complete set of roots. They are separated into two dural sacs. 
• 
Bony/cartilaginous septa are well seen on imaging but fibrous septa may be too thin to visualize on conventional imaging. 

• 
Splits are most commonly located caudally in the thoracolumbar cord. 


Caudal regression syndrome 
• 
Caudal regression syndrome is a spectrum of structural defects (dysgenesis, hypogenesis, or agenesis) of the sacrococcygeal and sometimes lumbar region involving the spine, spinal cord, and often genitourinary or gastrointestinal tracts. The spinal cord conus medullaris may terminate higher than normal or lower due to tethering. 

• 
Infants of diabetic mothers are at higher risk. 


Tethered cord syndrome 
• 
Tethered cord syndrome is a clinical syndrome of neurologic deficits (e.g. back and leg pain, gait spasticity, and decreased lower extremity sensation) attributed to fixation/traction of the caudal portion of the spinal cord. 

• 
Common causes include spinal lipomas, tight filum terminale (thickened >2 mm), and post-repair myelomeningocele. 

• 
Normally, the conus should terminate superior to the inferior endplate of L2. If the conus terminates below this level, the cord may be tethered. 


Spinal lipomas 
• 
Spinal lipomas have widely varying classifications/terminology. They are congenital, non-neoplastic fatty lesions that occur along the dorsal midline spinal canal and are typically intradural but can also have extradural components. 

• 
Filar lipoma refers to the linear/tubular fibrofatty thickening of the filum terminale. MRI demonstrates hyperintensity on T1-weighted images. It is usually clinically insignificant but may be associated with tethered cord syndrome. 



Fatty filum: 
Sagittal T1-weighted MRI shows a hyperintense lesion in the filum (arrow), representing fat in the filum terminale. 
Of note, a potential pitfall is to mistake an enhancing vessel as a fatty filum. A fatty filum will be apparent on the noncontrast sequences as well. 
• Lipomyelomeningocele refers to a combination of lipoma and myelomeningocele where the neural placode-lipoma interface protrudes outside the spinal canal. 

Persistent ventriculus terminalis 
• 
The ventriculus terminalis, also called the fifth ventricle, is a dilatation of the spinal cord central canal at the conus medullaris that normally regresses in infancy. Abnormal persistence/dilatation in older children and adults can be a cause of neurologic deficits. 

• 
The imaging differential in neonates includes a filar cyst, which is a normal variant structure inferior to the conus that does not connect with the central canal. 



Dorsal dermal sinus 
• 
Dorsal dermal sinuses are epithelial-lined tracts extending from neural tissue to the dorsal skin. Physical examination shows a dimple or pinpoint ostium in the midline back. 

• 
Dorsal dermal sinuses predominantly occur in the lumbosacral region. 

• 
They are often associated with an intradural dermoid (more common) or epidermoid cyst. 


Dermoid cyst 
• 
Dermoid cysts are congenital lesions that usually present in childhood. 

• 
Similar to dermoids present elsewhere, they contain macroscopic fat, which is hyperintense on T1-weighted images. 

• 
Rare dermoid rupture may cause potentially fatal chemical meningitis. 



Sagittal T2 (left image) and T1 post-contrast (middle image) MRI show a large heterogeneously T2 hyperintense, nonenhancing intradural extramedullary mass (yellow arrows) which displaces the conus and cauda equina roots. The mass demonstrates restricted diffusion (right image, red arrow). These findings are consistent with an epidermoid. 

• 
Spinal epidermoid cysts are more often acquired than congenital. Acquired spinal epidermoids are caused by implantation of skin elements in the subarachnoid space during spinal puncture. 

• 
Spinal epidermoids are usually intradural extramedullary but may rarely be intramedullary. 

• 
Most commonly, an epidermoid cyst appears similar to a simple cyst on conventional MR sequences (hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images). Faint peripheral rim enhancement can be seen. Occasionally, the cyst contents may be proteinaceous, causing T1 shortening. 

• 
As with epidermoids elsewhere, diffusivity is restricted. 


Arachnoid cyst 


• An arachnoid cyst is a CSF collection, usually intradural but occasionally extradural, that may be congenital or a result of trauma, post-operative scarring, or inflammation. Arachnoid cysts follow CSF in all MRI sequences and as such can be di.cult to distinguish from 
surrounding CSF. Displacement of the cord or a broad impression on the cord could represent mass effect from an arachnoid cyst and should prompt scrutiny for cyst walls. 

• 
An arachnoid web is an abnormal arachnoid membrane in the subarachnoid space. These can be di.cult to visualize on MRI but should be suspected in the presence of a spinal cord deformity or obstructed CSF flow without defined walls. 

• 
Spinal arachnoid cysts and webs are most commonly located dorsal to the thoracic cord. 

• 
The classic imaging finding is a focal dorsal indentation of the spinal cord, called the scalpel sign on sagittal images. 


Neurenteric cyst 
• 
Neurenteric cyst is a rare lesion composed of heterotopic endodermal tissue, occurring most frequently in the cervical segment, ventral to the spinal cord. 

• 
Imaging findings include non-enhancing lesions which are iso- to slightly hyperintense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. 

• 
Patients frequently have congenital vertebral body anomalies at the same level. 


Spinal cord herniation 



Cord herniation: 
Sagittal T1 and T2 MRI (left and middle images) show focal anterior deformity of the thoracic cord, due to anterior herniation of the cord through a ventral dural defect (yellow arrow). There is associated mild intramedullary T2 signal abnormality (red arrows) and prominence of the dorsal subarachnoid space at this level (axial T2, above). 
• 
Cord herniation is a cause of myelopathy when the spinal cord plugs and protrudes through a dural defect, usually ventrally involving the thoracic cord. 

• 
Cord herniation is typically idiopathic but can be related to prior trauma or surgery. 

• 
MRI or CT myelography shows an anteriorly displaced and focally kinked or C-shaped spinal cord with interruption of the ventral CSF space. Soft tissue may be seen extending into the epidural space. 

• 
The differential diagnosis includes intradural extramedullary lesions that appear as a widened dorsal CSF space such as arachnoid web and arachnoid cyst. 



Intradural extramedullary spinal infectious/inflammatory lesions 
Arachnoiditis 
• 
Arachnoiditis is inflammation of the spinal leptomeninges, which can produce fibrous adhesions involving the subarachnoid space or dura. 

• 
The most common cause is lumbar spine surgery; arachnoiditis is an occasional cause of failed back surgery syndrome (recurrent or persistent pain after surgery). Other causes include infection (e.g. tuberculosis) and chemical injury via intrathecal injection (e.g. steroids, anesthetic). 

• 
The primary imaging feature of lumbar adhesive arachnoiditis is displacement of the cauda equina nerve roots. Three patterns have been described: 


Group 1: Central conglomerations of nerve roots within the thecal sac. Group 2: Peripheral clumping of nerve roots, causing the empty thecal sac sign. Group 3: Obliteration of the subarachnoid space. Imaging shows increased soft tissue within the thecal 
sac. This is the most severe form of arachnoiditis. 

Guillain-Barré syndrome 
• 
Guillain-Barré syndrome is most commonly an acute inflammatory, demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) characterized by symmetric weakness and diminished reflexes with classically ascending (distal-to-proximal) progression over several weeks. 

• 
The mechanism is characterized by an antecedent infection evoking an immune response. The most common preceding infection is Campylobacter jejuni. 

• 
Spinal MRI shows enhancement and thickening of cauda equina nerve roots. 


Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) 
• 
CIDP is an acquired immune-mediated neuropathy most commonly characterized by  symmetric sensorimotor proximal and distal involvement, with a progressive or recurrent course lasting at least several months. 

• 
MRI shows enhancement and thickening of affected spinal nerve roots (sometimes intradural such as cauda equina but more often extradural), plexi, and peripheral nerves.
