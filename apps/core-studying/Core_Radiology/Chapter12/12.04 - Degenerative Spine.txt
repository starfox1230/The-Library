Degenerative spine 
Overview of degenerative spine 
• 
Symptomatic lumbar spine degeneration is extraordinarily common and imposes a large societal health care burden. 

• 
The major anatomic units involved in lumbar spine degeneration are the disc-endplate complexes anteriorly, and the facet joints and ligamentum flavum posteriorly. 

• 
Symptoms may be due to neural compression (typically producing radicular pain) or localized inflammatory changes (typically producing axial back pain). 

• 
Neural compression may occur at any of three sites: The spinal canal, the lateral recess, or the neural foramen. Each of these will be discussed in detail. 

• 
Axial back pain may come from the disc-endplate complex (such as endplate edema, acute Schmorl's node, or annular fissure), or facet arthropathy. Again, these will be subsequently discussed. 

• 
In order to best guide surgical, interventional pain, and conservative management options, it is important to have consistent nomenclature and grading of spinal degenerative findings. 

• 
In 2014, the North American Spine Society, American Society of Spine Radiology, and the American Society of Neuroradiology published their version 2.0 of lumbar disc nomenclature, which was revised from the initial 1995 version. This text will adhere to these consensus nomenclature guidelines, which are bolded and italicized throughout this section. Of note, the nomenclature aims to describe morphology of lumbar degenerative findings, but only discusses grading of severity in a cursory manner. 

• 
Several detailed grading schemes have been proposed for the severity of spinal stenosis, lateral recess stenosis, neural foraminal stenosis, and facet arthropathy. We will attempt to synthesize these into a simplified universal classification. 

• 
Despite efforts to standardize the nomenclature and grading, there is a fair amount of inter-observer variability in the reporting of degenerative spinal lesions. 



Anterior structures: Disc-endplate complexes 
Structure and patterns of injury of the disc-endplate complex 
• 
The intervertebral discs and vertebral body endplates function together as a load-bearing unit, allowing flexion and extension. 

• 
The normal intervertebral disc is composed of a central gelatinous nucleus pulposus and a fibrous peripheral annulus fibrosus. 

• 
The vertebral body endplate is comprised of a thin layer of hyaline cartilage. Branches of the segmental lumbar arteries supply the endplates (but not the disc itself in adults), and diffusion of nutrients across the endplate is an important source of nutrients for the disc. 

• 
Of the disc-endplate complex, it is the endplates that are most susceptible to axial loading, resulting in endplate fractures. 

• 
Chronic tensile stress on posterior aspect of annulus fibrosus (such as due to repeated spinal flexion, especially if under load due to suboptimal spinal mechanics) can lead to a progressive spiral of degenerative changes involving the disc-endplate complex. 

• 
Discovertebral degeneration may include a spectrum of morphologic changes including disc dessication, disc fibrosis, disc height loss, disc mucinous degeneration, intradiscal gas, vertebral osteophytes, vertebral endplate edema, and vertebral endplate sclerosis. 



Disc bulge and herniation (protrusion and extrusion) 
• 
A disc herniation is a focal displacement of disc material, occurring when the substance of the disc (nucleus pulposus, annulus fibrosus, or both) extends beyond the disc’s normal margins. A disc herniation should encompass less than 90° of the disc circumference. 

• 
A disc herniation can be classified as either a protrusion or an extrusion, dependent on the width of its neck. A protrusion features a neck wider than the dome, while an extrusion has a dome wider than the neck (similar to a saccular aneurysm). Because protrusion and extrusion are more specific terms, the term herniation should generally not be used in radiology reports.

(analogous to a saccular aneurysm)  
note that extrusion may be craniocaudal  


• 
A disc bulge is defined as disc material extending beyond the edges of the ring apophyses extending >180° of the disc. There is no need to embellish this consensus terminology with unnecessary words such as “diffuse disc bulge” or “broad-based disc bulge.” 

• 
Disc tissue extending beyond the limits of the disc space between 90° and 180° can be described as an asymmetric disc bulge. 

• 
Disc herniations may extend through the a gap in the cartilagenous endplate, causing an intravertebral herniation, much more commonly referred to as a Schmorl node. 

• 
Several terms and variations describe the medial-lateral position of a herniation: Central, subarticular, foraminal, and extra-foraminal, as illustrated on the following page. 


A central herniation is midline. For a lesion that is just lateral to midline, the terms right central or left central are preferred, although right or left paracentral is also acceptable. The subarticular zone is located at the lateral recess, in the region of the traversing dorsal and ventral 
nerve roots, as they separate from the spinal cord (upper lumbar) or the cauda equina (mid to lower lumbar). 
• 
The medial-lateral position of herniation determines which nerve root will be affected. Lesions in the central (including right or left central for lesions just parasagittal to midline) or subarticular (lateral recess) locations may compress the  descending/traversing nerve root, while foraminal or extra-foraminal lesions may compress the exiting nerve root. 

• 
There is often heterogeneity in the use of the “off-midline” locations described above: For instance, right central, right paracentral, and right subarticular are often used interchangeably. This is fine as long as any relevant neural compression is discussed. 

• 
Disc material may separate from its parent disc to become a sequestered fragment, which may migrate inferiorly or superiorly.

• 
In the thoracic and lumbar spine, each nerve root exits below its corresponding vertebral body. For instance, the L4 nerve root exits below the L4 vertebral body at L4–L5. 

• 
In contrast, in the cervical spine, each root exits above its corresponding vertebral body. For instance, the C7 nerve root exits above the C7 vertebral body at C6–C7. At the cervicothoracic transition, the C8 nerve root exits below the C7 vertebral body and the T1 nerve root exits below the T1 vertebral body. 


Annular fi ssure 
• 
An annular .ssure is a linear hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images in the annulus fibrosis of the intervertebral disc. This imaging finding is thought to correlate with injury of the annulus fibrosis and may be a cause of pain. 

• 
Annular .ssure is the preferred term over annular tear, as this process is thought to be degenerative in most cases, rather than

traumatic. 

Secondary vertebral body changes – Modic changes 
• 
Degenerative changes in the spine are associated with vertebral body endplate and subchondral marrow signal changes that were described and classified by Modic. 

• 
Modic type 1 changes are edema: Hyperintense on T2-weighted and STIR images and hypointense on T1-weighted images. These changes may be associated with active back pain. 

• 
Modic type 2 changes are fatty metaplasia: Hyperintense on both T2- and T1-weighted images and hypointense on STIR. Modic 2 changes are less likely to be associated with active symptoms. 

• 
Modic type 3 changes are fibrosis: Hypointense on all sequences. Their clinical significance is unclear, but are chronic in timecourse. 



Posterior structures: Facet .oints and ligamentum flavum 
Facet arthropathy/facet hypertrophy 
• 
The intervertebral facet joints are synovial joints that can undergo the same degenerative processes as larger synovial joints, including cartilage loss, osteophytosis, sclerosis, and subchondral cystic change. 

• 
Degenerative changes of the facet joints (facet arthropathy) may contribute to neural foraminal narrowing and spinal stenosis due to mass effect from osteophytes and reactive ligamentum flavum thickening. 

• 
Facet effusions are associated with spinal instability (motion on flexion-extension films). 

• 
Reactive bone marrow changes or soft tissue edema can be seen in active/symptomatic facet arthropathy. 

• 
A synovial cyst is a ganglion cyst associated with facet arthropathy. 


Ligamentum flavum thickening/hypertrophy 
• 
The ligamentum flavum lines the lamina at the posterior aspect of the spinal canal. Thickening of the ligamentum flavum can contribute to spinal canal stenosis. 

• 
Ligamentum flavum thickening is rarely seen in isolation and is usually reactive to subjacent facet arthropathy. 



Degenerative spine grading 
Overview of grading of degenerative spine 
• 
Reliable grading of degenerative spine is critically important to direct optimal treatment, to ensure reliable communication between practitioners of various specialties, and even for insurance reimbursement. 

• 
To our knowledge, this information is not tested on board examinations, but we hope this classification scheme will be useful to you in your clinical work. 

• 
This classification scheme has been developed with multidisciplinary input from orthopedic spine surgery, neurosurgery, physiatry, and radiology. It is a simplification and synthesis of several existing classification systems (please see references). 

• 
Nerve roots may be impinged (compressed) within the spinal canal, the lateral recess, or the neural foramen. Therefore, each of these locations should be either described as normal or graded if abnormal. 

• 
Additionally, facet arthropathy may be an active symptom generator and should be separately described. 


Spinal stenosis 
• 
Clinically, spinal stenosis may be asymptomatic or may be a cause of radicular pain or neurogenic claudication. 

• 
At a normal level distal to the level of the conus (typically below the L1–L2 level), the nerve roots should be freely distributed within the CSF. The traversing (also called the descending) nerve roots course inferiorly and laterally towards the lateral recesses on each side, prior to exiting the neural foramina. The anterior margin of the thecal sac should be either flat or convex. The posterior epidural fat should form a clean triangle (although this may be minuscule at L5–S1). 

• 
The degree of spinal stenosis is best assessed on the axial T2-weighted sequence. 


Spinal stenosis (continued) Neural foraminal stenosis

• 
The neural foramina are paired openings at each intervertebral spinal level through which the spinal nerve roots pass. They are located at the lateral aspects of the vertebral canal, and are bounded by the intervertebral disc-endplate complexes anteriorly, the articular processes and facet joints posteriorly, and the pedicles inferiorly and superiorly. Thus, a combination of discovertebral degeneration and facet arthropathy (and the overlying ligamentum flavum) may contribute to neural foraminal stenosis. 

• 
Normally, the exiting nerve should be completely surrounded by epidural fat with a keyhole morphology. Note that if there is simply some effacement of epidural fat at the inferior margin of the keyhole but the nerve remains surrounded by epidural that is still normal. 

• 
Mild neural foraminal stenosis is contact of the nerve root on two or three sides with otherwise preserved epidural fat and no neural compression. 

• 
Moderate neural foraminal stenosis is contact of the nerve root by three or four sides with partial effacement of epidural fat. 

• 
Severe neural foraminal stenosis is complete effacement of epidural fat or compression of the nerve root. 

• 
The neural foramina are best assessed on the sagittal T1-weighted images. 


Lateral recess stenosis

at the junction of the lateral recess and neural foramen. 
The left lateral recess is normal.

• 
The lateral recess is the lateral portion of the thecal sac where the traversing nerve roots course just before entering the neural foramina. It is an often neglected site in radiologists’ dictations but it is an important potential site of nerve root compression. 

• 
Rather than grading as mild, moderate, and severe, we propose simply describing if there is abutment (synonymous with contact) or compression of the traversing nerve root. 

• 
The lateral recess is best assessed on axial T2-weighted images. 


Facet arthropathy 
Facet Arthropathy  
Mild Facet Arthropathy • • •  Moderate Facet Arthropathy  Severe Facet Arthropathy  
• • Minimal to small osteophytes • Mild subchondral irregularity • • Tiny to small subchondral cysts •  • Moderate-size osteophytes • Moderate subchondral irregularity • Moderate size subchondral cysts or synovial cysts • E˜usion, periarticular edema or osseous edema  • Bulky osteophytes with dorsal mass e˜ect on the thecal sac • Marked subchondral irregularity • Large subchondral cysts or synovial cysts • E˜usion, periarticular edema or osseous edema

• 
Facet arthropathy is important to identify and accurately grade, as the facet joints can contribute to spinal, foraminal, or lateral recess stenosis. 

• 
As previously discussed, facet effusions are associated with spinal instability and if a decompression is performed in the setting of instability, an instrumented fusion is typically the optimal treatment. 

• 
Secondary signs of active facet arthropathy include effusion, reactive osseous edema (typically extending into the pedicles), and reactive soft tissue edema. 

• 
Active facet arthropathy can be treated by interventional pain procedures including intra-articular steroid injection, median branch block, and radiofrequency ablation.
