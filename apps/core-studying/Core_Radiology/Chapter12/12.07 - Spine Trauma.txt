Spine trauma 
Three column concept 

• 
The Denis three-column concept helps to classify injury severity. Fractures or ligamentous injury involving only one column are generally stable, while injuries with involvement of two or more columns are unstable. 

• 
For instance, an anterior compression fracture involves the anterior column only. In contrast, a burst fracture involves failure of the anterior and middle columns and is unstable. More severe injuries may involve all three columns. 

• 
Each column has ligamentous and osseous stabilizers. 

• 
The middle column has been variably described as consisting of the posterior 1/2 or the posterior 1/3 of the vertebral body; however, the important point is that the posterior vertebral cortex and posterior disc is in the middle column. 

• 
The posterior ligamentous complex consists of the ligamentum flavum, the intraspinous ligament, and the supraspinous ligament, and is an important ligamentous stabilizer of the posterior column. 

• 
While the Denis model remains helpful in conceptualizing spinal trauma, it has been superseded by the injury classification and severity scales and the AO spine classification which are described subsequently. 




Cervical spine trauma 
Intervals 
• The basion-dental interval and atlanto-dental interval (also known as the atlanto-axial 
interval) should be evaluated in every lateral cervical spine radiograph. 
An increased basion-dental interval >12 mm suggests craniocervical dissociation. 
An increased atlanto-dental interval >2.5 mm (some authors suggest 3 mm as a cutoff) can be seen in 
ligamentous laxity and resultant subluxation. 
The atlanto-dental interval (ADI), also known as the atlanto-axial interval, should be <2.5 mm in adults. Lateral cervical spine radiograph shows widening of the ADI (arrows) to >1 cm, indicative of anterior subluxation. 
The C1 vertebral body is known as the atlas (who carried the globe on his shoulders) and does not have a body; instead it provides structural support via its lateral masses. C2 is known as the axis (allows rotation). 
• Note the above cutoffs were established on radiography. The normal basion-dental interval on CT is slightly under 10 mm; the normal atlanto-dental interval on CT is 2 mm. 

Lines 
• Every lateral cervical spine radiograph should be evaluated for continuity and smoothness of the 4 primary osseous contours. 

spinous process line 
posterior vertebral line 
Anterior vertebral line: Traces the anterior margin of the vertebral bodies. The prevertebral soft tissues 
are located anterior to the anterior vertebral line. Posterior vertebral line: Traces the posterior margin of the vertebral bodies and the anterior margin of the spinal canal. The spinal canal is the space between the posterior vertebral and spinolaminar lines. 
Spinolaminar line: Traces the posterior margin of the spinal canal. Spinous process line: Traces the posterior tips of the spinous processes.

Imaging in cervical spine trauma 
• 
Per the ACR appropriateness criteria for suspected spine trauma (last revised 2018), if the patient (age 16 or greater) does not meet clinical criteria for imaging by NEXUS or CCR (Canadian C-Spine Rules), then imaging of any modality is usually not appropriate. Of note, there is no role for x-rays in “low energy” trauma if imaging is not indicated on clinical grounds. 

• 
If imaging is indicated by clinical criteria, then CT is the preferred initial imaging modality, as CT is more sensitive and has largely supplanted radiographs for assessment of trauma. 

• 
MRI should be performed in patients with concern for spinal cord injury, cord compression, or ligamentous injury. However, MRI is inferior to CT in identifying fractures and should generally not be the initial imaging modality in trauma. 


Subaxial injury classifi cation and severity scale (SLICS) 
• The subaxial injury classification and severity scale (SLICS) provides points for three categories of injury severity, including injury morphology, disruption of the discoligamentous complex, and neurological status. Injuries with greater than 4 points are usually treated surgically. It is not necessary to memorize this classification, but it is well established and helpful to guide management. 
Occipital condyle fractures 
• 
Occipital condyle fractures are uncommon and typically classified into three patterns. 

• 
Type I (stable) is a nondisplaced comminuted impaction fracture from axial loading. 

• 
Type II (stable) is a linear skull fracture extending into the occipital condyle. 

• 
Type III (unstable) is distraction injury resulting in an avulsion fracture at attachment of the alar ligament, which is disrupted or incompetent. This is the most common fracture type. 

• 
MRI is an important adjunct to determine stability and ligament integrity, and can help differentiate between a type I fracture and a minimally displaced type III avulsion fracture. 



Jefferson fracture 

Jefferson fracture: Axial CT demonstrates a fracture of the anterior arch of C1 near the midline (yellow arrow) and bilateral posterior arch fractures (red arrows). 
• 
A Jefferson fracture results from acute axial blow to the vertex of the head, causing symmetrical fractures of the anterior and posterior arches of C1. 

• 
On an open-mouth odontoid radiograph, the lateral masses of C1 are displaced laterally. Jefferson fracture is best seen on axial CT. 


Odontoid fracture 

Type I odontoid fracture Type II odontoid fracture Type III odontoid fracture 
Three patients with odontoid fractures: 
Type I odontoid fracture: Coronal CT (left image) demonstrates an oblique fracture of the tip of the dens (yellow arrow). 
Type II odontoid fracture: Sagittal CT (middle image) shows a mildly displaced and angulated fracture through the base of the dens (yellow arrow). 
Type III odontoid fracture: Sagittal CT (right image) shows a nondisplaced fracture through base of the dens extending into the vertebral body (yellow arrow). There is surrounding callus formation anteriorly (red arrow), in keeping with subacute chronicity. 
• 
Fractures of the odontoid process of C2 are usually caused by flexion injuries. 

• 
Type I odontoid fracture is a fracture of the distal tip of the dens. Type I odontoid fractures are considered stable and treatment is generally conservative. The differential diagnosis of a Type I odontoid fracture is an os odontoideum, a normal variant secondary ossification center located at the tip of the dens. 

• 
Type II odontoid fracture is a fracture of the base of the dens. It is considered an unstable injury and treatment is typically surgical fusion. 

• 
Type III odontoid fracture is a fracture of the base of the dens extending into the C2 vertebral body. Type III fractures are variably described in the literature as both stable and unstable. 



Hangman’s fracture 
• 
Hangman’s fracture is traumatic spondylolysis of C2. It results from hyperextension and distraction, causing bilateral fractures through the pedicles of C2. 

• 
The characteristic radiographic finding is disruption of the spinolaminar line. 

• 
A hangman’s fracture with >3 mm displacement of C2 on C3 is likely unstable. 



Burst fracture 
• A burst fracture is similar in mechanism (axial loading) and appearance to a Jefferson fracture, but occurs lower in the cervical spine, at C2–C7. 
Flexion teardrop fracture 

Lateral radiograph Sagittal STIR MRI Post-operative radiograph 
Flexion teardrop fracture: Presentation radiograph demonstrates an anterior teardrop fragment (yellow arrow) and retropulsion of C5 into the spinal canal. MRI shows traumatic disc extrusion with caudal migration (red arrow) and spinal stenosis. There is disruption of the posterior ligamentous complex with tear of the ligamentum flavum (blue arrow) and interspinous ligament (green arrow). Note focal fluid signal in the cord at the C7 level (white arrow), which is thought to most likely represent a syrinx. The patient was treated with C5–C6 anterior decompression and fusion. 
• 
Flexion teardrop fracture is the most severe cervical spinal injury that is potentially compatible with life. It is caused by a hyperflexion and compression injury and results in posterior displacement of the affected vertebral body into the spinal canal. 

• 
The posterior ligamentous complex is often disrupted due to distraction from posterior displacement of the vertebral body. 

• 
The key radiographic finding is an avulsed bony fragment from the anterior-inferior aspect of the vertebral body, caused by anterior longitudinal ligament avulsion. There is retropulsion of the affected vertebral body, which is often rotated and appears shorter in anterior-posterior dimension than the adjacent vertebrae. The intact-appearing posterior vertebral body can result in spinal cord injury due to posterior displacement. 

• 
Flexion teardrop fracture can cause anterior cord syndrome due to compression of the pyramidal tracts and anterior spinothalamic tracts. This clinically presents as complete paralysis and loss of pain and temperature sensation. The dorsal column usually remains intact, preserving touch and vibration sense. 



Extension teardrop fracture 

Extension teardrop fracture: Sagittal CT demonstrates a minimally displaced 
fracture of the anterior/inferior corner of C2 (arrow). In contrast to a flexion teardrop fracture, there is 
no retropulsion of the vertebral body. 
• 
In contrast to a flexion teardrop fracture, an extension teardrop fracture is a stable fracture that usually occurs higher in the cervical spine, at C2 or C3. 

• 
On the lateral radiograph, an anterior/inferior avulsion fragment is seen, similar to flexion teardrop. Unlike a flexion teardrop fracture, there is no subluxation and the spinolaminar line is not disrupted. The extension teardrop fracture fragment is typically taller in craniocaudal dimension compared to its anterior-posterior dimension. 

• 
The typical mechanism of an extension teardrop fracture is hyperextension, with fracture resulting from avulsion of the endplate by the anterior longitudinal ligament. 


Clay-shoveler’s fracture 
• 
A clay-shoveler’s fracture is a displaced avulsion fracture of a spinous process. It is caused by forced flexion. 

• 
Clay-shoveler’s fracture occurs in the lower cervical/upper thoracic spine, from C6–T1. 


Bilateral interfacetal dislocation (locked facets) 
• 
Bilateral interfacetal dislocation, also called bilateral locked facets, is a hyperflexion injury caused by complete disruption of all spinal ligaments and resultant anterior dislocation of the affected vertebra by >50%. 

• 
Bilateral interfacetal dislocation is unstable with a high risk of cord damage. 

• 
It typically occurs in the lower cervical spine. 

• 
The naked facet sign is seen when the superior articular facets are not covered by the adjacent inferior articular facets. 

• 
Perched facets are a less severe variation of locked facets. The inferior articular facets of the superior vertebral body are subluxated (but not displaced) and perched upon the superior articular process of the inferior vertebra. Perched facets feature anterior subluxation of >3 mm but less than the 50% seen in a complete dislocation. 



Unilateral interfacetal dislocation 
• 
Unilateral interfacetal dislocation is dislocation of a single facet joint, caused by hyperflexion with rotation opposite the site of the dislocation. 

• 
Unilateral interfacetal dislocation is considered a stable fracture. 



Grisel syndrome 
• Grisel syndrome is nontraumatic rotatory subluxation of the atlantoaxial joint (C1–C2) secondary to an inflammatory mass, most commonly occurring as a sequela of pharyngitis or retropharyngeal abscess. 


Thoracolumbar spine trauma 
Overview of thoracolumbar trauma 
• 
The thoracolumbar injury classification and severity score (TLICS) is similar to SLICS for the cervical (subaxial) spine, and aids in determination of optimal treatment. 

• 
The TLICS provides a numerical score for injury severity based on the same three components of SLICS: injury morphology, integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex (PLC), and neurological status. 

• 
The PLC is a primary stabilizer of the posterior spinal column, and knowledge of its anatomy is helpful to recognize potentially unstable injuries. Indirect imaging findings of PLC injury include widening of the interspinous distance, widening of the facet joints, spinous process fracture, and subluxation or dislocation of a vertebral body. 


Rigid spine trauma 
Sagittal CT 


Rigid spine hyperextension injury in a patient with diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH): 
CT demonstrates marked widening of the T12–L1 disc space (yellow arrows), in keeping with hyperextension injury. Note the tiny retropulsed fracture fragment (red arrow). Multilevel flowing anterior osteophytes are partially seen. 
MRI confirms fluid in the disc space (yellow arrows). There is an epidural hematoma (red arrows) contributing to severe spinal stenosis. There is edema in the region of the anterior longitudinal ligament (blue arrow), consistent with disruption. Note the superior endplate fracture of L1 (green arrow). 
• 
Patients with a rigid spine – due to diffusion idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), ankylosing spondylitis, degenerative change, or surgical fusion, are more vulnerable to fracture given altered biomechanics. 

• 
CT should be performed in a patient with rigid spine and back pain after even minor trauma. 

• 
Hyperextension is the most common injury mechanism. 


Chance fracture 

Sagittal CT Coronal MIP CT Volume-rendered CT 
Chance fracture: There is a minimally displaced transverse fracture through the L1 vertebral body and posterior elements (yellow arrows). Volumetric reconstruction shows the subtle anterior endplate deformity (yellow arrow), with reversal of the spinal curvature centered on the fracture. Interspinous widening (red arrows) indicates posterior ligamentous disruption. 
• 
A Chance fracture, also known as a seat belt fracture, is a flexion distraction injury caused by acute forward flexion of the spine during sudden deceleration. 

• 
There is horizontal splitting of the vertebra which begins posteriorly in the spinous process or lamina and extends anteriorly through the vertebral body. 

• 
Chance fractures are unstable injuries, as they involve all three spinal columns. 

• 
Intra-abdominal injuries are often associated with this fracture pattern, especially in pediatrics. 




AO Spine classification for spinal trauma 
• 
The historical three-column model by Denis classifies spinal fractures morphologically but does not consider the mechanism of injury or patient’s neurological status. 

• 
The cervical subaxial and thoracolumbar injury classification and severity scores (SLIC, TLICS) incorporate neurological status but do not consider patient-specific factors such as underlying medical conditions that may affect management. 

• 
The more comprehensive AO Spine classification system for spinal trauma improved upon previous classification systems by incorporating: 

1) fracture morphology, 
2) neurological status, 
3) clinical modifiers specific to the patient which may influence treatment decisions. 

• 
Examples of clinical modifiers include accompanying injuries that would change treatment (e.g., ligamentous injury resulting in potential instability, vascular injury), high-risk medical comorbidities, and underlying bone disease (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis or DISH resulting in a rigid spine).
