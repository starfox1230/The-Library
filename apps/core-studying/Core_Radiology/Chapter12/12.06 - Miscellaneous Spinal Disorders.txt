Facet septic arthritis 

Axial T2-weighted MRI Sagittal STIR MRI 
Facet septic arthritis: There is prominent edema posterior to the right facet joint (yellow arrows), which is far more conspicuous on the STIR image, as both fat and fluid are similar signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging without fat suppression. Although there is no apparent effusion within the facet joint (red arrow), there is dorsal distension of the capsule evident on the sagittal image (blue arrow). 
• 
Facet septic arthritis is uncommon, but should be considered when the degree of periarticular inflammatory change is out of proportion to a relatively milder degree of degeneration. 

• 
Far more common is active facet arthropathy, which typically demonstrates characteristic imaging features of osteoarthritis including subchondral irregularity, cystic change, and osteophytes. 


Tuberculous osteomyelitis 
• 
Also called Pott disease, tuberculous osteomyelitis is vertebral infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Unlike pyogenic discitis/osteomyelitis, the discs are usually spared as M. tuberculosis lacks the proteolytic enzymes to break down the disc substance. 

• 
Pott disease classically causes wedge-shaped compression of the anterior aspect of the vertebral body, often leading to a gibbus deformity centered at the infected vertebra. Gibbus deformity is an acutely angled kyphosis, which may result from a compression fracture or can 


be seen in congenital syndromes including achondroplasia and the mucopolysaccharidoses (Hunter and Hurler syndromes). 
• Approximately 10% of patients with Pott disease have active pulmonary tuberculosis. 
Miscellaneous spinal disorders 
Extradural spinal metabolic lesions 
Epidural lipomatosis 
• 
Spinal epidural lipomatosis is a nonneoplastic overgrowth of unencapsulated fat in the epidural space, which may cause compression of neural elements. In severe cases, epidural lipomatosis may cause cauda equina syndrome. 

• 
The most common cause of epidural lipomatosis is steroid administration. Other causes include obesity and endogenous Cushing syndrome; some cases are idiopathic. 

• 
MRI shows expansion of the epidural space that follows fat signal on all sequences. While some epidural fat is normal, more than 6 mm in thickness in the mid thoracic level suggests epidural lipomatosis. 



Epidural lipomatosis (continued) 
• Epidural lipomatosis involves multiple vertebral levels and is typically seen posteriorly in the thoracic spine (anterior displacing the thecal sac) and circumferentially in the lumbar spine (creating a trefoil or Y-shaped contour of the thecal sac). 


Ossification of spinal ligaments 
• 
Ossification of the spinal ligaments is a group of conditions in which heterotopic bone formation occurs within the anterior or posterior longitudinal ligaments, ligamentum flavum, or ligamentum nuchae. 

• 
These conditions affect older adults. They are frequently associated/coexistent with each other. They are distinct from but can coexist with degenerative spondylosis. 

• 
Patients are often asymptomatic, but ligamentous ossification can cause issues related to stiffness or mass effect on surrounding structures. 


Ossifi cation of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) 

Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL): 
The right image shows OPLL along the upper to mid cervical spine (arrows). Note partially visualized post-surgical changes of cervical laminectomies and posterior instrumented fusion, which were performed to decompress the spinal stenosis caused by OPLL. 

• 
Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is characterized by bone formation along the posterior longitudinal ligament. 

• 
OPLL most frequently involves the cervical spine, followed by the thoracic spine. 

• 
OPLL contributes to spinal canal stenosis and may compress the anterior aspect of the cord. 


Ossifi cation of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) 
• 
Ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) is characterized by bone formation along the ligamentum flavum. 

• 
OLF predominantly involves the thoracic spine. 

• 
OLF contributes to spinal canal stenosis and may compress the posterior aspect of the cord. 


Ossifi cation of the ligamentum nuchae (OLN) 
• 
Ossification of the nuchal ligament (OLN) is characterized by bone formation along the midline ligament that spans the posterior cervical spine from the external occipital protuberance to the C7 spinous process. 

• 
OLN is generally an incidental finding of no clinical significance. 




Pedicles and pars 
Anatomy 

• 
The pars interarticularis (often simply called pars) is the part of the lamina that lies in between the superior and inferior articular processes of the spine. 

• 
The pedicles connect the vertebral body to the posterior elements. 


Spondylolysis 

Spondylolysis in two different patients: 
Oblique radiograph demonstrates a lucent defect of the pars at L5 (yellow arrow), through the neck of the Scotty dog. Poor Scotty! 
Sagittal CT in a different patient shows a defect of the pars (yellow arrows) with slight L5–S1 anterolisthesis. 

• 
A traumatic or degenerative failure of the pars is known as pars defect or spondylolysis. 

• 
CT is the most definitive imaging modality to diagnose pars defect, as it can be di.cult to see on MR. 

• 
Oblique radiographs of the lumbar spine show the characteristic “Scotty dog” appearance of the posterior elements. Scotty’s neck is the pars interarticularis. This is unfortunate, because it means Scotty becomes decapitated in spondylolysis. Poor Scotty! 

• 
Spondylolysis typically causes anterolisthesis (anterior position of the superior vertebral body, as measured posteriorly). When this occurs, the spinal canal is traditionally widened and the neural foramina become compressed. 



Abnormal pedicles 
• If one pedicle is abnormal and the other pedicle is normal, a lesion may be present. 
Rarely, if one pedicle is sclerotic and the other pedicle is lucent, there may be congenital absence of the pedicle (on the lucent side) with contralateral stress-related changes. 
• If one pedicle is sclerotic and the other pedicle is normal, then a sclerotic lesion may be present, such as metastasis or osteoid osteoma. However, this pattern of a unilateral sclerotic pedicle can also be seen in the setting of unilateral spondylolysis with reactive changes on the opposite side causing sclerosis. 



• If one pedicle is lucent and the other pedicle is normal, then a lytic lesion may be present, such as metastasis, osteoblastoma, or aneurysmal bone cyst. 

Frontal radiograph Axial contrast-enhanced CT (top); Axial T2-weighted 
MRI (bottom) Unilateral lucent pedicle: Radiograph demonstrates an absent right pedicle of an upper-thoracic vertebral body (arrow). CT shows a lytic mass centered at the pedicle (yellow arrow) with extension into the spinal canal. MRI shows a mass with multiple cystic components. There is near complete obliteration of the spinal canal (red arrow). Pathology was an aneurysmal bone cyst with cystic and solid components.
