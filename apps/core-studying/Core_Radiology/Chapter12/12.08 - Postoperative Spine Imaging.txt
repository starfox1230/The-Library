The AO Spine system describes 4 different classifications depending on fracture location: the upper cervical spine, subaxial cervical spine, thoracolumbar spine, and the sacral spine (including coccyx). 

• 
Essentially, fracture morphology is categorized hierarchically with increasing severity and/or instability based on radiologic appearance. While the detailed classifications are beyond the scope of this text, some of the key morphological features in the cervical and thoracolumbar spine are listed below. 

• 
Upper cervical spine injuries (occiput to C2–3 joint): 


Type A: Bony injuries only (stable) Type B: Tension band or ligamentous disruption +/- bony injuries (stable or unstable) Type C: Translation injuries with displacement relative to adjacent vertebrae (unstable) 
Anterior tension band includes the anterior longitudinal ligament. Posterior tension band includes the posterior ligamentous complex. 
• Subaxial cervical spine injuries (C3–C7): 
Type A: Compression fractures without ligamentous injury Type B: Tension band disruption Type C: Translation injuries Type F: Facet joint injuries 
• Thoracolumbar spine injuries: 
Type A: Compression fractures, including wedge compressions and burst fractures 
Type B: Distraction injuries with tension band disruption, including Chance fractures and hyperextension injuries Type C: Translation injuries resulting in displacement and dislocation 
Postoperative spine imaging 
Overview of postoperative spine imaging 
• 
Spine procedures can generally be thought of as falling into one of three categories: stabilization and fusion (for trauma or scoliosis), decompression (typically caused by discovertebral degeneration), and lesion excision. Some surgeries may span two or more of these categories. 

• 
If instrumented fusion is performed, imaging is critical to determine if there is hardware failure (hardware fracture), assess screw position, evaluate for lucency surrounding the screws, and to assess healing of the fusion mass. 

• 
For decompressive surgeries, imaging should also assess if there is a cause for persistent or new pain, such as recurrent disc herniation, scar formation, arachnoiditis, adjacent segment degeneration, or infectious process. 

• 
For lesion excision procedures, signs of lesion recurrence should be carefully evaluated. 

• 
Patients with fusion are at increased risk for fracture due to altered biomechanics.

• 
Spinal hardware may fracture, become loose, or may be malpositioned at time of surgery. 

• 
Lucency surrounding the screws may represent loosening. 


Adjacent segment degeneration 



• 
Adjacent segment degeneration occurs when the level above or below the fused level undergoes degenerative change. 

• 
Adjacent segment degeneration is said to occur at a rate of approximately 3% chance per year. 

• 
Patients with decreased quality of paraspinal muscles are at increased risk for adjacent segment degeneration.

Recurrent disc herniation 

Sagittal T2-weighted MRI Axial post-contrast T1-weighted MRI 
Recurrent disc herniation: MRI demonstrates a heterogeneous signal intensity, predominantly T2 hyperintense disc protrusion at L5–S1 (arrows). Post-contrast MRI confirms that this protrusion enhances peripherally (arrows), confirming recurrent disc herniation rather than scar or granulation tissue. 
• 
In a patient with recurrent pain after decompressive surgery, an intravenous contrast-enhanced MRI can help differentiate between recurrent disc herniation (which may be treated surgically) versus scar and granulation tissue. 

• 
A recurrent disc would not enhance, or would enhance only peripherally. 

• 
Scar tissue and granulation tissue usually enhance homogeneously.
