Extradural lesions 
Overview of extradural lesions 
• 
Extradural lesions are located external to the dura, including the vertebra and epidural space. 

• 
Degenerative lesions, such as osteophytes and herniated discs, are the most common extradural lesions. 

• 
Other important extradural lesions include neoplasms and infection (discitis/osteomyelitis). 

• 
The most common extradural neoplasms that cause epidural spinal cord compression are carcinoma metastases, plasmacytoma/multiple myeloma, and lymphomas. 

• 
Primary extradural tumors are rare. 




Extradural spinal/vertebral neoplasms 
Extradural metastasis 
• 
Metastatic disease is the most common extradural malignancy in adults. Metastases usually involve the vertebra and extend into the epidural space rather than being purely epidural. 

• 
Breast, lung, and prostate are the most common primary tumors to metastasize to the spinal column. 

• 
T1-weighted images are essential for evaluation of vertebral body marrow replacement. Marrow should always be more hyperintense on T1-weighted images than the intervertebral discs. 

• 
Focal decrease in intensity on T1-weighted images is concerning for metastasis. 

• 
Diffuse decrease in intensity on T1-weighted images is abnormal but nonspecific. The differential for diffusely decreased T1 marrow signal includes leukemia, lymphoma, myelofibrosis, HIV, and idiopathic causes. 


Primary extradural tumors in middle-aged and older adults 
• 
Spinal lymphoma most commonly involves the vertebra or epidural space. Secondary spinal involvement is more common than primary bone lymphoma, usually in the form of non-Hodgkin lymphomas like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Lesions are more often osteolytic than sclerotic. 

• 
Solitary plasmacytoma of bone is a lytic, expansile bony lesion of late adulthood that is a precursor of multiple myeloma (which features marrow involvement and end-organ damage). Soft tissue lesions are called solitary extramedullary plasmacytomas. 


The presence of multiple lesions implies the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Development of multiple myeloma, or even abnormal serum/urine protein electrophoresis, may not occur for many years after diagnosis of a plasmacytoma. 
• Chordoma is a malignant tumor of older adults that arises from a notochord remnant. Chordoma occurs most commonly in the sacrococcygeal region and second most commonly in the clivus. Up to 15% may occur in the vertebral bodies (most commonly cervical). 
Chordoma appears as a destructive, hyperintense mass on T2-weighted images. It avidly enhances. 
• Chondrosarcoma is a low-grade malignancy that appears as a hyperintense mass on T2- weighted images, similar to chordoma. Chondroid rings-and-arcs calcification may be seen.

Primary extradural tumors in adolescents and young adults 
• 
Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is a benign, progressively destructive lesion that occurs in adolescents. Fluid levels are typically seen on MRI, though this finding is nonspecific. 

• 
Chondroblastoma is a benign but aggressive neoplasm that rarely may occur in the vertebral column (vertebral body and posterior elements). Secondary ABC may be present. 

• 
Osteoid osteoma is a benign, sclerotic lesion affecting the vertebral posterior elements in teenagers and young adults, with a classic clinical history of nocturnal pain relieved by NSAIDs. A central radiolucent nidus consists of vascular fibrous connecting tissue. 

• 
Osteosarcoma is a malignant tumor that typically produces osteoid matrix. 


Hemangioma 
• 
Vertebral hemangiomas are technically not neoplasms but low-flow vascular malformations, predominantly the cavernous type. They are the most common benign “tumor” of the spine. They are usually incidentally found and composed of endothelium-lined vascular structures. 

• 
Destruction of some of the bony trabeculae and thickening of the remaining trabeculae produce the characteristic striated corduroy appearance on plain radiographs and sagittal/ coronal CT. The stippled appearance on axial CT is produced by thickened trabeculae seen in cross-section. 

• 
Hemangioma is typically hyperintense on both T1- and T2-weighted images. 

• 
Although hemangioma is benign, an aggressive variant is occasionally seen in the thoracic spine. The aggressive variant may have an epidural soft tissue component that has the potential to cause cord compression. 


Although the asymptomatic variant has no sex predilection, the aggressive form of hemangioma is more common in females. 

Extradural non-neoplastic lesions 
Disc degeneration 
• 
In the vast majority of cases, diagnosing disc degeneration, including bulges and protrusions, is not a diagnostic dilemma (although accurately characterizing and describing such lesions can be challenging even for experienced radiologists!). 

• 
However, occasionally a sequestered disc fragment may appear like an extradural mass. In fact, since "funny looking" disc fragments are far more common than extradural tumors, a extradural mass within the spinal canal is most likely to represent a sequestered disc fragment. A contrast-enhanced exam can be very helpful to differentiate disc fragment (generally non-enhancing) from a tumor (typically enhancing). 



Sequestered disc: 
Sagittal T2-weighted MRI demonstrates an extradural mass (arrow) posterior to the inferior endplate of a mid-lumbar vertebral body. 
Despite having different signal intensity from the parent disc, this was a sequestered disc fragment.
