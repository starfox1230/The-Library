Spine infection 
Overview of spine infection and relevant anatomy 

• 
Spine infection can be a confusing topic, as there are different etiologies, myriad imaging manifestations, and confounding differential diagnoses. Patients with diabetes, drug abuse, or prior spinal surgery are at increased risk of spine infection. 

• 
It can be helpful to think of spine infection in terms of “compartments” (illustrated above) including the retroperitoneum/psoas, discs and vertebral bodies, epidural space, and facet joints. Infection may originate in any of these compartments and spread to adjacent compartments. 


Discitis/osteomyelitis 
• 
Discitis/osteomyelitis is infection of the disc-endplate complex. Hematogeneous spread is the most common etiology. 

• 
In adults, the disc is not vascularized, but the endplates are supplied by end-capillary branches of the segmental lumbar arteries, as illustrated to the right. A single artery supplies two segmental endplates, although usually only one endplate is infected first.  

• 
Hematogeneous infection in adults starts in the endplate, and can spread to the adjacent vertebral body through the disc. 

• 
In contrast, in children, the disc is directly vascularized and can act as the nidus for infection.

Discitis/osteomyelitis (continued) 

Discitis/osteomyelitis: MRI demonstrates enhancement at the left aspect of the L3–L4 disc (yellow arrow). There is enhancing osteitis of the adjacent endplates (red arrows), and prominent inflammatory change involving the left psoas (blue arrows). CT shows osseous erosion of the endplates (red arrows). 
• 
MR is the optimal imaging modality for suspected discitis/osteomyelitis. 

• 
The most sensitive MR imaging sign to detect spinal infection is paraspinal or epidural inflammatory change. 

• 
Other imaging findings include erosion or destruction of the vertebral endplates, disc enhancement, fluid signal and/or enhancement of the disc, and edema evident across the disc space (although this last finding is nonspecific in the absence of other signs/symptoms or imaging findings of infection). In advanced cases there may be frank osseous destruction.

Epidural infection 

Epidural infection: 
Illustration demonstrates infection of the epidural space. In this illustration, the infection is seen circumferentially surrounding the dura. 

Sagittal STIR MRI Sagittal post-contrast T1-weighted MRI with fat sat. 
Epidural phlegmon, epidural abscess, and discitis/ osteomyelitis: 
There is edema and enhancing osteitis across L5– S1 (yellow arrows). Note the marked subchondral irregularity of the L5–S1 endplates best appreciated on the sagittal T1-weighted image. There is prominent anterior epidural enhancement seen on the sagittal image (red arrows). The axial T1-weighted MRI without fat suppression shows a subtle non-enhancing abscess (blue arrow) just posterior/medial to the left S1 nerve root (green arrow). 
• 
Infection in the epidural space may be caused by phlegmon or abscess. An abscess is centrally necrotic, although either may exert mass effect upon the nerve roots or spinal cord. 

• 
Given that normal epidural fat is hyperintense on T1-weighted images, fat suppression is an extremely helpful technique to detect early epidural infection.
