• 
The first step in evaluation of any spinal mass is to determine its compartment of origin: intramedullary (within the substance of the spinal cord), intradural extramedullary (within the thecal sac but outside the cord), or extradural (outside the thecal sac). 

• 
Note that epidural is extradural in location. 



Intramedullary lesions 
Overview of intramedullary lesions 
• 
Intramedullary lesions are located within the substance of the cord, deep to the pia and are, by definition, also intradural. 

• 
Neoplasms frequently expand the spinal cord, whereas non-neoplastic etiologies more likely cause nonexpansile signal changes. 

• 
Astrocytomas and ependymomas comprise 90% of intramedullary tumors and cannot be reliably differentiated based on imaging features. 

• 
Hemangioblastomas and intramedullary metastases are less common. 




Intramedullary spinal cord neoplasms 
Astrocytoma 

Sagittal T2-weighted (left image) and T1-weighted post-contrast (right image) MRI shows an intramedullary mass in the thoracic spine (yellow arrows) which expands the spinal cord and causes cord signal abnormality from the mid thoracic spine down. A focus of hypointensity on the T2-weighted image at the inferior aspect of the lesion may represent hemorrhagic material (red arrow). On the post-contrast image, the mass demonstrates wispy enhancement inferiorly (blue arrow). This was an astrocytoma. 
• 
Astrocytomas are the most common intramedullary tumor in children and second most common in adults. They are associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (along with neurofibromas). 

• 
Most spinal astrocytomas are low-grade (WHO grade I or II). Spinal glioblastoma (WHO grade IV) is rare. 

• 
Astrocytomas have ill-defined (infiltrative) margins and can have patchy or irregular enhancement. Cystic components are seen in a minority and a syrinx may be present. Hemorrhage is uncommon. 



Ependymoma 
• 
Ependymomas are the most common intramedullary tumor in adults and second most common in children. They are associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 (along with schwannomas and meningiomas). 

• 
Most are low-grade (WHO grade II). Myxopapillary ependymoma (WHO grade I) is frequently intradural-extramedullary with distinct prognosis and imaging appearances (discussed separately in the next section). 

• 
Ependymomas have well-defined margins and intense, heterogeneous enhancement. Cystic components are seen in up to half (more commonly polar/nontumoral than intratumoral) and a syrinx may be present. Hemorrhage is common, resulting in the hemosiderin cap sign (hypointense poles on T2-weighted images). 


Hemangioblastoma 
• 
Spinal hemangioblastomas are uncommon benign (WHO grade I) tumors in adults. They are associated with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, which should be suspected when there are multiple lesions in the neuraxis (most commonly involving spinal cord, retina, and cerebellum). 

• 
Although usually intramedullary, they tend to be superficially and posteriorly located in the cord and may have an exophytic (intradural extramedullary) component, as if arising from the linings of pial vessels. 

• 
Hemangioblastomas have well-defined margins and intense, homogeneous enhancement. They are typically small (involving only one vertebral level). Larger lesions can show vascular flow voids, cystic components, or a syrinx. Surrounding edema may also be seen. 



Metastasis 
• 
Intramedullary metastases are rare compared to primary intramedullary tumors and to leptomeningeal or epidural metastases of the spine. Concurrent metastatic disease elsewhere is common. 

• 
Lung cancer is the most common metastasis and breast cancer is the second most common. 

• 
Intramedullary metastases usually have well-defined margins and enhance. Specific signs include the rim sign (more intense enhancement peripherally than centrally) and .ame sign (ill-defined triangular enhancement projecting from the superior/inferior margin). Cystic/ necrotic components and hemorrhage are rare. Surrounding edema is often extensive. 

• 
Intramedullary metastases typically involve a short segment of cord (one to two vertebral levels). They are usually solitary rather than multiple. 



spinal cord inflammatory/infectious lesions 

MS: Multiple sclerosis 
NMO: Neuromyelitis optica 
anti-MOG associated myelitis: A newly recognized inflammatory demyelinating disorder caused by anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (anti-MOG) antibodies. 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) 

Sagittal STIR (left image) and axial T2 (right images) MRI show multiple T2 hyperintense lesions (arrows) within the visualized spinal cord, predominantly in the central cord, in this patient with known MS. 
• 
The spinal cord is one of four areas of the CNS where lesions count towards the 2017 McDonald criteria for demonstration of dissemination in space (in addition to periventricular, cortical or juxtacortical, and infratentorial brain). The cervical cord is most commonly involved. 

• 
Typical spinal MS lesions appear as focal hyperintensity on T2-weighted images (visible in two planes) that are short (one or two vertebral segments), peripherally located, and occupying the minority of the cord in cross-section. 

• 
An active MS lesion may enhance and mimic a spinal tumor, but MS is often distinguishable from a neoplasm by the absence of cord expansion (analogous to the absence of significant mass effect that is typical of intracranial tumefactive MS), multifocality involving the brain and spine, as well as CSF oligoclonal bands. 

• 
MS affecting the rest of the CNS is discussed in the previous chapter. 


Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) 
• 
ADEM is an uncommon demyelinating disorder with an acute monophasic course that typically follows a viral infection or vaccination. It usually occurs in children. 

• 
Spinal cord involvement occurs in a minority of cases, characterized by multifocal or large confluent, T2 hyperintense, intramedullary lesions with cord swelling and variable enhancement. 



Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) 
• NMOSD is an uncommon demyelinating disorder associated with serum antibodies against aquaporin-4. Acute longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis is a core clinical characteristic, along with optic neuritis, area postrema syndrome (hiccups, nausea/ vomiting), and other syndromes involving brainstem, diencephalic, and cerebral lesions. 

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD; continued) 
• 
Typical NMOSD myelitis lesions are T2-hyperintense (“bright spotty lesion” with areas more hyperintense than CSF), longitudinally extensive (extending >3 contiguous vertebral segments), and transversally extensive (involving a majority of the cord in cross-section). Cord swelling and patchy or ring-enhancement occurs in the acute phase, followed by atrophy after treatment. The cervicothoracic cord is predominantly involved. 

• 
Typical NMOSD optic neuritis appears as T2-hyperintense or enhancing lesions extending over more than half of the optic nerve length. The posterior optic nerve is predominantly involved, usually bilaterally and extending to the optic chiasm. 

• 
Less commonly, brain lesions can occur in NMOSD, predominantly distributed in periependymal areas such as the area postrema (dorsal medulla), ventricles, and cerebral aqueduct. 


Anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody-associated disease 
• 
Anti-MOG IgG antibody-associated disease overlaps clinically with NMOSD, presenting as optic neuritis and/or myelitis. Patients are seronegative for aquaporin-4 antibodies. 

• 
Spinal cord lesions are T2 hyperintense, longitudinally extensive, and transversally extensive, similar to those in NMOSD. However, the thoracolumbar cord including conus medullaris is preferentially involved. 

• 
Optic nerve lesions demonstrate extensive bilateral T2 hyperintensity, as with NMOSD. However, the anterior optic nerve is preferentially involved and there may be associated perioptic nerve sheath enhancement. 

• 
Brain MRI is normal in most cases but sometimes shows lesions in deep gray matter (basal ganglia, thalami) and infratentorial regions (pons and cerebellar peduncles), with patchy “cloud-like” enhancement. 



Transverse myelitis 
• 
Transverse myelitis is the clinical syndrome of acute or subacute neurologic dysfunction (sensory, motor, or autonomic) below the level of an inflammatory spinal cord lesion. 

• 
Transverse myelitis can be idiopathic/isolated or a part of other diseases such as MS, ADEM, NMOSD, anti-MOG antibody-associated disease, CNS infection, sarcoidosis, and connective tissue diseases (e.g. lupus). 

• 
Imaging findings include spinal cord enlargement with edema and patchy enhancement. 


Acute flaccid myelitis 
• 
Acute flaccid myelitis is a polio-like illness of children, presenting with a viral prodrome followed by rapid onset weakness in a lower motor neuron pattern. Outbreaks of enterovirus D68 are implicated. 

• 
MRI demonstrates T2 prolongation within the spinal cord gray matter spanning =1 vertebral segments. 


Spinal cord abscess 

Spinal cord abscess: Sagittal T2 (left image), T1 pre-contrast (middle image), and T1 post-contrast (right image) MRI demonstrate an elongated area of abnormal intramedullary signal in the lower cervical spinal cord with heterogeneous high T2 and low T1 signal (yellow arrows), and peripheral enhancement after gadolinium administration (red arrows). There is associated cord edema extending superiorly and inferiorly, and cord expansion. Note post-surgical changes of cervical laminectomies and posterior instrumented fusion. 
• 
Spinal cord abscess is rare and mostly from hematogenous infection. It initially presents as an ill-defined myelitis and gradually evolves to a localized abscess. 

• 
Like abscesses elsewhere, these appear as a T2 hyperintense, peripherally enhancing collection with central diffusion restriction. 



HIV vacuolar myelopathy 
• 
Vacuolar myelopathy occurs in patients in late stages of AIDS and is characterized by vacuolation in the spinal white matter associated with lipid-laden macrophages. 

• 
MRI demonstrates thoracic (and possibly cervical) cord atrophy and T2 prolongation preferentially involving the dorsal columns and lateral corticospinal tracts. 



Tabes dorsalis 
• 
Tabes dorsalis, a form of tertiary neurosyphilis, is characterized by demyelination of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord. 

• 
MRI demonstrates longitudinal T2 prolongation in the dorsal columns, for which the differential diagnosis includes subacute combined degeneration (see later in this chapter). 



Neurosarcoidosis 
• 
Intramedullary neurosarcoidosis occurs as a result from infiltration of the Virchow-Robin spaces and can present as diffuse T2 prolongation with associated cord enlargement. 

• 
Intramedullary involvement is frequently seen with diffuse or nodular leptomeningeal enhancement.

• Spinal cord infarction is most common in the upper thoracic or thoracolumbar spine due to more precarious blood supply. The predominant blood supply to the distal cord is the artery of Adamkiewicz, which commonly originates from a branch of the intercostal or lumbar artery on the left at level of T9–12. 
Spinal cord infarction (continued) 
• 
Spinal cord infarction clinically presents with loss of bowel and bladder control, loss of perineal sensation, and impairment in both motor and sensory function of the legs. 

• 
Risk factors for spinal cord infarction include aortic surgery, aortic aneurysm, arteritis, sickle cell anemia, vascular malformation, and disc herniation. 

• 
Imaging of spinal cord infarction shows hyperintensity of the affected cord regions on T2- weighted images. The cord may be enlarged and typically shows restricted diffusion. 

• 
Concomitant vertebral body infarction may be present, which is more common in sickle cell disease and chronic steroid use. 


High-flow vascular (arteriovenous) malformation 

Sagittal T2 MRI (left image) shows subtle flow voids dorsal to the thoracic spinal cord (yellow arrows). Coronal TWIST MRA subtraction image (middle) demonstrates serperginous vessels in the dorsal spinal canal (red arrows). Coronal oblique digital subtraction angiogram (right image) following injection of contrast into the left T11 segmental artery shows early opacification of an engorged and tortuous dorsal spinal vein (blue arrows). These findings are consistent with a type I dural spinal AV fistula arising from the left T11 segmental artery. 
• 
Dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVF) are the most common spinal vascular malformations. They are high-flow vascular malformations characterized angiographically by a radiculomeningeal feeding artery, no intervening nidus, and radicular vein at the nerve root sheath just under the pedicle draining retrograde to perimedullary veins. 

• 
The resulting venous hypertension causes progressive congestive myelopathy. It typically presents in older males. 

• 
MRI of dAVF often shows a long segment of edema in the cord (+/– mild cord expansion) and surrounding intradural extramedullary vascular flow voids representing dilated perimedullary veins. CT myelography shows serpentine intradural filling defects. 

• 
Dural AVF may  be occult on CTA and MRA, and it may need to be diagnosed with catheter angiography based on clinical symptoms or presence of brain or spinal hemorrhage. 

• 
Foix-Alajouanine myelopathy is the eponym of the congestive myelopathy caused by dAVF. 

• 
Less common spinal high-flow vascular malformations include intramedullary glomus arteriovenous malformation (AVM; nidus within spinal cord), juvenile/metameric AVM (multiple pial/dural/extradural feeding arteries, large nidus within spinal cord and possibly bone or soft tissues), and pial AVF (anterior or posterior spinal artery feeder). 


Low-flow vascular (cavernous) malformation 
• 
Spinal cavernous malformations (cavernomas) are rare and sometimes associated with cerebral cavernous malformations. The imaging findings are identical to their intracranial counterparts. 

• 
Cavernous malformations are typically small (involving only one vertebral level). They are most commonly located in the thoracic cord, followed by the cervical cord.

Dorsal columns 

HIV Syphilis (tabes dorsalis) Copper deÿciency Nitrous oxide toxicity 
Subacute combined degeneration (SCD) 
• 
Subacute combined degeneration is a myelopathy involving the dorsal and lateral columns caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. 

• 
Causes include malabsorption (e.g., pernicious anemia, gastrointestinal surgery), inadequate intake (strict vegetarian diet), or interfering drugs (e.g., nitrous oxide, proton pump inhibitors, metformin). 

• 
Imaging findings include longitudinal, symmetric hyperintensity on T2-weighted images primarily in the dorsal columns, configured like an inverted V in the axial plane. Lesions involve the cervical and/or thoracic cord. 

• 
With treatment, these findings can regress. Chronically, permanent axonal loss results with associated gliosis. 


Radiation myelopathy 
• 
Radiation myelitis/myelopathy is spinal cord white matter injury that develops some time after exposure to radiation therapy. 

• 
MRI demonstrates longitudinally extensive cord hyperintensity on T2-weighted images in the field of radiation therapy, which may be demarcated by T1 hyperintensity of the adjacent vertebrae. 


Spinal cord mechanical/traumatic/miscellaneous lesions 
Syrinx (syringohydromyelia) 
• 
Syrinx and syringohydromyelia are collective terms referring to intramedullary cystic lesions that may represent hydromyelia and/or syringomyelia. Syrinx may rarely also refer to intracranial variants. 

• 
Syringomyelia is a fluid-filled, gliosis-lined cavity within the spinal cord parenchyma that does not communicate with the central canal. 

• 
Hydromyelia is dilatation of the ependymal cell-lined central canal (>2 mm). 

• 
The most common congenital cause is Chiari malformations (more often Chiari I). Other congenital causes include spinal dysraphisms (myelomeningocele, tethered cord syndrome) and Klippel-Feil syndrome. 

• 
Acquired causes include hydrocephalus, post-infectious, post-inflammatory, post-traumatic, and intramedullary tumors (particularly ependymomas and hemangioblastomas). 

• 
Of note, minimal dilation of the central canal of less than 2 mm is likely within normal limits. 


Compressive myelopathy 
• 
Compressive myelopathy refers to neurological deficits related to spinal cord compression. 

• 
The most common cause is degenerative disease (spondylosis) in the cervical spine. Other causes include extradural masses. 

• 
MRI demonstrates T2 prolongation within the compressed segment of cord. 


Traumatic spinal cord injury 
• MRI is useful to evaluate severity of traumatic injury to the spinal cord and provide prognosis for functional outcome. Injury can manifest as concussion (normal MRI appearance), cord edema, hemorrhagic contusion, or cord hematoma. 
Spinal cord edema is characterized by abnormal T2 prolongation within the spinal cord, with normal or 
low associated T1 signal. Hemorrhagic contusion appears as a focus of hypointensity surrounded by hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. 
Cord hematoma (poorest prognosis) is a larger (>4 mm) focus of hypointensity surrounded by hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. 
• Spinal cord injury is neurologically categorized by whether there is incomplete or complete sensory and/or motor function loss below a particular level. There are several classic incomplete cord syndromes: 
Central cord syndrome, due to injury around the central canal, is the most common incomplete cord syndrome and usually results from hyperextension trauma in patients with degenerative cervical spinal canal stenosis. 
Brown-Séquard syndrome, due to a hemicord injury, usually results from penetrating trauma affecting 
half the cord. Ventral/anterior cord syndrome, involving the anterior 2/3 of the cord but sparing dorsal columns, is most commonly caused by anterior spinal artery ischemia/infarction, but can also be post-traumatic due to vertebral fracture, disc herniation, or spondylolisthesis. 
Conus medullaris and cauda equina syndromes, due to a lesion at the end of the spinal cord or nerve roots at T12 and below, have various causes including trauma, disc herniation, tumor, and epidural abscess.
