Imaging implants 
Overview of implants 
• 
Implants can be used either for cosmetic reasons or for breast reconstruction after mastectomy. The two types of implants in common use are filled with either silicone or saline, although double lumen (inner silicone lumen and outer saline compartment) and other varieties of implants exist. 

• 
Silicone implants are comprised of a silicone gel and come in pre-manufactured sizes. Saline implants contain a valve that allows filling of the implant during surgery. 

• 
Regardless of the type of implant, a fibrous capsule is gradually formed as a reaction to the foreign body. The capsule may become calcified. Over time, the implant may partially herniate through the capsule without rupturing, causing a palpable contour deformity. 

• 
Implants can be placed either behind the pectoralis (retropectoral) or directly in front of the pectoralis/behind the fibroglandular tissue (prepectoral/retroglandular). 


Mammographic imaging of implants 
• 
When implants are imaged with mammography, standard views are difficult to interpret because the high-attenuation implant can obscure breast tissue. Implant-displaced views (also called Eklund views) displace the implant posteriorly and pull the native breast tissue anteriorly to allow for improved compression and visualization of the breast tissue. 

• 
A saline implant can be identified on mammography due to the presence of its valve. Additionally, the wall of the implant will be denser than the center because the wall is made 


of silicone elastomer that is denser than saline. 
• In contrast, a silicone implant will be uniformly dense, and no valve will be present. 
Ultrasound imaging of implants 
• While ultrasound probes designed specifically for breast imaging provide superior imaging of the breast tissue, they do not always allow sufficient penetration to fully evaluate a more posteriorly positioned implant. An ultrasound machine with multiple probe choices is therefore advantageous in the setting of implant evaluation. 
MR imaging of silicone implants 
• 
Specific MRI protocols allow for the evaluation of implants, including silicone-only and silicone-suppression sequences. 

• 
MRI has a higher sensitivity and specificity for detecting silicone implant rupture than both mammogram and ultrasound.

Overview of implant rupture (continued) 
• 
Rupture of an implant can be contained within the fibrous capsule (intracapsular rupture) or may extend out of the fibrous capsule (extracapsular rupture). 

• 
The distinction between intra- and extracapsular rupture is only important for silicone implants. The contents of a saline implant will leak out even if the fibrous capsule remains 


intact. 

Intracapsular silicone implant rupture 
• 
Intracapsular rupture of a silicone implant may manifest clinically as a subtle change in the implant contour but without significant change in the size or even shape of the breast. Rupture of a silicone implant can be challenging to diagnose clinically. 

• 
Mammography is often normal, and ultrasound or MRI is usually necessary to diagnose silicone implant rupture. 

• 
MRI of intracapsular silicone implant rupture can have several appearances: 


Linguine sign is the most classic and describes the presence of multiple curvilinear lines representing the fragmented and collapsed  elastomer shell that is floating within the intracapsular silicone. 
Subcapsular line sign describes a thin layer of silicone interposed between the implant shell and fibrous 
capsule. 
Keyhole and teardrop signs describe focal invagination of the implant shell due to leaked silicone outside the shell. 
• 
Radial folds are normal infoldings of the implant shell that can mimic implant rupture. 

• 
Ultrasound of intracapsular silicone implant rupture may show segments of broken and collapsed implant shell floating within intracapsular silicone at various levels, termed the 


stepladder sign. 

Left: Axial T2-weighted MRI of the left breast without fat saturation shows the curvilinear undulating contour of the disrupted and collapsed silicone implant shell (arrow), representing the linguine sign. 
Right: Ultrasound shows a stepladder pattern of the echogenic silicone implant shell (arrows). The implant envelope is floating within a lake of fluid containing low-level internal echoes, representing silicone. 

Extracapsular silicone implant rupture 
• Extracapsular rupture of a silicone implant may be evident on mammography as high density silicone extending beyond the edge of the capsule into the breast parenchyma. 

Extracapsular rupture: Standard MLO mammogram (left image) shows a retropectoral implant and frank extravasation of high density silicone into the breast parenchyma (arrows). The implant-displaced CC mammogram better shows the extent of the high density intraparenchymal silicone granulomas. 
• 
On ultrasound, extracapsular silicone rupture causes free silicone to appear in the breast parenchyma, which has a classic snowstorm appearance on ultrasound. 

• 
Silicone uptake by regional nodes can occur with free silicone injection, extracapsular rupture and much less commonly with intracapsular rupture or gel bleed through an intact but weakened implant shell. 



Ultrasound shows an echogenic, shadowing 
mass with a classic snowstorm appearance 
(calipers), suggestive of silicone granuloma from extracapsular rupture. 

Saline implant rupture 
• Rupture of a saline implant 
is usually evident clinically. 
Rupture causes sudden

Reduction mammoplasty 
Reduction mammoplasty 

Reduction mammoplasty: Bilateral CC (left images) and MLO mammograms show subtle skin thickening of the lower medial breasts (yellow arrows). Symmetric distortion of the fibroglandular tissue (red arrows) in the lower breast is best seen on the MLO views. The nipples are superiorly displaced. 
• 
Reduction mammoplasty is performed for aesthetic reasons or to reduce back pain caused by large breasts. 

• 
The surgeon removes breast parenchyma and skin from the inferior breast and relocates the nipple to a more superior location. 

• 
The mammographic findings of reduction mammoplasty include: 


Elevation of the nipple. Redistribution of breast tissue to the lower breast. Curvilinear architectural distortion in the lower breast. 
Postsurgical skin thickening over the areola and lower breast. 
Fat necrosis, suture and dermal calcifications may be present.
