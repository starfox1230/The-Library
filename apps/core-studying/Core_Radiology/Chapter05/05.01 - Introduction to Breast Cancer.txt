Introduction to breast cancer 
Key facts and imaging modalities 
• Breast cancer is the most common female cancer in the United States. The average woman 
has a one in eight chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer during her lifetime. 
• Mammography is the first-line tool for detection of breast cancer. The sensitivity of screening mammography for detecting cancer has been estimated at between 68% and 90%. Diagnostic mammography has a higher sensitivity, up to 93%. 
Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is becoming the standard of care for breast cancer screening and diagnostic imaging. Compared to digital mammography, DBT decreases recall rate and increases cancer detection rate. 
• Ultrasound is a critical adjunct to diagnostic mammography, and an important tool in further evaluation of symptomatic patients when mammography is negative. Use of whole breast ultrasound as a supplemental screening tool (in addition to mammography) is more controversial; it can detect an additional 2–4 cancers per 1,000 women over mammography alone, but at the cost of increased intervention. 
Indications for breast ultrasound are characterization of palpable abnormalities, further characterization of mammographic findings, first-line evaluation of a breast abnormality in a young (under age 30), pregnant, or lactating woman, guidance for interventional procedures, and evaluation of breast implants. As mentioned above, it is also used in some settings as supplemental screening in women with dense 
breasts or those at high risk unable to undergo MRI surveillance. 
• MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality for breast cancer detection and is the most definitive imaging modality in evaluation of implant integrity. Indications for breast MRI include screening in high-risk patients (greater than 20% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer), evaluation of extent of disease in a patient newly diagnosed with breast cancer, evaluation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy response, assessment for residual disease after positive surgical 
margins or for tumor recurrence after breast conserving treatment, evaluation for occult breast cancer in a patient with axillary metastases and for assessment of breast implants. 
Pathway of invasive ductal breast cancer progression 
• The current understanding of progression of ductal breast cancer is a multi-step transformation from normal cells to flat epithelial atypia (FEA), to atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). 

Although controversial, it has been suggested that some steps in this pathway may be reversible. 
• 
FEA is a low-grade form of atypia involving the breast acini; it is seen in 3–5% of core needle biopsies and usually presents as grouped amorphous or punctate calcifications. 

• 
ADH is a proliferation of intraductal luminal cells and represents a greater degree of atypia, differing from DCIS only in extent or lack of certain architectural features. It is seen in 4–14% of core biopsies and also typically presents as calcifications. 

• 
FEA and ADH are considered non-obligatory precursor lesions, meaning they sometimes,  but not always, progress to ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive ductal cancer. Both increase a woman’s risk for subsequent breast cancer, FEA, likely 3 times the general population and ADH 4–5 times the general population 

• 
Upstaging (or upgrading) refers to the diagnosis of a higher grade malignant lesion (such as DCIS or IDC) following surgical excision than initially diagnosed by core needle biopsy. 

• 
Management of the above high-risk lesions when identified at core needle biopsy is related to the upstage rate. For example, the upstage rate for ADH is relatively high (up to 20%), therefore surgical excision is recommended. The upstage rate for the other entities are still under investigation, and therefore different institutions may recommend excision versus 


surveillance. 

Risk factors for developing breast cancer 
• 
The two most important risk factors for breast cancer are female sex and advancing age. 

• 
Inherited BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Women with an inherited mutation have greater than 50% chance (some believe as high as 80% chance) of developing breast cancer by age 80. 

• 
First degree relative with breast cancer. In contrast, a non-first degree relative with 


postmenopausal breast cancer is not considered an increased risk. 
• Prior chest radiation for Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 
• Prior biopsy result of one of the following high-risk lesions: Atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) Flat epithelial aplasia (FEA) Radial scar 
Intraductal papilloma/atypical papilloma 
• Long-term estrogen exposure, such as early menarche, late menopause, late first pregnancy, nulliparity, or obesity (through increased estrogen production by adipocytes). 

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) 
• 
DCIS represents carcinoma contained within the duct with an intact basement membrane in place (once tumor cells have broken through the basement membrane invasive disease is present). It represents the lowest stage of breast cancer, Stage 0. 

• 
DCIS is the most frequent occult cancer detected mammographically, accounting for approximately 20% of new cancer diagnoses and usually presents mammographically as calcifications. Much less frequently DCIS presents as mammographic asymmetry, mass or architectural distortion. It is most often asymptomatic, but may present as nipple discharge, nipple changes or infrequently as a palpable mass. 

• 
On MRI, a pattern of linear or segmental, clumped enhancement is suspicious for DCIS. 

• 
Pathologically, DCIS is graded as low, intermediate or high grade. High grade DCIS is more likely to progress to invasive disease if not adequately treated. 



Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) 
• 
Breast cancer is a diverse spectrum of disease with varying histopathology and prognosis. 

• 
The most common subtype of breast cancer is invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), representing 70–80% of cases. It often presents as a palpable mass, with the classic associated 


mammographic appearance being an irregular mass with spiculated margins and associated 
pleomorphic calcifications. 
• Basal-type breast carcinoma is a phenotype given to triple (ER, PR, and HER2/neu) negative carcinomas due to gene underexpression. This phenotype includes various morphologic types including medullary carcinoma and invasive carcinoma in the setting of BRCA1 mutation. Although these tumors are usually high grade, basal-like breast carcinomas have been associated with favorable response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
Invasive ductal carcinoma (continued) 

Left mammographic image shows an irregular mass with spiculated margins and associated calcifications (not well seen at this resolution); this was found to be invasive ductal carcinoma. Right mammographic image shows grouped calcifications (arrows) in the same breast at a separate location; biopsy showed DCIS. 
• Combined, a number of less common subtypes make up <10% of all breast cancers. Some of these special subtypes have better prognosis than IDC NOS (not otherwise specified). 
special histologic subtypes of IDC with favorable prognosis 
• 
Tubular carcinoma is a low-grade cancer that typically presents as architectural distortion or a small spiculated mass and accounts for <2% of invasive ductal cancers. 

• 
Mucinous carcinoma (synonyms: colloid carcinoma, mucoid carcinoma, and gelatinous carcinoma) accounts for approximately 2% of breast cancers and is more common in older women. It often presents as a circumscribed mass on mammography. It can show acoustic enhancement on ultrasound and high T2 signal intensity on MRI, features which might 


cause it to be confused with a benign lesion. 
• 
Medullary carcinoma accounts for <5% of breast cancer and is typically seen in younger women, often with BRCA1 mutation. It frequently presents as a more circumscribed mass on mammography and ultrasound. Despite its classification as a basal-like triple negative breast cancer, medullary carcinoma has a favorable prognosis. 

• 
Encapsulated papillary carcinoma/solid papillary carcinoma accounts for <2% of breast cancer and is most common in older women (average onset age 69.5 years). It may present clinically as a palpable mass or nipple discharge. It often appears mammographically as a round or oval mass with predominantly circumscribed margins. Ultrasound shows a complex cystic and solid mass in the setting of encapsulated papillary carcinoma. 

• 
Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a variant of adenocarcinoma typically seen in the salivary gland, but very rarely occurs in the breast (<0.1% of all breast cancers). Mammographic appearances can include an irregular mass, distortion or asymmetry. 



Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) 
• 
Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) comprises approximately 5–10% of breast cancer cases. 

• 
Compared to invasive ductal carcinoma, invasive lobular is typically much more difficult to diagnose mammographically and clinically due to its tendency to spread through the breast tissue without forming a discrete mass. 

• 
ILC presents an imaging challenge due to its elusive appearance, which ranges from a one-view asymmetry to architectural distortion to a spiculated mass. 


Inflammatory carcinoma 
• 
Inflammatory carcinoma is a very aggressive form of breast cancer that represents tumor invasion of dermal lymphatics; it carries a poor prognosis. 

• 
Clinically, inflammatory carcinoma presents with breast erythema, edema, and firmness, often referred to as a peau d’orange or orange peel appearance. 



Inflammatory carcinoma (continued) 
• On mammography, the affected breast is larger and denser, with trabecular thickening  and skin thickening. Occasionally, no discrete mass will be apparent. The primary differential consideration is mastitis, which can often be differentiated in the clinical setting. 


Paget disease of the nipple 
• Paget disease of the nipple is 
a form of DCIS that infiltrates 
the epidermis of the nipple. 
• Clinically, Paget disease of the nipple presents with 
erythema, ulceration, and eczematoid changes of the 
nipple. 


Breast cancer prognosis 
• In non-metastatic invasive breast cancer, axillary lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor, with the absence of nodal involvement offering the highest likelihood of cure. Survival is progressively worse with increased number of involved axillary nodes. 
The primary method to detect axillary involvement is a surgical sentinel lymph node biopsy, with a sensitivity of 93%. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is not routinely performed for DCIS unless necrosis or 
microinvasive disease is present. 
Alternatively, surgical axillary lymph node dissection has a 99% sensitivity for detecting lymph node involvement. Lymph node dissection is performed if the sentinel lymph node is positive or not identified. Women with positive lymph nodes or with large tumors may benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
• The presence of tumor receptors affects prognosis. Patients with estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) positive tumors have longer disease-free survival. 
Cancers with HER2/neu overexpression may respond to the monoclonal antibody trastuzamab (brand name Herceptin) or tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as lapatinib. 
• Triple-negative cancers are ER, PR, and HER2/neu negative, and the majority are biologically aggressive with poor prognosis. Triple-negative cancers account for the majority of breast cancers in patients with BRCA1 mutation. On imaging, they may show features more typical 
of benign lesions despite their aggressive nature. 

Tomosynthesis (left image) and targeted ultrasound (right image) show a large oval, circumscribed mass with heterogeneous echotexture and posterior acoustic enhancement (not shown). Although these are typically benign mammographic and sonographic features, this mass also demonstrated internal vascularity on Doppler imaging and had rapid growth per patient history, prompting a biopsy which showed triple-negative invasive 
ductal carcinoma.
