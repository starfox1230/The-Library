Subcutaneous zone and skin lesions 
• 
The subcutaneous (premammary) zone of the breast contains skin and dermis, subcutaneous fat, and some suspensory Cooper’s ligaments. Dermal lesions are almost always benign and include epidermal inclusion cysts and sebaceous cysts. 

• 
Epidermal inclusion cysts have a true epidermal cell lining and arise either from plugging 


of a hair follicle by keratinous debris, or from traumatic epidermal implantation. They are the most common type of epithelial cyst. On ultrasound imaging, an epidermal inclusion cyst most often appears as a circumscribed lesion with variable internal echotexture ranging from anechoic to heterogeneous, depending on the amount of internal keratinous debris. 
• Sebaceous cysts are associated with sebaceous ducts and share an epithelial lining with the 
sebaceous gland. They may be indistinguishable from epidermal inclusion cysts on clinical exam and ultrasound but are typically lucent on mammography due to the fatty sebum contents; the keratin debris contained in epidermal inclusion cysts, on the other hand, appears dense mammographically. 
• A lesion can be confidently diagnosed as a benign epidermal inclusion cyst or sebaceous cyst when it is located completely within the echogenic dermis. 
Subcutaneous zone and skin lesions (continued) 
• When a lesion is not completely within the dermis, two clues can be helpful to establish dermal origin: 
1) Visualization of a claw of dermal tissue wrapping around the lesion (indicates the point at which the inclusion cyst interrupts the deep dermal layer). 
2) Visualization of a tract connecting the lesion to the epidermal skin surface. 

Epidermal inclusion cysts in two different patients: 
Transverse ultrasound of the axilla (left image) demonstrates a heterogeneously hypoechoic, oval circumscribed mass partially situated in the dermis, as indicated by dermal tissue wrapping around the mass (claw sign, yellow arrow). 
Ultrasound of a separate patient (right image) shows a hypoechoic lesion just deep to the epidermis with a tract connecting to the skin surface (red arrow). 
• 
Rupture of an epidermal inclusion cyst or sebaceous cyst can incite a severe inflammatory reaction, leading to chemical dermatitis. Therefore, core needle biopsy is to be avoided if epidermal inclusion cyst is suspected. If tissue sampling is felt to be indicated, surgical excision is preferable. 

• 
In contrast, lesions arising from the hypodermis (subcutaneous fat) can include a broader range of pathologies, including papilloma, fibroadenoma, and breast cancer. It is therefore critical to identify the anatomic site of origin as best as possible. 


Mammary zone 
• The mammary zone is the site of most breast pathology and includes ducts and terminal ductal lobular units (TDLUs), fat, fibrous tissue, and Cooper’s ligaments. 
Retromammary zone 
• The retromammary zone is just superficial to pectoralis and contains fat and a few Cooper’s ligaments. 
Imaging fat in the breast 
• 
Parenchymal breast fat is hypoechoic, unlike ultrasound imaging of fat elsewhere in the body. 

• 
In contrast, fat in a lymph node hilum, fat in a lipoma, and fat necrosis may all appear hyperechoic. 




Ultrasound technique 
Scanning planes 
• 
Ultrasound scanning can be performed in radial/antiradial or transverse/longitudinal planes. 

• 
Radial/antiradial scanning has been advocated as superior because ductal anatomy is oriented radially. 


Antiradial 
Radial 

• Transverse/longitudinal orientation is less suited to the centripetal breast anatomy but is familiar from body ultrasound imaging. 
Transverse (axial) Longitudinal (sagittal) 

Annotation 
• 
Full annotation is mandatory, including the side, the clock face position, the distance from the nipple, and the transducer orientation (radial/antiradial or transverse/longitudinal). 

• 
Alternatively, some ultrasound systems allow graphical annotations. Documenting the distance from the nipple in addition to the graphic is recommended. 



BI-RADS lexicon for ultrasound masses 
• Use of the BI-RADS lexicon allows one to stratify sonographic masses on a spectrum from benign to malignant based solely on the report wording. 
Size and position 
• A mass should be measured in all three orthogonal planes, with position labeled in terms of clockface and distance from the nipple. 
Shape 
• The BI-RADS lexicon for the shape of an ultrasound mass includes round, oval, and irregular, 
the same as for a mammographic mass. 
Orientation 
• 
The orientation of the long axis of a mass (relative to the skin) is unique to ultrasound. 

• 
A mass that is parallel in orientation is more likely to be benign. 

• 
In contrast, a non-parallel mass (known informally as “taller-than-wide”) is oriented with the long axis vertical and is suspicious for malignancy. This finding is based on the propensity of a malignant process to violate tissue planes. 


Margin 
• 
Similar to mammography, benign masses are typically circumscribed. 

• 
If the margins of a mass are not circumscribed, they can be characterized as indistinct, angular, microlobulated, or spiculated. 


Indistinct: No clear boundary between the mass and its surrounding tissue. Angular: Featuring sharp corners. Microlobulated: Serrated appearance of the margins. Spiculated: Linear projections emanating from the mass. 
• Note that obscured is not a BI-RADs descriptor for ultrasound, only for mammography. 
Echo pattern 
• 
The echo pattern describes the internal texture of an ultrasound lesion. Most benign and malignant lesions are hypoechoic. The margins of a lesion are more reliable than the echogenicity in determining if a lesion has benign features. 

• 
An anechoic structure has no internal echoes and most commonly (but not always) represents a simple cyst. 

•A 
hypoechoic structure is defined as decreased echogenicity in comparison to the surrounding mammary fat. 

• 
An isoechoic structure has the same echogenicity as surrounding fat. An isoechoic lesion can be challenging to visualize. 

•A 
hyperechoic structure is more echogenic than fat. It may be either equal or greater in echogenicity compared to fibroglandular tissue. 

•A 
complex cystic and solid echo pattern describes a lesion that is partially cystic (containing anechoic elements) and partially solid (containing elements of varying echogenicity). 

•A 
heterogeneous echo pattern represents a combination of internal echogenicities. 


Posterior features 
• The posterior features of a lesion describe the attenuation characteristics of the sound beam deep to the lesion. 
Posterior features (continued) 
• 
Acoustic enhancement (also called posterior through-transmission) refers to a column of increased echogenicity posterior (deep) to the mass. Posterior enhancement is one of the characteristics of a simple cyst, although on its own posterior enhancement is not specific. 

• 
Shadowing is attenuation of the sound beam as it passes through the lesion. Shadowing is associated with fibrosis, such as from a neoplastic desmoplastic reaction or surgical scar. 

• 
If a lesion has no posterior acoustic features, then the echogenicity of the area immediately deep to the mass is the same as adjacent tissue. 

• 
A lesion can also have a combined pattern of posterior acoustic features, such as a fibroadenoma containing a large, coarse, shadowing calcification. 



Ultrasound differentiation of benign and malignant solid masses 
• Certain ultrasound features are associated with benign or malignant lesions. In some circumstances, a solid mass that demonstrates only benign ultrasound findings may be classified as BI-RADS 3 and followed. 
Ultrasound features of a benign mass 
• 
Lack of any malignant findings: If even a single malignant feature is present then a lesion is indeterminate or suspicious and should be biopsied. 

• 
Marked hyperechogenicity (relative to fat). 

• 
Circumscribed margins. 

• 
Parallel orientation to the skin (wider-than-tall; width:height >1.4). 

• 
Oval shape. 

• 
Few gentle lobulations. 

• 
Thin echogenic pseudocapsule. 


Ultrasound features of a malignant mass 
• 
Spiculated margins, which is the most specific sign of malignancy. 

• 
Non-parallel (taller-than-wide) orientation, the second most specific sign. 

• 
Angular or microlobulated margins. 

• 
Posterior shadowing. 

• 
Markedly hypoechoic echotexture. 


Indeterminate ultrasound features 
• The following features are not helpful in differentiating between benign or malignant masses: Lesion size, iso- or mild hypoechogenicity, posterior acoustic enhancement, and heterogeneous or homogeneous texture. 

Ultrasound use of BI-RADS 3 
• 
It may be appropriate to place specific well-defined entities into the BI-RADS 3 (probably benign) category, with literature supporting less than 2% risk of cancer. 

• 
Isolated complicated cyst containing low-level internal echoes, without solid component 

• 
Clustered microcysts (discussed later in the chapter). 

• 
Oval, hypoechoic, circumscribed, parallel mass, most likely a fibroadenoma. 

• 
Hyperechoic mass with central hypoechogenicity, most likely fat necrosis. Note that if an oil cyst is seen at mammography this finding can be classified as benign. 

• 
Additional BI-RADS 3 cases for which robust data does not exist include isolated shadowing without a mass, and architectural distortion thought to be due to a surgical scar.
