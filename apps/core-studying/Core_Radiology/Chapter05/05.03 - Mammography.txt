Mammography 
Screening mammography 
• 
The goal of screening mammography is to detect pre-clinical breast cancer in asymptomatic 

women. Screening mammography detects 2 to 8 cancers per 1,000 women screened. Mammography has decreased sensitivity in women with dense breasts. 

• 
Since 1990, the mortality from breast cancer has been steadily declining at a rate of approximately 2.2% per year, thought to be due to improvements in adjuvant therapy and screening mammography. 

• 
The current standard recommendation in the United States is annual screening mammography beginning at age 40 for women at average risk for breast cancer, based on guidelines issued by multiple national organizations including the American College of Radiology (ACR) and Society of Breast Imaging (SBI). 

• 
In contrast, while the American Cancer Society (ASC) and the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) agree that screening from age 40 reduces breast cancer mortality, both organizations recommend beginning to screen at a later age due to uncertain benefits versus risks in younger women. 

• 
The ACS (2015) recommends annual screening mammography between ages 45–54 and biennial screening for age 55 or older. Women have the option to start annual screening at ages 40–44. 

• 
The USPSTF (2009) recommends biennial mammography between ages 50–74. Decision to start screening at ages 40–49 should be made on an individual basis. 

• 
The potential concerns for mammographic screening include a very small risk of inducing breast cancer from radiation exposure, and risks of over diagnosis including anxiety from false positives and unnecessary biopsies. 

• 
Randomized control trials have shown that screening mammography can significantly reduce breast cancer mortality for women aged 40–74 by at least 20%. 

• 
Computer modeling of breast cancer screening also showed that the greatest reduction in breast cancer specific mortality is achieved with screening mammography starting at age 40. 

• 
There are varying recommendations on the age to stop screening, as listed below.

• 
The two standard mammographic views are cranio-caudal (CC) and medial-lateral-oblique (MLO). 

• 
The cranio-caudal (CC) image plane is transaxial. 

• 
The medial-lateral-oblique (MLO) image plane is approximately 45–60 degrees from the 


axial plane, paralleling the course of the pectoralis muscle heading into the axilla. The MLO view is ideal for screening, as it captures most of the breast tissue in a single view. Note that the superior-medial breast tissue may be excluded on the MLO view. 
• At the technologist’s discretion, additional views may be performed to assure complete 
imaging of all fibroglandular tissue: Cleavage view (CV) images the medial breast tissue of both breasts. The exaggerated CC (XCC) view pulls either lateral or medial tissue into the imaging detector. 
Online and offline screening 
• 
Typically, most screening mammography is interpreted offline, where a batch of exams is reviewed in bulk some time after the films were taken. 

• 
Online screening, where women have mammography performed and then wait to get a final report from the radiologist, leads to more imaging being performed and more false-positives, with the same cancer detection rate. 

• 
In contrast to screening mammography, all diagnostic mammography is performed “online” as a monitored exam with the patient staying for all possible imaging and the final results/ recommendations before leaving. 




Diagnostic mammography 
Indications for diagnostic mammography 
• 
Diagnostic mammography is usually performed for a breast problem (pain, lump, skin thickening, nipple discharge). 

• 
Other indications for diagnostic mammography include annual mammography in an asymptomatic woman with a past history of breast cancer, short interval follow-up (following of BI-RADS 3 lesions), and evaluation of an abnormality found on screening mammogram. 


Diagnostic mammography procedure 
• 
Any mammographic abnormality is first localized in three-dimensional space, then worked-up with special problem-solving techniques, which are discussed later in this section. 

• 
Often, ultrasound is added at the radiologist’s discretion. 

• 
Each patient waits until all imaging is completed before receiving a summary of the final interpretation and recommendations from the radiologist. 



Approach to interpreting a mammogram 
Evaluate image quality and adequacy 
• 
The first step in evaluating a mammogram is to determine if the study is technically adequate. 

• 
There should be adequate tissue imaged on both the CC and MLO views. The posterior nipple line is a line drawn from the nipple to the pectoralis muscle – or edge of the film on the CC view if the pectoralis is not visualized. The posterior nipple lines drawn on the CC and MLO views should be within 1 cm of each other. 


CC MLO 

On the MLO view, the pectoral muscle should be convex anteriorly and visible at 
least to the level of the nipple. 
• 
The image must be free from blur and artifacts. The trabeculae should be sharp; if blur is present, then benign calcifications can be mistaken for suspicious amorphous calcifications, and subtle calcifications can be missed entirely. 

• 
The nipple of each breast should be in profile in at least one view. 


Compare each side 
• Each projection should be globally compared side-to-side to evaluate for symmetry. 
Evaluate and magnify each image 
• 
Each image should be carefully evaluated for signs of malignancy. The mammographic signs of malignancy are mass, calcification, architectural distortion, and asymmetry. Calcifications are best viewed at 1:1 or higher magnification, while architectural distortion is best seen when the whole breast is visualized. 

• 
When viewing a digital mammogram, every portion of the image should be carefully evaluated at 1:1 zoom. 


Compare to prior studies 
• 
Even if a study appears unremarkable at first glance, comparison to prior exams can often reveal a subtle progressive change. For instance, an apparent normal island of parenchymal tissue may be slowly growing and represent malignancy. 

• 
In general, it is best to carefully compare the previous exam from at least two years prior, to appreciate slowly growing changes. 



Fibroglandular density 

Almost entirely fatty Scattered areas of Heterogeneously dense, which Extremely dense, which lowers fibroglandular density may obscure small masses the sensitivity of mammography 
• 
In every mammographic report, the mammographic pattern of fibroglandular density should be characterized into one of the above descriptors. 

• 
Women with dense fibroglandular tissue have an increased risk of developing breast cancer, and detection of early cancer can be obscured by the fibroglandular tissue. A woman with extremely dense breasts has a 5x relative risk of breast cancer compared to a woman with almost entirely fatty breasts. 

• 
Bilateral interval increase in fibroglandular density is usually benign and may be caused either by hormonal effects or breast edema. A unilateral increase in fibroglandular density is worrisome for lymphatic obstruction, which may be malignant. 

• 
Edema due to systemic causes, such as congestive heart failure, typically causes bilateral trabecular blurring and skin thickening. 

• 
Hormone therapy may cause an increase in fibroglandular density, without skin thickening. Proliferation of cysts and fibrocystic change can be seen, even in postmenopausal women. 

• 
Pregnancy, lactation, and weight loss may all cause an interval increase in fibroglandular density. 



Skin thickening 
• Unilateral skin thickening can be due to either benign or malignant causes. Similar to 
changes in fibroglandular density, bilateral skin thickening is usually benign and the result of a systemic process. 
Skin thickening: Benign causes 
• 
Radiation therapy (usually unilateral). 

• 
Acute mastitis (usually unilateral). 

• 
Skin inflammation (usually unilateral and focal). 

• 
CHF (fluid overload), renal failure (fluid overload due to protein wasting), and liver failure (fluid overload due to hypoalbuminemia) may all produce unilateral or bilateral skin 


thickening. 
Skin thickening: Malignant causes 
• 
Inflammatory carcinoma, which represents invasion of dermal lymphatics by cancer. A mammographic mass may be present. 

• 
Locally advanced carcinoma. 

• 
Lymphatic obstruction from axillary adenopathy. 



BI-RADS lexicon for mammographic masses 
Is the mass seen in more than one view? 
• A mammographic mass is a space-occupying lesion with convex borders seen in two different projections. In contrast, an asymmetry is seen in one view only. 
Evaluate past fi lms: Is it new? 
• 
There are many different descriptors to characterize a mammographic mass using the BI­RADS lexicon, but regardless of morphology, the presence of a new mass is suspicious and must be evaluated fully. 

• 
Conversely, a malignant-looking mass should still be regarded with suspicion even if it hasn’t changed. Slow growing carcinomas, such as tubular carcinoma, can stay stable for years. 

• 
A stable mass with all benign features is almost always regarded as benign. 


Evaluate the margins, using the BI-RADS lexicon 

• Careful evaluation of the margins of a mammographic mass at the interface with surrounding tissue is key to stratifying the suspicion for malignancy. The five BI-RADS terms used to describe the margins are circumscribed, microlobulated, obscured, indistinct, and 
spiculated. 
• Circumscribed: At least 75% of the margin must be well-defined, while the remainder may be obscured with overlying tissue. In general, unless a mass is new, a circumscribed mass is benign, and a non-circumscribed mass is 
suspicious. Of course, there are exceptions to this: abscesses can present with non-circumscribed margins and certain types of cancers can present with predominantly circumscribed margins. 
• 
Microlobulated: A microlobulated mass has a finely irregular or serrated edge. 

• 
Obscured: A margin is obscured if it is greater than 25% hidden by superimposed or adjacent normal tissue. The term “obscured” implies that the radiologist believes that the mass may be circumscribed, but the margin is hidden by overlying tissue. 

• 
Indistinct: A poorly defined margin (or portion of the margin) raises concern that the lesion may be infiltrating. 

• 
Spiculated: Linear densities radiate from a mass. A spiculated mass is malignant until proven 


otherwise. 
Describe the density 
Fat-containing Low density Equal density High density 

• 
Most breast cancers that form a visible mass are of equal or higher density than the surrounding fibroglandular tissue. 

• 
The BI-RADS lexicon for density includes fat-containing, low density, equal density, and high density. A circumscribed fat-containing mass is benign. 


Describe the shape 
Round Oval Irregular 

• The BI-RADS lexicon for shape includes round, oval, and irregular. Although malignancy may be any form, an irregular mass is most suspicious for malignancy. An oval-shaped mass may include up to two to three smooth lobulations. 
Describe the location by naming the quadrant and (optionally) the depth 
• 
The four quadrants of each breast are: Upper outer quadrant, upper inner quadrant, lower outer quadrant, and lower inner quadrant. 

• 
When referring to the opposite breast, the mirror opposite quadrant is the contralateral quadrant with the same name. For instance, the upper outer quadrant of the left breast is 


the mirror opposite quadrant of the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. 
• 
If subareolar or axillary tail are used to localize a lesion, then it is not necessary to specify a quadrant. 

• 
Although clockface is used for ultrasound location, quadrant is preferred for mammography. 

• 
Depth is commonly described as anterior (or shallow), middle, or posterior depth, separating the breast into thirds. 


Measure the size 
• Size is a poor predictor of malignancy, but changes in size determine if a lesion is growing. 
Look for associated features 
• 
Architectural distortion represents radiating linear densities emanating from a central point, without a definite mass visible. Architectural distortion is caused by tethering of the normal fibroglandular tissue and is highly concerning for a cancer, although there are some benign causes. If there is no history of surgery or trauma, biopsy is appropriate. 

• 
Microcalcifications may be associated with malignant ductal calcification. 

• 
Skin retraction is most commonly postsurgical but may be due to a desmoplastic tumor. 

• 
Nipple retraction is tethering or angulation of the nipple. Retraction should not be confused with inversion (where the whole nipple points inwards). Nipple inversion may be developmental, bilateral, and is not necessarily a sign of malignancy if stable. 

• 
Skin thickening may represent edema or may be secondary to prior radiation therapy. 

• 
Trabecular thickening represents thickening of the fibrous septa of the breast, which can be seen in edema or in patients who have received radiation therapy. 

• 
Axillary adenopathy may be hyperplastic or malignant. Although it is normal for a few nodes to be present in the axilla, nodes with replacement of the normal fatty hilum may warrant evaluation, especially if new. 


Example of BI-RADS terminology 

CC view mammogram (left image) shows an oval mass (yellow arrow) with partially obscured margins in the inner anterior breast. The mass is better evaluated on spot compression view (right image) and demonstrates microlobulated margins (red arrows). Biopsy of this mass revealed papilloma with carcinoma in situ.

Overview of mammographic calcifications 
Significance of mammographic calcifications 
• 
Most mammograms will show calcifications, which are overwhelmingly likely to be benign. However, careful analysis of breast calcifications is essential. Abnormal calcification may be the earliest, and possibly the only, mammographic manifestation of cancer. 

• 
When characterizing calcifications, morphology and distribution are essential. 

• 
Certain types of calcifications can be definitively characterized as benign, while some are highly suspicious for malignancy. Other morphologies are indeterminate. 


Mammographic technique 
• 
It is almost always necessary to perform spot compression magnification to characterize calcifications as either indeterminate or suspicious for malignancy. In contrast, most types of benign calcification can be described on routine full-field views (an exception would be milk of calcium calcifications, which generally require a true lateral view with magnification). 

• 
Magnification employs air-gap technique and a small (0.1 mm) focal spot. 




Typically benign calcifications (BI-RADS 2) 
Skin calcifications 
• 
Skin calcifications are associated with sweat glands, are usually punctate or lucent-centered, and are most common medially where the concentration of sweat glands is higher. 

• 
A cluster of skin calcifications projecting over the breast may be confused for grouped calcifications in the breast itself. If skin calcifications are suspected, a tangential view should be performed by placing a BB directly over the calcifications in one view and then re-imaging with the BB in tangent. Calcifications which are in the skin should be seen in the dermis on the tangential view. Tomographic imaging can also help confirm whether or not calcifications 


lie within the skin. 

Vascular calcifications 

Vascular and secretory calcifications: 
Arterial vascular calcifications are present in the upper portion of the image (yellow arrow), while large rod-like calcifications are present in the inferior portion of the image (red arrows). 
Case courtesy Sughra Raza, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Arterial vascular calcifications within the breast have a distinctive morphology and are typically not mentioned in the body of the report unless they are very extensive or the patient is very young. 

• 
Early or incomplete vascular calcifications may pose a potential problem as they may appear similar to fine linear calcifications, which are suspicious. 



Large rod-like calcifications 
• 
Large rod-like calcifications are caused by secretory disease (also called plasma cell mastitis), which is a benign, inflammatory process seen in postmenopausal women. 

• 
These calcifications follow a ductal pattern similar to DCIS, however they have a classic appearance which should not be confused with fine linear or fine-linear branching calcifications. 



Coarse or “popcorn-like” calcifications 

Mammogram shows a circumscribed, oval mass with associated “popcorn-like” calcifications, diagnostic of a hyalinizing fibroadenoma. 
• 
“Popcorn-like” calcifications are caused by an involuting or hyalinizing fibroadenoma. 

• 
Not all fibroadenomas calcify. However, when calcification does occur, it starts as peripheral calcification and progresses to the classic chunky popcorn-like appearance. 

• 
At an early stage, the small calcifications of a fibroadenoma may resemble those of cancer and prompt biopsy; however, a benign fibroadenoma can be diagnosed with confidence when the calcifications have the typical “popcorn-like” morphology. 


Milk of calcium calcifications 

CC spot-magnification view (left image) shows amorphous calcifications (arrows). A true lateral spot-magnification view (right image) shows layering of the calcific sediment (arrows), diagnostic of milk of 
calcium. 
• 
Milk of calcium represents free-floating calcium in tiny benign cysts. 

• 
The most important feature of these calcifications is the apparent change in shape of the calcium particles between the CC and lateral projections. 

• 
On the CC view the calcifications are often indistinct and appear as fuzzy, round, amorphous deposits. On the 90-degree lateral, they are more clearly defined, semilunar or crescent-shaped in morphology due to dependent layering. 



Suture calcifications 

Curvilinear calcifications of variable lengths (arrows) represent calcified surgical suture material. 
• Suture calcifications represent calcium deposited on suture material, usually after radiation therapy. Suture calcifications are uncommonly seen due to changes in modern surgical 
technique. 
Dystrophic calcifications 

CC and MLO views show a lucent lesion with a bizarre whorled appearance and geometric calcifications (arrows), typical of fat necrosis. 
• 
Dystrophic calcifications may occur as a sequela of surgery, biopsy, trauma, or irradiation. 

• 
Usually the appearance of dystrophic calcification is distinctive, with coarse, irregular shapes often in association with areas of lucency (due to fat necrosis), but these may pose a diagnostic challenge when new or evolving. 


Round and punctate calcifications 
• Round and punctate calcifications are associated with various etiologies including fibrocystic change. The round shape is sometimes due to deposition in the small terminal acini of breast lobules. When diffusely or randomly distributed, round and punctate calcifications 
are considered benign. 
• 
When a round calcification is smaller than 0.5 mm, the term “punctate” is preferred. 

• 
An isolated group of punctate calcifications on a baseline mammogram should be classified as BI-RADS 3 (discussed later in chapter). 



Rim calcifications 
• 
Fine peripheral calcification represents calcium deposited on the surface of a sphere, usually occurring in an area of fat necrosis or a cyst with calcified walls. 

• 
Previous versions of BI-RADS described these calcifications as “lucent centered” or “eggshell.” 




Suspicious morphology calcifications (BI-RADS 4) 
Amorphous calcifications 

Numerous amorphous calcifications are present in a dense breast in a segmental distribution (arrows). This pattern is suspicious for malignancy and biopsy is warranted. 
• 
Amorphous calcifications are too small or hazy to ascertain their detailed morphologic appearance. 

• 
Amorphous calcifications in a diffuse distribution are usually benign, although magnification views may be necessary to evaluate for any suspicious groups. 

• 
Amorphous calcifications in a grouped, regional, linear, or segmental distribution are more suspicious and warrant biopsy. The positive predictive value of amorphous calcifications has been reported at 20%. 


Coarse heterogeneous calcifications 

Coned-down image from a spot magnification mammogram shows 
a cluster of coarse heterogeneous 
calcifications. These are suspicious and biopsy is warranted. 
• 
Coarse heterogeneous calcifications are irregular calcifications that are generally larger than 

0.5 mm, but smaller than dystrophic calcifications. 

• 
Evolving dystrophic calcifications or early calcifications associated with hyalinizing fibroadenomas or fat necrosis may appear as coarse heterogeneous calcifications and pose a diagnostic challenge. 

• 
Coarse heterogeneous calcifications may be associated with malignancy and biopsy is warranted. 


Fine pleomorphic calcifications 

CC and MLO mammograms (top images) demonstrate a large group of fine pleomorphic calcifications (arrows). Ultrasound (bottom left image) shows an ill-defined hypoechoic mass, with the calcifications evident as punctate echogenic foci (arrows). Color CAD angiomap from the patient’s breast MRI shows the segmental, non-mass enhancement in a regional distribution in the left breast, with the red color map corresponding to malignant-type washout kinetics. This lesion is highly suspicious for malignancy (BI-RADS 5). 
• 
By definition, fine pleomorphic calcifications vary in shape and size, producing a characteristic dot-dash appearance. 

• 
Fine pleomorphic calcifications are highly suspicious for malignancy, most commonly seen in DCIS or invasive ductal carcinoma. 

• 
When evaluating any group of calcifications, one should always ask, “can these be pleomorphic?” If so, biopsy should be obtained. 


Fine linear or fine-linear branching calcifications 
• 
Fine linear and fine-linear branching calcifications are highly suspicious for malignancy. Branching pattern suggests filling of the lumen of a duct system involved by DCIS. 

• 
If fine linear or fine-linear branching calcifications are seen in a segmental distribution, BI­RADS 5 is appropriate (highly suggestive of malignancy). 




Distribution of calcium 
Di˜use Regional Linear Grouped Segmental 
usually benign malignancy less likely more suspicious distribution 
• 
The distributi on of calcifi cati on can greatly aff ect the suspicion of malignancy. 

• 
Although diff use and regional calcifi cati ons are usually benign, the morphology of the calcifi cati ons in questi on is also important. A regional distributi on of suspicious fi ne pleomorphic or fi ne-linear branching calcifi cati ons may represent cancer. 

• 
Similarly, a more suspicious distributi on (linear, grouped/clustered, or segmental) of calcifi cati ons with a typically benign morphology may warrant further workup. 


Diffuse 
• 
Diff use calcifi cati ons are distributed randomly throughout the breast. 

• 
Punctate and amorphous calcifi cati ons in a diff use or scatt ered distributi on are usually benign and oft en bilateral, typically associated with fi brocysti c change or sclerosing 


adenosis. 
Regional 
• Regional calcifi cati ons are distributed in a large area (>2 cm in largest dimension) of breast ti ssue not conforming to a ductal distributi on. Since this distributi on may involve most of a quadrant or more than a single quadrant, malignancy is less likely. 
Linear 
• 
Linear calcifi cati ons are arrayed in a line. 

• 
Linear distributi on of calcifi cati ons elevates suspicion for malignancy as this suggests calcium deposits within a duct. 

• 
Note that typically benign large rod-like calcifi cati ons are oft en linear in distributi on. 


Grouped 
• 
Grouped calcifi cati ons are defi ned as at least fi ve small calcifi cati ons located within 1 cm of each other, with the extent of the calcifi cati ons measuring <2 cm in size. Calcifi cati ons >2 cm in extent are considered regional in distributi on, as described above. 

• 
Grouped calcifi cati ons raise suspicion for malignancy. 


Segmental 
• 
Segmental calcifi cati ons suggest calcium deposited in a ductal system, which is worrisome. 

• 
When the morphology is clearly secretory (rod-like), a segmental distributi on can be benign. 

• 
When intermediate-suspicion (such as amorphous) or typically benign (such as round or punctate) calcifi cati ons are seen in a segmental distributi on, concern should be raised for malignancy.

asymmetries and architectural distortion 
Asymmetry 

MLO (left image) and CC views show an asymmetry on the MLO only (arrow), which represents superposition of fibroglandular tissue at middle to posterior depth on the CC view. 
• An asymmetry is a region of breast tissue that is prominent on one view only and most commonly represents superposition of glandular tissue. 
Global asymmetry 

Global asymmetry: Bilateral MLO mammograms show scattered fibroglandular densities in the right breast (left image) and an extremely dense left breast, with the asymmetrically increased density on the left occupying more than one quadrant. There is no associated mass, calcification, architectural distortion, or skin thickening. 
• Global asymmetry is an asymmetric amount or density of breast tissue involving the majority of one breast only, most commonly due to greater volume of parenchyma in one breast compared to the other. More than one quadrant must be involved. 
• Although global asymmetry is usually a normal variant, further workup is warranted when associated with a concerning finding such as a mass, architectural distortion, skin thickening, or any palpable abnormality. 

Focal asymmetry 

MLO and CC mammograms of the right breast (top images) show a focal asymmetry (circles) in 
the upper inner breast at posterior depth. This is 
stable at 5 years follow-up (left image, MLO view). 
•A 
focal asymmetry is an abnormality involving less than one quadrant seen on two views (in contrast to an asymmetry) but that does not meet the criteria for a mass. A mass will have distinct borders and convex contours, while a focal asymmetry will have concave contours. 

• 
A focal asymmetry usually represents a prominent area of normal breast tissue, particularly when there is interspersed fat, but further evaluation may be warranted. 

• 
After a complete workup (including additional mammographic views with spot compression and targeted ultrasound), a nonpalpable focal asymmetry has <1% chance of being malignant and can be placed in BI-RADS 3 if seen on a baseline exam. The lesion can be called benign after two to three years of stability. 


Developing asymmetry 


CC (top left) and MLO (top right) mammograms demonstrate a subtle new focal asymmetry (circles) in the lower inner breast that is best appreciated when compared to the prior year’s study (below). Ultrasound (not shown) demonstrated an irregular shadowing mass. 

• 
A developing asymmetry is a focal asymmetry that is either new or increased in size. 

• 
A developing asymmetry is a suspicious finding, shown to represent breast cancer in 12.8% of cases at screening mammography and in 26.7% of cases at diagnostic mammography. 

• 
The initial step in the workup of a developing asymmetry is to determine if it is a true lesion or summation artifact. A typical mammographic workup includes spot compression views and/or repeating the standard views to confirm that the questioned asymmetry persists. 

• 
After diagnostic evaluation confirms that the developing asymmetry is a true lesion that can be localized in three-dimensional space, then ultrasound is performed. A mass demonstrated sonographically can be targeted for biopsy, and if a benign correlate is seen (e.g., a simple cyst) then the developing asymmetry can be assessed as BI-RADS 2 (benign). 

• 
If no sonographic correlate is seen for a true developing asymmetry then stereotactic biopsy is required, as the risk of cancer is greater than 2% despite the absence of a sonographic abnormality. 

• 
MRI generally does not play a role in the standard evaluation of a developing asymmetry. Since a developing asymmetry is a suspicious mammographic finding, then the absence of an MRI correlate would not obviate the need for biopsy. 


Architectural distortion 

Patient A: Architectural distortion is caused by a scar Patient B: Single slice from a mammographic from prior excisional biopsy (circle). tomogram shows architectural distortion (circle), which was invasive ductal carcinoma on biopsy. 
• 
Architectural distortion describes lines radiating from a central point with no central mass visible, producing tethering and indentation of the breast tissue. 

• 
Architectural distortion is suspicious for malignancy. The differential for architectural distortion includes invasive malignancy, complex sclerosing lesion/radial scar, post-biopsy scar, and some forms of fibrocystic change such as sclerosing adenosis. 


Mammographic workup and problem solving 
Spot compression (with or without magnification) 
• 
Spot compression is compression of a focal region of the breast, which allows for better compression and therefore better resolution. Spot compression is almost always the next step in evaluating a focal suspicious mammographic abnormality. 

• 
Typically, for evaluation of calcifications, spot compression magnification is used. For evaluation of a mass or asymmetry, magnification is usually not needed. Note that areas of architectural distortion may actually appear less apparent on magnification views. 

• 
If an apparent asymmetry “presses out” with focal compression, then the apparent abnormality more likely represents superimposition of normal pliable fibroglandular tissue. Often ultrasound will also be performed to further assure absence of any corresponding suspicious finding. 

• 
If the abnormality does not significantly change shape when compressed, then it is suspicious and its margins could be further assessed on spot magnification views. Evaluation 


with ultrasound would also be warranted. 
• 
A smaller compression device will allow more precise compression, with the downside of potentially losing landmarks in the surrounding parenchyma. 

• 
Compared to full-field digital mammography, tomosynthesis has the advantage of improved lesion detection and characterization by reducing the effect of overlapping breast tissue. Tomosynthesis may decrease the need for additional diagnostic imaging such as spot 


compression. 
XCC (exaggerated cranio-caudal) 
• 
The lateral XCC (XCCL) pulls lateral breast tissue into the detector. 

• 
The medial XCC (XCCM) pulls medial breast tissue into the detector. 


Rolled views (CC variant) 
• 
Rolled views are obtained by moving the top and bottom of the breast in opposite directions. Rolled CC views are helpful to localize a lesion that is seen on the CC view only. 

• 
Two rolled views are typically obtained. One view is obtained with the top of the breast 


rolled medially (RCCM) and a second view with the top rolled laterally (RCCL). If a lesion moves medially with an RCCM view, then it’s in the superior breast. If a lesion moves laterally with an RCCM view, then it’s in the inferior breast. 
• The lateral view can also be rolled, although this is less commonly performed. 
Reduced compression 
• Images with reduced compression can be obtained to image far posterior lesions that may “slip out” of the detector when full compression is applied. 
True lateral view (ML or LM) 
• 
A true lateral can be obtained in an ML (most commonly) or LM projection. In an ML view, the X-rays first travel through the medial breast, with the detector placed laterally. Conversely, the detector is medial in an LM projection. It is ideal to place the lesion in question closer to the detector if possible. For instance, a medial lesion is best imaged in an LM projection. 

• 
The true lateral is used to diagnose milk of calcium. In addition to spot compression magnification, magnification spot views should also be obtained in the true lateral projection when milk of calcium is suspected. 


In the true lateral view, the precipitated calcium sinks to the bottom of the small cysts, where it is seen mammographically as tiny crescents (versus the fuzzy round appearance of the CC view). 
• 
The true lateral view is helpful to triangulate a lesion seen in the MLO view but not CC. 

• 
The true lateral can be helpful for planning a stereotactic procedure.

Triangulation (continued) 
• 
A true lateral view is helpful to triangulate a lesion seen only on the MLO view. 

• 
If the lesion rises on the lateral compared to the MLO, the lesion is located in the medial breast (medial: muffins rise). If the lesion sinks, it is lateral (lateral: lead sinks). 


Working up a mass or focal asymmetry seen on screening mammography 
• A screening mammogram can only receive the BI-RADS 1, 2, or 0 assessments. If screening 
mammogram findings are concerning, the patient is assessed as BI-RADS 0 and is recalled for additional evaluation. 
• 
When the patient returns for the diagnostic workup, spot compression views of the area in question should be obtained. Altered projections or rolled views can also be used if necessary. If additional diagnostic mammographic views show only normal pliable fibroglandular tissue, then no further workup is needed (BI-RADS 1). 

• 
If an abnormality persists on spot compression, then it needs to be localized on two orthogonal views. When correlating a lesion on two views, it is important to remember that the lesion should be located at approximately the same distance (within 1 cm) from the nipple on each view. This rule may prevent mistaken localization of different lesions on each projection. 

• 
If the lesion is seen only on the MLO, a lateral view should be obtained to triangulate the lesion. A lesion seen on the MLO view but not the CC view may be located far laterally. An exaggerated CC lateral (XCCL) view can better image the far lateral tissue. 

• 
A lesion seen only on the CC view may be in the upper-inner quadrant and not included in the MLO view. Rolled CC views are typically performed to localize lesions seen only in the CC 


view. 
• 
Once a lesion is localized to a quadrant, targeted ultrasound should be performed. 

• 
If a suspicious single-view finding still cannot be localized despite a thorough mammographic and ultrasound evaluation, MRI can be helpful as a problem-solving tool. Mammographic stereotactic biopsy is also an option to biopsy a one-view finding (although stereotactic biopsy is used most commonly to biopsy calcifications). 

• 
In general, biopsy should be performed for a mass with any suspicious feature either on ultrasound or mammography. For instance, a circumscribed mammographic mass that has an indistinct or microlobulated margin on ultrasound is suspicious despite its 


mammographic appearance. 
• 
Most new findings are suspicious, with a notable exception being a circumscribed mammographic mass shown definitively to be a simple cyst on ultrasound. 

• 
Two years of stability is generally considered adequate to call a benign-appearing mass benign, although some institutions advocate three years of surveillance. 


Palpable mass 
• The mammographic workup for a palpable abnormality is similar to that of an asymptomatic lesion found on mammography, with one key difference: In general, all palpable findings are evaluated by ultrasound, even if the mammogram is negative. 
Mammographic use of BI-RADS 3 
• There is data to support the assignment of BI-RADS 3 in the following three situations, which are not definitively benign but have been shown to have less than 2% risk of cancer. 
Circumscribed, benign-appearing solid mass 
• 
A probably benign solid mass must meet certain mammographic criteria. Its shape must be round or oval, and its margins must be circumscribed. The mass cannot have any associated suspicious microcalcifications. 

• 
Typically, any visible mammographic mass should also be evaluated with ultrasound. For a mass to be considered probably benign by ultrasound it must be oval (may have two or three smooth lobulations) with a visible echogenic capsule AND lack any malignant features, or must be uniformly hyperechoic AND lack any malignant features (see later section on ultrasound differentiation of benign and malignant solid masses). If both mammographic and sonographic criteria are met, a mass may be assigned BI-RADS 3. 

• 
A probably benign solid mass that has demonstrated at least two years of stability can usually be considered benign (BI-RADS 2). 

• 
Any interval growth or suspicious change in morphology should be recommended for biopsy. 


Grouped punctate round calcifications 
• 
Punctate calcifications are a subset of round calcifications that are <0.5 mm in size. It is usually necessary to use spot-compression magnification views to accurately characterize calcifications. 

• 
Grouped punctate calcifications (=5 calcifications/cm) on a baseline exam can be diagnosed as probably benign (BI-RADS 3). Note that the morphology must be clearly punctate or round, and the distribution must be in a group. For instance, a group of amorphous calcifications is indeterminate and usually warrants biopsy. Similarly, although rare, punctate or round calcifications in a linear or segmental distribution would be suspicious. 


Focal asymmetry 
• Assuming no ultrasound correlate is seen, a focal asymmetry seen on a baseline exam can be assessed as probably benign (BI-RADS 3) after a thorough imaging workup.
