Introduction to BI-RADS 
Overview 
• 
The breast imaging and reporting data system (BI-RADS) is a system for standardizing mammography, ultrasound, and MRI reports that incorporates a strict lexicon, structured reporting, and clearly defined assessment categories. This text adheres to the terminology of the fifth edition of the BI-RADS atlas, which was released in 2013. 

• 
All mammographic, ultrasound, and breast MRI findings and reports should closely adhere to the BI-RADS lexicon and assessment categories. 


Structure of the mammographic report 
• 
1) History and indication for examination with patient risk factors stated. 

• 
2) List of comparison studies. 

• 
3) Description of the overall breast composition, using the following categories: The breasts are almost entirely fatty. There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density. The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses. The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography. 

• 
4) A clear description of any significant findings, including location. 

• 
5) Overall impression, with BI-RADS assessment category and course of action when appropriate. 


Almost always, the course of action will be concordant with the BI-RADs assessment category. However, the fifth edition of BI-RADS allows the course of action to be separated from the assessment category in certain clinical situations. For example, the aspiration of a simple cyst designated as BI-RADS 2 to relieve patient pain. Additionally, a clinically suspected breast abscess or hematoma may be given a designation of BI-RADS 4, with the biopsy deferred for one month pending a repeat diagnostic evaluation. 

BI-RADS assessment categories 
Category 0: Need additional imaging 
• 
Additional imaging evaluation (such as spot compression, magnification, special mammographic views, or ultrasound) and/or prior mammograms are necessary before a final assessment can be assigned. 

• 
Category 0 is only appropriate for screening. All diagnostic mammography must conclude with a final assessment from 1–6. 



Category 1: Negative 
• Breasts are normal. 

Category 2: Benign 
• 
A finding that is described but is definitely benign is BI-RADS 2. 

• 
No additional workup or follow-up is needed. 

• 
Examples: Vascular or other typically benign calcifications, simple breast cysts, intramammary lymph nodes.

Category 3: Probably benign 
• 
A finding placed in BI-RADS 3 should have <2% risk of malignancy. 

• 
It is necessary to conduct a complete diagnostic imaging evaluation using diagnostic views (e.g., spot compression magnification, etc.) and/or ultrasound before assigning a probably benign (BI-RADS 3) assessment. BI-RADS 3 is never appropriate for screening mammography. 

• 
Three specific mammographic findings that may be appropriate for a BI-RADS 3 designation after complete diagnostic assessment include a circumscribed solid mass, focal asymmetry, and a single group of punctate calcifications. 

• 
BI-RADS 3 should generally be reserved for baseline exams. If a comparison is available and a finding is new or increased but otherwise meets criteria for a probably benign assessment, then biopsy is usually appropriate. BI-RADS 3 is generally not supported for palpable lesions, although there are single institution studies suggesting that it is acceptable to assign appropriate palpable lesions as BI-RADS 3 after a full imaging workup. 

• 
Action required: Short interval follow-up, typically 6 months. After 12 months of stability it is acceptable to lengthen the follow-up interval to one year. In general, if a benign-appearing lesion demonstrates two to three years of stability it can be considered benign (BI-RADS 2). Any interval change is suspicious and may warrant biopsy. 


Category 4: Suspicious 
• 
Findings are suspicious of malignancy, with a probability of being malignant >2% and <95%. 

• 
Category 4 can be subdivided into Category 4A, 4B, and 4C, with 4A being least suspicious, and 4C being most suspicious. 

• 
Action required: Biopsy. 


Category 5: Highly suggestive of malignancy 
• 
These lesions have a high probability (>95%) of being cancer. A lesion that a radiologist describes as “I’ll eat my hat if that’s not cancer!” should be classified as BI-RADS 5. The prototypical BI-RADS 5 cancer would be an irregular mass with spiculated margins and associated fine pleomorphic/fine linear-branching calcifications. 

• 
Action required: Biopsy. Any pathologic result other than cancer would be discordant. 


Category 6: Known biopsy-proven malignancy 
• This category is reserved for lesions identified on the imaging study with prior biopsy proof of malignancy. Typically, a plan of action is already in place.
