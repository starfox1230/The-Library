Sternalis muscle 

Mammogram shows an asymmetry in the far posterior medial left breast (arrow), seen on CC view only, that persists on spot compression view (left image). No corresponding abnormality was seen on ultrasound (not shown). Follow up MRI (right image) shows an accessory muscle lying anterior to the left pectoralis (arrow). 
A similar muscle is seen on the contralateral side. These represent bilateral sternalis muscles. 
• 
The sternalis muscle is a vertically oriented accessory parasternal chest wall muscle present in less than 10% of patients. It is either triangular or rounded in shape and seen only on the CC view medially at far-posterior depth. It is more commonly unilateral. 

• 
The main differential consideration is a medial mass; however, the characteristic shape and lack of corresponding finding on the lateral or MLO views is usually sufficient to diagnose a 


sternalis muscle. MRI can be performed in ambiguous cases. 
Accessory nipple (polythelia) 
• 
An accessory nipple (polythelia) is seen in approximately 2% of neonates and may present on mammography as a rounded mass along the mammary crest. 

• 
Physical exam is diagnostic. 


Accessory breast tissue 
• Accessory or ectopic breast tissue occurs in 2–6% of women and is most common in the axilla. It may be unilateral or bilateral. 
Poland syndrome 
• Poland syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by unilateral absence of the pectoralis major muscle, often associated with ipsilateral absence of breast tissue
