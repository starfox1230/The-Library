Breast masses 
• 
Often a synthesis of the three major breast imaging modalities (mammography, ultrasound, MRI) is required to make a diagnosis. Therefore, a solid understanding of the previous sections and ways in which these modalities are used, including the appropriate BI-RADS terminology, is crucial. 

• 
Commonly tested breast masses and their characteristic imaging features are described below. 


Fatty masses 
• All entirely fat-density circumscribed masses are benign (BI-RADS 2). 
Lipoma 

Lipoma: Mammogram shows a circumscribed oval mass that is almost entirely lucent (arrows). Ultrasound shows a circumscribed oval mass (calipers) with internal echotexture identical to the surrounding fat. 
• 
A lipoma is a benign lesion composed of mature adipocytes. 

• 
Clinically, a lipoma may present as a palpable mass. 

• 
Mammography is sufficient to make the diagnosis of a benign lipoma and will demonstrate a radiolucent mass that may have a thin discrete rim. In contrast to an oil cyst, a lipoma will not exhibit peripheral calcification. 

• 
Ultrasound is not necessary when mammographic features are diagnostic, however, it may be utilized when a palpable lipoma is not clearly evident on mammography or in a very young, pregnant or male patient. A lipoma will appear as an oval isoechoic or hyperechoic 


mass with a circumscribed margin on ultrasound. 
Oil cyst (fat necrosis) 

Mammogram shows a radiolucent mass with a fine peripherally calcified rim, consistent with an oil cyst. 
• An oil cyst is a form of fat necrosis and can occur post-trauma or surgery. Fat necrosis can have many imaging appearances, most commonly dystrophic calcification. The formation of an oil cyst following fat necrosis is less common but has a distinctive appearance. 
Breast: 412 

Oil cyst (fat necrosis; continued) 
• 
Mammography will demonstrate a circumscribed, lucent lesion that can peripherally calcify. 

• 
When the mammographic appearance is diagnostic, ultrasound is not necessary, but will show a round or oval circumscribed mass. The entire spectrum of internal echogenicities are possible: anechoic, hypoechoic, hyperechoic, complex cystic and solid, or heterogeneous. If the wall of the oil cyst is fibrotic or calcified, there may be posterior acoustic shadowing. 

• 
On MRI, an oil cyst will demonstrate internal fat signal, and may have rim enhancement. 




Fat-containing circumscribed masses 
• Like purely fatty masses, all fat-containing circumscribed masses are benign (BI-RADS 2). 
Hamartoma (fibroadenolipoma) 

Mammogram (left image) demonstrates an oval mass containing fat and glandular elements, surrounded by a thin pseudocapsule (arrows). Ultrasound of the same area demonstrates an oval, heterogeneous echotexture hypoechoic and hyperechoic mass with circumscribed margins (calipers). 
• A hamartoma, also known as a fibroadenolipoma, is a benign mass containing fat and glandular tissue elements. It is often described as a “breast within a breast” as it is composed of the same elements as the normal breast, but in a focal area demarcated by a 
pseudocapsule. 
• 
The classic mammographic appearance is an oval mass of mixed soft tissue and fat density with circumscribed margins. The surrounding pseudocapsule may be visible as a thin radiodense line when fat inside the lesion and outside the lesion are adjacent.  

• 
Mammography is almost always diagnostic, but familiarity with the ultrasound appearance is important as it may be the first exam performed in younger patients presenting with a palpable hamartoma. At ultrasound, a hamartoma will be seen as an oval circumscribed heterogeneous echotexture (mixed hypoechoic and hyperechoic) lesion with a subtle thin 


echogenic pseudocapsule. 
• Because fibroglandular elements are present within a hamartoma, it is possible (but rare) for breast cancer to occur within a hamartoma. Any suspicious mass or calcifications within 
a hamartoma should be worked up. 
Galactocele 
• 
A galactocele is a cystic collection of milk that can present as a palpable mass in a lactating woman. 

• 
On mammography, a galactocele typically appears as an oval mass with circumscribed margins. This may be soft tissue density, fat density or mixed density  with a fat-fluid level. If a palpable mass in a lactating patient is fat density or has a fat-fluid level it is benign. 


Galactocele (continued) 

Mammogram (left image) shows a circumscribed, oval mass containing both high density and fat. A fat-fluid level (arrow) is specific for a galactocele. Ultrasound shows a complex cystic and solid mass (calipers). 
• On ultrasound, a galactocele may have a variable appearance. If ultrasound shows a hypoechoic, heterogeneous or complex cystic mass and mammography does not confirm fat to be present, aspiration or core biopsy is indicated. If aspiration is performed, the obtained fluid would be milky. 
Intramammary lymph node 

Mammogram (left image) shows a circumscribed, reniform mass (arrow), highly suggestive of an intramammary lymph node. Ultrasound (in a different patient) of an intramammary lymph node shows an oval, circumscribed mass with a central echogenic fatty hilum (arrow). 
• 
An intramammary lymph node is benign normal structure within the breast. The vast majority of intramammary lymph nodes occur in the upper outer quadrant. An adjacent vessel entering the fatty hilum can sometimes be seen, especially on tomographic imaging. 

• 
On mammography, an intramammary lymph node should have a characteristic reniform shape with a fatty hilum (a lucent notch in the middle). If the hilum is not visible, a full workup should be performed including spot compression and/or ultrasound, particularly if location is atypical for an intramammary node. 

• 
Typically, a normal intramammary lymph node with a fatty hilum can be diagnosed with confidence on mammography, but ultrasound can be useful as a problem-solving tool. 

• 
Ultrasound will show a hypoechoic mass with central echogenicity that represents the fatty hilum. Color Doppler imaging would show vessels coursing into the hilum. 

• 
Note that while normal intramammary lymph nodes are only sometimes seen within the breast, there are almost always lymph nodes present in the axilla. If there is unilateral axillary lymph node enlargement and/or abnormal morphology, concern should be raised for ipsilateral breast cancer. Bilateral enlarged axillary lymph nodes are unlikely to be caused by breast cancer and may be due to systemic inflammatory or neoplastic disease, such as collagen vascular disease or lymphoma. 




Cystic breast lesions 
• Note that it is not possible to reliably differentiate cystic versus solid lesions  on mammography. However, a cyst may become less dense on spot compression owing to its compressibility. 
Simple cyst 

Simple cyst: Mammogram shows a circumscribed, round, isodense mass underlying a radiodense cutaneous marker. Ultrasound shows an anechoic, oval, circumscribed structure with an imperceptibly thin wall and 
posterior enhancement. 
• 
A simple cyst is a benign, fluid-filled structure that is round or oval in shape, with circumscribed margins and anechoic internal echo pattern. Two to three gentle lobulations may be present. A cyst features an imperceptibly thin wall and posterior through-transmission (posterior enhancement). 

• 
A cyst that meets all the above criteria is benign and can be classified as BI-RADS 2. 

• 
A simple cyst causing pain or discomfort may be aspirated. 


Complicated cyst 

Complicated cysts in two different patients: The complicated cyst on the left features low-level internal echoes (yellow arrow), while the complicated cyst on the right demonstrates layering debris with a fluid level (red arrows). 
• 
A complicated cyst is a cyst that contains low-level internal echoes or layering debris, but otherwise meets criteria similar to a simple cyst. 

• 
A complicated cyst is highly likely to be benign, with risk of malignancy below 2%. If solitary, a complicated cyst may be classified as probably benign (BI-RADS 3). If multiple and bilateral, it is reasonable to classify them as benign (BI-RADS 2). 

• 
Occasionally, a complicated cyst may be difficult to differentiate from a solid mass with homogeneous internal echoes or may not meet all the required criteria. In such a case, aspiration or core biopsy is typically performed. If aspirated fluid is white, clear, or yellow, the fluid is presumed benign and discarded. Bloody fluid is sent for cytology. 


Clustered microcysts 

Clustered microcysts: 
Ultrasound shows a cystic lesion (calipers) composed of several small 2–3 mm cysts with thin septations 
and no solid component. 
• 
Thought to be due to apocrine metaplasia or fibrocystic change, clustered microcysts are composed of several adjacent tiny 2–5 mm cystic spaces separated by thin (<0.5 mm) septae. 

• 
Clustered microcysts can be classified as BI-RADS 3 if well seen with no solid component and no associated internal vascularity. 

• 
Clustered microcysts may eventually evolve into a simple benign cyst. 



Complex cystic and solid mass 

Ultrasound shows a mixed cystic and solid mass (calipers) with an irregular solid component (arrows). Although the mass is oval in shape and has circumscribed margins, the solid component makes this lesion suspicious for malignancy. 
• 
The BI-RADS term complex cystic and solid mass describes a cyst with any solid feature, including thick walls or septations, or any solid or nodular element. 

• 
A complex cystic and solid mass is a suspicious BI-RADS 4 lesion that should be biopsied. The solid component should be targeted with a core needle and a post-biopsy tissue marker 


should be placed. 
• 
36% of complex cystic and solid masses will be cancer upon biopsy. 

• 
Malignancies that may present as a complex cystic and solid mass include DCIS, encapsulated papillary carcinoma, high grade phyllodes tumor, and invasive carcinoma with central necrosis (common for high grade triple negative breast cancers). 

• 
Benign causes of a complex cystic and solid mass include papilloma, hematoma, abscess, fat necrosis, galactocele, and benign cyst with adherent debris. 




Round or oval solid masses 
Fibroadenoma 

Two different patients with fibroadenomas: On the left is an ultrasound image demonstrating the typical appearance of a fibroadenoma in a young woman, as a circumscribed, oval, parallel, hypoechoic mass with 
mild posterior enhancement. 
On the right is the characteristic mammographic appearance of a hyalinized fibroadenoma in an older woman (top right), as a circumscribed mass with coarse “popcorn-like” calcifications. This appearance is completely diagnostic and no further workup is necessary. Ultrasound (below right) was performed as this lesion was palpable, as evident by the triangular skin marker on the mammogram. Note the calcifications within the mass (arrows). 
• 
Fibroadenoma is a benign neoplasm common in young women under age 35 and is the most frequent cause of a palpable breast mass in this age group. 

• 
Clinically, a fibroadenoma will present as a firm, mobile mass. 

• 
The classic mammographic appearance of a fibroadenoma is an oval, equal density circumscribed mass, although this imaging appearance is nonspecific. A hyalinizing fibroadenoma, typically seen in older women, has a definitively benign mammographic appearance containing coarse “popcorn-like” calcification. 

• 
The typical ultrasound appearance of a fibroadenoma is an oval, circumscribed mass with homogeneous hypoechoic echotexture. Occasionally, a histologically benign fibroadenoma may have more suspicious features on ultrasound including irregular margins, heterogeneous internal echotexture, or shadowing, prompting biopsy in these cases. 

• 
On MRI, fibroadenoma typically appears as an oval, circumscribed mass with iso- or hyperintense T2 signal and persistent (type I) enhancement. Dark internal septations are specific for fibroadenoma. 

• 
Masses presenting with imaging features typical of a fibroadenoma are often either followed (BI-RADS 3) or biopsied (BI-RADS 4), depending on the imaging characteristics and clinical context. 

• 
If the following ultrasound features are met, the presumed fibroadenoma can be classified 


as BI-RADS 3, with a false negative rate of 0.5%: Ovoid shape, parallel orientation with a width to height ratio of >1.4 (wider-than-tall). 
All margins circumscribed. 
Not highly hypoechoic. 
• 
Variants of fibroadenoma include juvenile fibroadenoma and giant fibroadenoma. A juvenile fibroadenoma is seen in adolescents and is characterized by very rapid growth. A giant fibroadenoma is a fibroadenoma greater than 8 cm in size. 

• 
Fibroadenoma may appear identical to a phyllodes tumor, especially when larger. Breast: 417 


Epidermal inclusion cyst 

Cleavage view mammogram (left image) shows a round mass in the parasternal region. Targeted ultrasound demonstrates an oval hypoechoic lesion partially situated in the dermis with associated claw sign (arrows), consistent with an epidermal inclusion cyst. 
• Discussed earlier under the “Breast Ultrasound” section, an epidermal inclusion cyst can present as a round or oval mass on mammography, although it has a typical sonographic 
appearance. 
Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH) 
• Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH) is a benign entity of unknown etiology composed of stromal and myofibroblast proliferation, thought to be under hormonal 
control. 
• 
On mammography and ultrasound, PASH appears as a round or oval noncalcified mass with circumscribed or indistinct margins. It can also present as an asymmetry or focal asymmetry. 

• 
MRI features of PASH are nonspecific. However, the presence of high T2 signal slit-like spaces and cystic components favor a diagnosis of PASH. Persistent (type I) enhancement pattern is often associated with PASH. 

• 
PASH has no malignant potential. Growth and recurrence after excision are not uncommon. While clinical management of PASH remains controversial, most patients undergo follow-up 


imaging. 
Intraductal papilloma 

Axial MRI (left image) shows a round enhancing mass in the inner right breast at anterior depth (arrow). Targeted ultrasound (right images) of this region demonstrates an oval, hypoechoic mass with circumscribed margins and internal vascularity on Doppler. Biopsy revealed intraductal papilloma without atypia. 
• A papilloma is a benign tumor of lactiferous ducts, usually seen in women between ages 30 and 50. Papillomas that occur in the larger retroareolar ducts are referred to as solitary papillomas. Those that occur in the terminal aspect of the duct system are referred to as multiple papillomas. 
Intraductal papilloma (continued) 
• 
Solitary papillomas are the most common cause of pathologic (bloody, serous, or serosanguinous) nipple discharge. They grow on a fibrovascular stalk and torsion of the stalk can cause pain and bleeding. Note that DCIS may also present with bloody nipple discharge. 

• 
The mammographic appearance of a papilloma includes a round or oval, predominantly circumscribed mass, a tubular structure/focally dilated duct, and calcifications, either alone or in association with a mass or dilated duct. 

• 
The majority of papillomas that present with nipple discharge are mammographically occult, but if visible on imaging are usually in the more anterior, retroareolar region. 

• 
On ultrasound, a papilloma may appear as a round or oval hypoechoic or complex cystic mass. When causing nipple discharge, the papilloma may be evident as an isoechoic or hypoechoic mass in a fluid-filled duct. 

• 
In patients presenting with nipple discharge with no visible findings on mammography or ultrasound, galactography or contrast-enhanced MRI may be utilized for further evaluation. Galactography can demonstrate a filling defect within the opacified discharging duct. MRI may show an intraductal enhancing mass with washout kinetics. The duct may be filled with fluid (T2 hyperintense) or blood (T1 hyperintense on pre-contrast). Papillomas may also present as an enhancing focus or round or oval mass, often with wash-out kinetics. 

• 
Follow-up of biopsied benign papilloma (without atypia) is controversial. For papillomas with atypia or other suspicious features, surgical excision is recommended. 



Breast cancer 
• 
It is uncommon for breast carcinoma to be circumscribed, but a new circumscribed mass must prompt suspicion especially in a post-menopausal woman. 

• 
Several subtypes of breast cancer that can present as a round or oval, circumscribed mass on mammography include triple negative breast cancer, medullary, mucinous, and papillary 


carcinoma. 

Metastasis 
• 
A solitary metastasis to the breast is much more frequently seen than multiple metastases. 

• 
A hematogenous metastasis most commonly presents as a circumscribed round mass. 

• 
Melanoma and renal cell carcinoma have a propensity to metastasize to the breast. 



CC mammogram (left image) shows a high-density, round, circumscribed mass in the inner breast.  Targeted ultrasound shows a complex cystic and solid mass with angular and indistinct margins (arrows). Biopsy revealed metastatic melanoma. 


Large circumscribed masses, greater than 3 cm 
• Size is a poor predictor of malignancy for solid circumscribed masses; however, there are some specific entities that tend to be large on presentation. 
Giant fibroadenoma 
• 
A giant fibroadenoma is simply a large fibroadenoma >8 cm in size which is otherwise similar in appearance. 

• 
A juvenile fibroadenoma is a rapidly growing fibroadenoma variant seen in adolescents, which may become giant. 


Phyllodes tumor 
• 
A phyllodes tumor (previously called cystosarcoma phyllodes) is a rare, rapidly growing tumor that is typically large when first detected. 

• 
Phyllodes tumors tend to occur in an older population in comparison to fibroadenomas, typically in women age 40–50. 

• 
The typical mammographic appearance of phyllodes tumor is a large, oval, circumscribed mass. 

• 
The typical ultrasonographic appearance of phyllodes tumor is a circumscribed mass with heterogeneous internal echotexture. The imaging differential of such a mass includes a large fibroadenoma or cancer. 

• 
The majority of phyllodes tumors are benign, although approximately 25% are malignant and 20% of those may metastasize. Since imaging cannot distinguish between benign and malignant phyllodes, treatment is wide surgical excision. Incomplete excision leads to 


recurrence. 
Lactating adenoma 

• 
Lactating adenomas are seen in the second or third trimester of pregnancy or the postpartum period. 

• 
Patients present with a freely mobile mass, which may be tender if it has rapidly enlarged. 

• 
A lactating adenoma is benign and does not need excision after biopsy. It regresses after the patient is no longer lactating. 



Hematoma/seroma 
• 
Breast hematoma and seroma can be iatrogenic or post-traumatic. They appear as round or oval masses and should decrease in size over time. 

• 
An acute hematoma may appear high-density on mammogram. On ultrasound, both hematoma and seroma should be fluid-filled, avascular, and may contain debris, fluid-fluid levels, or septa. 


Triple-negative breast cancer 
• Triple-negative breast cancer typically presents with a larger size than other subtypes of breast cancer, and is associated with aggressive clinical course and poor outcome. 


Multiple breast masses 
Multiple bilateral circumscribed breast masses 

MLO view digital breast tomosynthesis images show multiple oval circumscribed masses in bilateral breasts. These were found to represent cysts on targeted ultrasound. 
• Multiple bilateral circumscribed breast masses are defined as at least three circumscribed masses, with at least one in each breast. None should have disproportionate size, density or margins in comparison to the others, have any associated suspicious findings or show interval growth when others remain stable. Common underlying origin for these masses is multiple cysts or fibroadenomas. 
• 
Multiple bilateral circumscribed masses are seen in up to 1.7% of screening mammograms, and up to 6.2% of patients undergoing screening ultrasound. 

• 
The interval cancer rate in setting of multiple bilateral circumscribed masses with the criteria detailed above has been shown to be between 0–0.14%. Therefore, if no concerning imaging features are present, multiple bilateral circumscribed breast masses can be classified as benign (BI-RADS 2). However, if any mass demonstrates suspicious features, such as spiculated or indistinct margins or increasing size, further workup is required. 

• 
Criteria for management of multiple bilateral breast masses detected with MRI, contrast-enhanced mammography, or nuclear breast imaging have not yet been defined. 


Multiple intraductal papillomas 

• Multiple intraductal papillomas tend to occur in younger patients compared to solitary papillomas. When multiple, papillomas tend to be more peripheral in location and bilateral. In contrast to solitary papillomas, multiple papillomas are infrequently associated with 
pathologic nipple discharge. 
• 
Multiple intraductal papillomas confer slightly increased risk of breast cancer. 

• 
Depending on the size of each of these multiple intraductal lesions, they may or may not be visible on imaging; therefore, the mammographic appearance may be a single or multiple round or oval circumscribed mass(es) located in the more peripheral breast. Given the ductal origin of these lesions, they may show a segmental distribution. 

• 
Two similarly named entities have potentially confusing terminology. Papillomatosis is a term that is frequently mistaken with multiple intraductal papillomas. Papillomatosis 


represents microscopic foci of intraductal hyperplasia with a papillary architecture. It is a pathologic diagnosis rather than an imaging finding. Juvenile papillomatosis is a rare cause of a mass that resembles a fibroadenoma in adolescents or 
younger women up to age 40. 
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) 
• DCIS can present as multiple masses, typically in segmental distribution. 

Metastasis 
• Multiple new masses in a non­ductal distribution are concerning 
for hematogenous metastases 
from a non-breast primary, though this occurs less often than solitary 
metastasis. 
segmental distribution on mammography. 

Multiple skin lesions: neurofibromatosis 
• 
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous 

disease that features pigmentary changes (e.g., café au lait spots and Lisch nodules) and neurofibromas. 

• 
Cutaneous neurofibromas are the hallmarks of NF1, thought to arise from 


small nerve tributaries of the skin. 
• On mammography, multiple cutaneous neurofibromas may appear as multiple skin masses outlined by air. 


Multiple skin lesions: steatocystoma multiplex 
• Steatocystoma multiplex is a rare, autosomal dominant disease of multiple intradermal cysts containing sebum. When the skin over the breasts is involved, mammography shows innumerable fat-density masses. 


Patient with known diagnosis of steatocystoma multiplex: MLO and CC view mammograms show multiple subcutaneous fat-density masses in the left breast and axilla. 


Irregular/spiculated masses 
Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) 

Invasive ductal cancer: Spot compression mammography (left image) demonstrates a high density, irregular mass with spiculated margins and associated architectural distortion (circle). Targeted ultrasound shows an irregular, hypoechoic mass (arrows) with indistinct margins and taller-than-wide orientation. 
• 
Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common form of breast cancer. A typical mammographic appearance of IDC is a high density, spiculated mass. Malignant-type (e.g., pleomorphic or fine linear branching) calcifications may be present within the mass. 

• 
It is important to remember that IDC can have a variable imaging appearance and may also present as a round mass, as isolated calcifications, as architectural distortion, or any combination of these findings. 

• 
Subtypes of IDC carry different prognoses and are discussed earlier in the chapter. 


Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) 
• 
Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) represents approximately 10% of all breast cancers and can be challenging to diagnose, with a false-negative mammography rate as high as 21%. ILC tends to spread in an infiltrating pattern surrounding the glandular tissue, thus making its detection by mammogram or physical exam often quite difficult. 

• 
The imaging appearance of ILC is variable. Similar to IDC, ILC may present as a mass (with or without spiculation) or subtle architectural distortion (which may be seen in one view only). In contrast to IDC, ILC rarely contains microcalcifications. 

• 
ILC is more often multifocal or bilateral compared to IDC. 


Tubular carcinoma 
• 
Tubular carcinoma is a slow-growing subtype of IDC that typically presents as a small, spiculated mass. The imaging appearance may remain stable across several prior mammograms, which emphasizes the fact that a malignant-appearing finding must be fully evaluated even if stability is demonstrated. 

• 
Prognosis of tubular carcinoma is more favorable compared to IDC NOS. 


Radial scar (complex sclerosing lesion) 

Radial scar: MLO mammogram (left image) shows subtle architectural distortion in the upper breast at middle to posterior depth (circle). Spot compression (right image) better shows architectural distortion (circle). 
• 
A radial scar is a benign proliferative lesion of the breast. Despite the name, a radial scar has nothing to do with a post-traumatic or post-surgical scar. A complex sclerosing lesion is histologically identical to a radial scar, but is used to describe those that are larger (>1 cm). 

• 
Histologically, a radial scar is characterized by adenosis, hyperplasia, and central atrophy resulting in pulling-in of adjacent tissue into a stellate pattern. 

• 
The mammographic and ultrasound appearance of a radial scar may be identical to cancer, appearing as a spiculated mass or architectural distortion (sometimes with associated calcifications) on mammography and a hypoechoic shadowing mass on ultrasound. Radial 


scars can also show enhancement on MRI. Although the classic appearance of a radial scar 
on mammography is an area of architectural distortion with central lucency, this appearance is not diagnostically reliable, and biopsy is always warranted. 
• Management of radial scars diagnosed by core needle biopsy remains controversial due to varying reported upgrade rates. The most common management is surgical excision. 
Post-lumpectomy or post-excisional biopsy scar 
• 
A post-surgical scar, either due to prior lumpectomy or excisional biopsy, may be indistinguishable on mammography from cancer in the absence of clinical history. 

• 
Additional post-surgical changes are often present to aid in the diagnosis, including volume loss in the treated breast and skin retraction. Additionally, unlike recurrent tumor, a post-surgical scar should not get larger over time. 

• 
If the patient was treated with radiation therapy, dystrophic calcification and skin thickening/retraction may also be present. 




Axillary mass 
Axillary lymphadenopathy 

Malignant adenopathy: MLO mammogram (left image) shows numerous round, high density masses in the axilla, with the suggestion of indistinct margins of the superior-most mass (arrows). Ultrasound demonstrates several enlarged lymph nodes with asymmetrically thickened cortex measuring up to 1 cm (calipers). 
• 
Unilaterally enlarged axillary lymph nodes are suspicious for breast cancer metastasis, although size alone is nonspecific for determining metastatic involvement. 

• 
Sonographic features suspicious of lymph node metastasis include: 

• 
Bilateral adenopathy is more likely to be due to a systemic process, including collagen vascular disease, lymphoma, leukemia, metastases from nonbreast primary, and infection. 


Round shape.  Focal outwards cortical bulge.  
Thickened (>3 mm) cortex.  Hilar indentation or obliteration of the hilum by  
Eccentrically thickened cortex.  thickened cortex.  

Breast mass in the axilla 
• The axillary tail of Spence is normal extension of fibroglandular tissue into the axilla. Accessory breast tissue can also separately occur in the axilla. These can be mistaken as a mass on physical exam. Alternatively, any associated primary benign or malignant process of 
the breast can also occur here and present as a mass. 

Skin lesions 
• Epidermal inclusion cysts and sebaceous cysts (discussed in detail earlier in the chapter) are commonly seen in the axilla though they can occur anywhere. Another common location is the inframammary fold. 


Other malignant disease of the breast 
Angiosarcoma

• Angiosarcoma of the breast is a rare and aggressive malignancy that may be primary in 
origin, or secondary to prior breast conservation therapy with radiation. Primary angiosarcoma arises in the breast parenchyma and can present as a palpable mass or diffuse 
breast enlargement without a mass. 
Radiation-associated angiosarcoma arises in the breast dermis and subcutis, presenting as areas of skin thickening and ecchymosis that can mimic bruising, thereby delaying diagnosis. 
• Mammographic and ultrasound findings of radiation-associated angiosarcoma are nonspecific. On MRI, angiosarcoma is hyperintense on T2-weighted images and 
demonstrates intense enhancement. 
Lymphoma 
• 
The most common primary breast lymphoma is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Clinically, most breast lymphomas present as a palpable mass. Axillary adenopathy may be present. 

• 
On mammography, lymphoma may present as a mass with indistinct margins. On ultrasound, lymphoma typically appears as a hypoechoic mass. In contrast to epithelial cancers such as invasive ductal carcinoma, calcifications are rarely seen in breast lymphoma. 

• 
In a patient with a known diagnosis of lymphoma and a new breast mass, the primary consideration remains breast cancer. Histologic sampling is essential as lymphoma is treated with chemoradiation, not surgery. 

• 
Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a rare primary T-cell lymphoma of the breast. It is most often seen with textured breast implants and classically presents as an effusion around the implant or residual fibrous capsule. Therefore, any new peri-implant effusion occurring more than 12 months following implant placement should prompt consideration for this rare entity.
