Breast MRI 
Introduction 
Overview of clinical role of breast MRI 
• 
Breast MRI plays a complementary role to mammography in the evaluation of breast cancer. 

• 
Contrast-enhanced breast MRI features excellent soft tissue contrast and high sensitivity for the detection of cancer. Although the distinction between normal or benign structures and malignancy is often not apparent using standard T1- and T2-weighted sequences, the addition of dynamic contrast enhancement greatly increases the accuracy for detection of malignancy. 

• 
One of the greatest challenges facing the evolving field of breast MRI is the overlap in imaging findings between benign and malignant lesions. Both tumors and benign lesions may enhance and may exhibit similar morphologic characteristics. Strategies such as the characterization of enhancement kinetic curves and development of a stringent BI-RADS lexicon help to tackle this problem. 


One relative weakness of MRI compared to mammography is the lack of sensitivity to microcalcifications. While some larger calcifications can be detected as susceptibility artifact, mammography is superior to MRI for detection of small calcifications. 
• In clinical use to evaluate for breast cancer, standard 1.5 or 3 Tesla breast MRI has been shown to have very high negative predictive values and relatively low false positive rates. 
Breast MRI technique 
• 
The risk stratification of an enhancing lesion involves separate evaluation of the lesion morphology (including morphologic description of the enhancement pattern) and the kinetic pattern of enhancement. 

• 
Breast MRI is performed with the patient prone using a dedicated breast coil. Imaging of both breasts should be performed simultaneously unless the patient has had a previous mastectomy. Bilateral imaging is very helpful to distinguish background parenchymal 


enhancement from pathological enhancement. 
• 
Standard sequences include T1- and T2-weighted images, with and without fat saturation. Essential to the breast MRI exam are the pre- and post-contrast images, which are typically obtained using fat saturation. Dynamic enhanced images are obtained sequentially to evaluate for enhancement over time. 

• 
Intraductal fluid may be hyperintense on T1-weighted images, complicating the evaluation of enhancement. Post-processing is required to evaluate for true enhancement. 

• 
The simplest form of post-processing is subtraction, where the dynamic post-contrast images are subtracted from the initial T1-weighted fat-saturated images. 

• 
The maximum-intensity projection (MIP) image is a useful post-processing tool based on the subtraction images. A MIP highlights the brightest pixel along each parallel ray to create a volumetric data set where the enhancement can easily be seen in three-dimensional 


space. 
• Computer-aided detection (CAD) is a helpful adjunct for analysis of contrast-enhanced MRI sequences. CAD allows creation of a color angiomap, assigning colors to different temporal patterns of enhancement and allowing further characterization of a lesion to help determine the level of suspicion for malignancy. 

Screening for breast cancer in women at increased risk 
• 
Screening for cancer in high-risk patients is an accepted indication for breast MRI. High risk is defined as a 20% or greater lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. There are several models for risk prediction taking into account family history, gene mutations, and exposures such as thoracic radiation (typically administered for treatment of lymphoma). BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation carriers (or untested first-degree relatives of a confirmed carrier) are high risk, with 50–85% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. 

• 
MRI has been shown to detect occult breast cancer in 2–5% of high-risk women. 


Staging of known cancer 
• 
In patients with an established diagnosis of breast cancer, MRI can be helpful to evaluate the extent of disease and can change clinical management. 

• 
The presence of two or more sites of cancer in one quadrant (multifocal disease) may preclude breast conservation, depending on the size of the breast. MRI has been reported to find additional cancer in the same quadrant in 1–20% of women. 

• 
The presence of cancer in more than one quadrant (multicentric disease) usually requires mastectomy. Unsuspected multicentric disease was found by MRI in 2–24% of women. 

• 
MRI can accurately measure tumor size and has the highest correlation with pathology specimens when compared to ultrasound or mammography, which tend to underestimate the true size. 

• 
MRI can assess for the presence of enlarged or abnormal axillary lymph nodes. 

• 
MRI can evaluate for pectoralis or intercostal muscle invasion. 



Pectoralis muscle invasion: Axial (left image) and sagittal contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed MRI shows an ill-defined enhancing mass (yellow arrows) in the far posterior breast with loss of normal fat plane separating the posterior fibroglandular tissue from the pectoralis muscle. There is associated abnormal enhancement of the pectoralis muscle itself (red arrows). 

Evaluation for recurrent or residual disease 
• 
Breast conservation therapy combines lumpectomy with radiation therapy and is the treatment of choice for most early stage breast cancers. If resection margins after lumpectomy pathologically show remaining tumor, MRI can evaluate for the extent of residual disease, which may manifest as small nodular areas of enhancement around the lumpectomy site. 

• 
Normal enhancement following lumpectomy can be seen for up to 18 months due to granulation tissue. Suspicious features include enhancement beyond 18 months or new enhancement after the initial post-operative enhancement has subsided. 



Evaluation for recurrent or residual disease (continued) 
• 
Breast MRI is also commonly performed following breast cancer treatment to evaluate for local recurrence or a metachronous primary in the ipsilateral or contralateral breast. 

• 
Local recurrence rates at 15 years are 12% for women who received radiation and 36% for women who did not receive radiation. 



Contralateral second primary after mastectomy: Unilateral contrast-enhanced fat-saturated T1-weighted MRI of the left breast in a patient with previous mastectomy shows a new irregular, enhancing mass with irregular margins (arrows). 
Evaluation of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
• 
Neoadjuvant therapy is employed to reduce the size of large tumors prior to resection. Follow-up MRI performed even after one or two cycles of chemotherapy can evaluate if the patient has responded to chemotherapy. 

• 
Cytotoxic therapy may reduce tumor vascularity, which will often alter the enhancement kinetics of a lesion. 

• 
After completion of neoadjuvant therapy, MRI can detect the location and extent of residual disease to guide surgical planning. 


Diagnostic problem solving 
• In certain situations, MRI can be useful for problem solving after a thorough mammographic and ultrasound workup remains indeterminate. For instance, an asymmetry that persists after spot compression but is not localizable on an orthogonal view or by ultrasound may be assessed by MRI. 
Evaluation of silicone implants 
• 
MRI has the highest sensitivity and specificity for evaluation of silicone implant rupture. Unlike the standard breast mass protocol, no gadolinium is administered for an implant evaluation and this exam does not evaluate for cancer. 

• 
Saline implants are typically evaluated by physical exam, mammography, and ultrasound. MRI is not indicated. 



Overview of BI-RADS lexicon for MRI masses 
• 
The mammographic and MRI lexicons have several terms in common to describe mass shape and margin. However, since MRI incorporates dynamic contrast enhancement, new terminology was developed to describe a mass’s internal pattern of enhancement. 

•A 
mass is defined as a space-occupying lesion that displaces normal breast parenchyma. 


Mass shape 
• 
The MRI lexicon for mass shape is identical to that of mammography and ultrasound. 

• 
Round: Spherical in shape. 

• 
Oval: Elliptical or oblong in shape. May include two to three undulations in contour. 

• 
Irregular: Uneven shape. An irregular shape is suspicious for malignancy. 


Mass margin 
• 
Evaluation of the margin of an enhancing mass is the MRI imaging feature most predictive of malignancy. The BI-RADS MRI lexicon for mass margin includes circumscribed, irregular, and spiculated. Unlike the mammography lexicon which uses the word irregular only to describe mass shape, irregular is used in the MRI lexicon as a description of both mass shape and mass margin. Circumscribed margins are more suggestive of benignity, while not circumscribed (irregular or spiculated) margins are more suspicious for malignancy. A mass with spiculated margins is thought to represent cancer 84–91% of the time. 

• 
The shape and margin of a mass are best evaluated in the early postcontrast sequences. Progressive enhancement of the normal surrounding breast parenchyma on the subsequent postcontrast sequences may obscure the true margins of a mass. 



Internal enhancement 
• 
Several descriptive terms unique to breast MRI are used to describe the internal enhancement pattern within a mass. 

• 
Homogeneous internal enhancement is uniform and can be seen in both benign and malignant lesions. 

• 
Heterogeneous internal enhancement describes non-uniform enhancement within the lesion and is suspicious, especially in the presence of rim enhancement. 

• 
Rim enhancement is a highly suspicious finding for cancer, representing malignancy in up to 84% of cases, although this finding is only seen in 16% of cancers. Potential pitfalls are a peripherally enhancing inflammatory cyst or fat necrosis, both of which can demonstrate 


rim enhancement and are discussed later in the chapter. 
• Dark internal septations are highly specific for a benign fibroadenoma (>95% positive predictive value). A fibroadenoma will also typically be circumscribed and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. A hyalinizing fibroadenoma, typically seen in older women, rarely 
enhances.

Enhancement 


MRI focus 
• 
A focus is a small dot of enhancement <5 mm in size that does not have any mass effect or correlate on  pre-contrast images. A focus is too small for accurate assessment of margins or internal enhancement characteristics. 

• 
It can be difficult to differentiate a single focus from normal background parenchymal enhancement (BPE). Multiple bilateral enhancing foci may be due to BPE and are generally considered benign. Some authors advocate for assigning a conspicuous, isolated focus as BI­RADS 3. 

• 
It is generally not possible to characterize enhancement kinetics of a focus by CAD due to its small size; however, if kinetics appear to be washout based on manual measurements then suspicion should be raised. If a focus has any suspicious features, it should be described as a mass even if less than 5 mm. 


Overview of non-mass enhancement 
• 
Non-mass enhancement (NME) is an enhancing region that is not a mass or a focus. 

• 
Similar to mammographic calcifications, NME is described both in terms of distribution and morphology. The purpose of the lexicon for NME is to distinguish between malignancy and benign parenchymal enhancement or fibrocystic changes. 



NME distribution 
• 
Focal: Distribution is <25% of a quadrant and contains interspersed fat/glandular tissue. 

• 
Linear: The distribution is arranged in a line or branching pattern. Linear distribution is up to 26% malignant and can suggest enhancement associated with a duct. 

• 
Segmental: Triangular-shaped distribution of enhancement pointing towards the nipple. Segmental distribution also suggests a ductal etiology. Segmental distribution is the most common distribution of DCIS (42% of DCIS cases). 

• 
Regional: Geographic distribution involving at least a quadrant, implying involvement of multiple ductal systems. 

• 
Multiple regions: At least two regions of NME are present, with interspersed normal tissue. 

• 
Diffuse: Uniform NME is present throughout the breast. A diffuse distribution of NME may represent prominent background parenchymal enhancement, but can also be seen with extensive malignancy. 


NME internal enhancement patterns 
• 
Homogeneous: Enhancement intensity is uniform throughout the NME. This pattern is more suggestive of a benign lesion than heterogeneous, but small cancers may enhance homogeneously. 

• 
Heterogeneous: Enhancement is confluent and non-uniform in morphology. Heterogeneous NME is seen in 21% of cases of DCIS. 

• 
Clumped: Resembling a cobblestone pattern, or  a “bunch of grapes.” Clumped enhancement is most suggestive of DCIS, especially in a linear or segmental distribution. Clumped NME is seen in 51% of cases of DCIS and necessitates biopsy. 

• 
Clustered ring: Thin rings of enhancing tissue surrounding the ducts. This is a suspicious pattern.

• 
Tumor angiogenesis and resultant capillary permeability would be theoretically expected to cause rapid enhancement and washout. This principle is the foundation for kinetic analysis in dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI. 

• 
After repeated imaging of the breast at multiple time points (dynamic contrast-enhanced sequence), enhancement curves can be generated by plotting percent relative enhancement (compared to the unenhanced image) against time. The enhancement curve is divided into early (within the first two minutes) and delayed phases. 

• 
Per the BI-RADS lexicon, the kinetics of early enhancement can be characterized as slow, medium, and rapid. A malignant lesion would be expected to have rapid early enhancement. 

• 
Analysis of the delayed phase of enhancement allows one to further stratify the risk of malignancy. The three kinetic patterns of delayed enhancement are: Persistent (type I), plateau (type II), and washout (type III). 

• 
A type I (persistent) curve shows continuously increasing (>10%) enhancement in the delayed phase. Although a type I curve is associated with a benign finding in 83% of cases, up to 9% of malignant lesions may feature a type I curve. 

• 
A type II (plateau) curve has an early rise in enhancement, but levels off (within 10%) in the delayed phase. A type II curve is suspicious, although less strongly so than a type III curve. Type II curves have been reported to have a positive predictive value between 64–77%. 

• 
A type III (washout) curve has a >10% decrease in signal intensity in the delayed phase and is suspicious for malignancy. A type III curve has a positive predictive value of 87–92%, but is seen in only 21% of malignant lesions. False positive benign lesions that may show washout kinetics include lymph nodes, adenosis, and papillomas. 

• 
In the evaluation of a lesion, morphology is much more important than the pattern of enhancement. If a mass with malignant morphology (e.g., spiculated margins or rim enhancement) demonstrates type I enhancement, it remains just as suspicious for cancer. Similarly, a small, circumscribed, reniform mass adjacent to a vessel with type III kinetics is a typical appearance for a benign intramammary lymph node and should not be biopsied. 

• 
The main component of breast MRI is the dynamic post-contrast images with post-processing to evaluate for the morphology, and kinetics of any enhancing mass, focus, or NME. Initial evaluation of the post-processed CAD angiomap or MIP images can give a global overview of any abnormal enhancement. 

• 
T1-weighted images best show susceptibility artifact from biopsy clips or calcifications, and demonstrate hyperintense hemorrhagic cysts and proteinaceous ductal fluid. 

• 
T2-weighted images can be helpful to confirm benignity in a lesion that appears morphologically benign on the post-contrast images. Although no specific BI-RADS nomenclature exists to describe T2 characteristics, T2 hyperintensity within the enhancing portion of a mass is suggestive of a benign lesion. For instance, in younger women, myxoid fibroadenomas are typically hyperintense on T2-weighted images. 

• 
In isolation, T2 hyperintensity is not reliable for determining benignity. An important example is mucinous carcinoma, which is typically hyperintense on T2-weighted images. 



Contrast-enhanced MRI of a patient with biopsy-proven high-grade DCIS of the left breast: Post-processed color CAD angiomap shows extensive regional non-mass enhancement with suspicious enhancement kinetics (red and yellow colors). 


BI-RADS classification of masses or NME 
• Classification should be determined based on morphology and enhancement kinetics. Note that a lesion with malignant morphology is suspicious regardless of enhancement curve. 
• Mass or NME with a type I kinetic curve and benign morphology: BI-RADS 2: Bilateral scattered foci of enhancement, without a dominant mass or suspicious focal NME. BI-RADS 3: Mass or NME with benign morphology and enhancement kinetics, and negative targeted ultrasound. In order for follow-up to be appropriate (rather than biopsy), the lesion must demonstrate only benign features on MRI. It is specifically these benign MRI features, rather than the negative targeted ultrasound, that allow a lesion to be classified as BI-RADS 3. 
BI-RADS 4: Solitary, dominant, or asymmetric NME in a high-risk patient. 
• Mass or NME with type II or III kinetic curve and benign morphology: 
BI-RADS 4: A notable exception is a benign intramammary lymph node, which is typically located in the lateral breast adjacent to a vessel, and is reniform in shape. 
• 
Mass or NME with type I kinetics and malignant morphology is generally classified as BI­RADS 4. 

• 
A mass or NME with a type II–III kinetic curve and malignant morphology may be classified as BI-RADS 4 or 5.
