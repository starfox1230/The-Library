Approach to the symptomatic breast 
Breast pain 
• 
Breast pain is common and experienced by up to 80% of women in their lifetime. 

• 
Clinically significant breast pain is defined as focal and non-cyclical. 

• 
For women under age 30, initial evaluation of clinically significant breast pain should be with ultrasound. 

• 
For women aged 30 or older, initial evaluation of clinically significant breast pain can be performed with mammography or ultrasound. 

• 
Imaging is not appropriate for the initial evaluation of non-clinically significant breast pain (non-focal, cyclical). 

• 
MRI is never appropriate for the initial evaluation of breast pain. 


Pathologic nipple discharge 
• 
Pathologic nipple discharge is usually unilateral, spontaneous, and either serous, bloody, or clear. Causes include duct ectasia, intraductal papilloma, DCIS and invasive carcinoma. 

• 
By contrast, physiologic nipple discharge is usually bilateral, non-spontaneous and milky, green, or yellow in color. 

• 
For women under age 30, initial imaging evaluation of pathologic discharge should be with ultrasound. 

• 
For women aged 30 or older and all men, initial evaluation of pathologic discharge should be with mammography and ultrasound, although ultrasound alone can be considered in women between ages 30–39. 

• 
MRI is never appropriate for the initial evaluation of pathologic discharge but is increasingly utilized over galactography for further assessment of nipple discharge when mammography and ultrasound are negative. 

• 
Imaging is not appropriate for the initial evaluation of physiologic discharge. 


Palpable breast mass 
• 
In women aged 40 or older, initial evaluation of a palpable breast mass should be with mammography. For further characterization of corresponding mammographic findings that are not clearly benign and if mammography is negative, ultrasound of the palpable abnormality should also be performed. Any suspicious finding should be biopsied. 

• 
In women under age 30, initial evaluation should be performed with ultrasound. If ultrasound findings are suspicious, mammography should be considered for further workup and biopsy should be performed. If ultrasound is negative, mammography should be added if the clinical finding is striking; otherwise clinical follow-up is appropriate. For clearly benign or probably benign ultrasound findings in young women, further assessment with mammography is not necessary; ultrasound short interval follow-up or core biopsy should be performed for probably benign or low suspicion lesions. 

• 
In women between ages 30 and 39, initial evaluation can be performed with ultrasound or mammography. 

• 
In men under age 25, initial evaluation of an indeterminate breast mass (that is not classic for gynecomastia) should be with ultrasound. 

• 
In men aged 25 or older, or at any age with physical exam suspicious for breast cancer, both mammography and ultrasound are appropriate initial imaging options. 

• 
Benign appearing palpable breast cysts can be aspirated for symptomatic relief.
