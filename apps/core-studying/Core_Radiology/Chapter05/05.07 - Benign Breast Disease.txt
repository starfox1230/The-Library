Benign breast disease 
Cyclical and proliferative breast disease 
Fibrocystic change 
• 
Fibrocystic change is an essentially normal pattern of breast physiology. 

• 
Clinically, fibrocystic change presents as cyclical breast pain, sometimes with a palpable lump. Fibrocystic change is almost always seen in pre-menopausal women. 

• 
Imaging findings are not specific and the diagnosis of fibrocystic change is never made based on imaging alone. Its only significance is that it may cause certain imaging abnormalities that instigate further workup, such as cysts and calcifications. 


Sclerosing adenosis 
• 
Sclerosing adenosis is a benign proliferative lesion caused by lobular hyperplasia and formation of fibrous tissue that distorts the glandular elements. 

• 
Similar to fibrocystic change, the imaging importance of sclerosing adenosis is that it can mimic DCIS with microcalcifications. 




Infectious and inflammatory breast disease 
Mastitis 
• 
Mastitis is infection of the breast, most commonly by Staphylococcus aureus. It is typically seen in nursing mothers (called lactational or puerperal mastitis) or in diabetic patients. 

• 
Clinically, mastitis presents with breast pain, induration, and erythema. Treatment is antibiotics. If inadequately treated, mastitis can develop into a breast abscess. 

• 
Imaging is usually not performed, unless symptoms persist after antibiotics. Mammography and ultrasound can show focal or diffuse skin thickening, breast edema, and adenopathy. 

• 
The primary differential in this setting is inflammatory carcinoma. A skin punch biopsy can be performed if the two entities cannot be differentiated clinically or on imaging. 



Breast abscess 

Targeted ultrasound in a lactating patient who presented with breast pain, skin erythema, and 
palpable lump concerning for abscess. Image 
shows a heterogeneous collection containing low level internal echoes and layering debris, with surrounding inflammatory changes including overlying skin thickening. Cultures from subsequent aspiration grew S. auerus. 
• 
A breast abscess is a walled-off purulent collection, most commonly subareolar in location. Clinically, breast abscess presents with focal breast pain, erythema, fluctuance, and fever. 

• 
On mammography, breast abscess can appear as a mass, asymmetry, or architectural distortion, with overlying skin thickening. 

• 
Ultrasound often shows an oval or irregular mass with complex cystic and solid echotexture, indistinct margins and an echogenic halo. The periphery of the mass is often hypervascular. 

• 
Treatment is ultrasound-guided aspiration in addition to antibiotics.

Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis 
• 
Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis is a rare cause of breast inflammation that is more common in young reproductive age women who have previously lactated. Hormonal influences are felt to likely contribute. Although no infectious etiology is identified in many cases, a certain subset is felt to be due to indolent infection with Corynebacterium species. 

• 
Granulomatous mastitis usually presents as one or more painful palpable breast masses. There may be associated skin erythema or nipple discharge. 

• 
Mammography most often shows focal asymmetry or an irregular mass. 

• 
On ultrasound there is usually an irregular mass or confluent masses with parallel orientation and hypoechoic or heterogeneous echotexture. In longstanding cases, fluid collections may be present. 

• 
Granulomatous mastitis shows enhancement on MRI and may present as segmental distribution NME. 

• 
The imaging features of granulomatous mastitis may mimic breast cancer and biopsy is usually warranted. Treatment of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis can be challenging, and symptoms may be longstanding. 



Periductal mastitis 
• Periductal mastitis, also known as plasma cell mastitis, is caused by the irritating contents of intraductal lipids. It is seen in post-menopausal women and produces the classic mammographic appearance of large, rod-like secretory calcifications. 
Diabetic mastopathy 

Targeted ultrasound of bilateral breasts in a patient with type 1 diabetes who presented with palpable bilateral subareolar masses. Images show irregular hypoechoic masses with posterior shadowing in the bilateral subareolar regions. Given similar appearances and patient history, these masses may represent diabetic mastopathy, however malignancy must be excluded. Patient underwent core needle biopsy of the right breast mass which confirmed diabetic mastopathy. 
• Diabetic mastopathy is a sequela of long-term insulin-dependent diabetes. An autoimmune reaction to matrix proteins from chronic hyperglycemia causes a firm and sometimes painful mass. 
• 
On mammography, diabetic mastopathy can appear as an ill-defined, asymmetric density without microcalcifications or as architectural distortion. 

• 
Ultrasound typically shows a hypoechoic mass or regional acoustic shadowing, mimicking the appearance of a scirrhous breast cancer. 

• 
Because the mammographic and sonographic appearance can mimic breast cancer, core biopsy is required.

Mondor disease 

Ultrasound image with color Doppler shows a tubular hypoechoic mass without internal vascularity, likely a thrombosed superficial vessel. 
• 
Mondor disease is thrombophlebitis of a superficial vein of the breast, most commonly the thoracoepigastric vein. 

• 
Clinically, Mondor disease presents with pain and tenderness in the region of the thrombosed vein. A cordlike, elongated superficial mass may be present. 

• 
Ultrasound shows a dilated, “bead-like” tubular structure with no flow on color Doppler.
