Breast interventions 
Overview of breast interventions 
• Regardless of the method of biopsy, the radiologist must perform a radiology-pathology correlation of every case to ensure that the pathologic diagnosis is concordant with the imaging findings. Discordant findings should receive further workup, typically requiring repeat biopsy, either core or excisional. An example of a discordant finding is benign pathology (e.g., fragments of a fibroadenoma) for a highly suspicious, spiculated mass. 

Percutaneous needle biopsy 
Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy 


Pre-procedure ultrasound demonstrates a shadowing, spiculated mass (calipers) with taller-than-wide orientation that is highly suspicious. 

• 
Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy is the preferred approach for a lesion that is well seen on ultrasound. Ultrasound-guided biopsy using standard freehand technique and a 14-gauge spring-loaded needle is a highly accurate method to biopsy breast masses. 

• 
Ultrasound-guided interventions are the most user-dependent and take time to master. Appropriate initial positioning of the patient and planning of the approach allows a smooth procedure. Some practitioners always hold the ultrasound probe in the non-dominant hand to allow the dominant hand control over the needle. Others take an ambidextrous approach. 

• 
A lateral approach to the lesion is generally preferred. It is critical when performing an ultrasound-guided procedure to always keep the biopsy device parallel to the chest wall, or at a very shallow angle of obliquity. A standard breast biopsy needle advances approximately 2 cm when sampling. Far posterior lesions can be entered with the tip of the biopsy device and lifted anteriorly off the chest wall before sampling. 

• Posterior lesions require a larger distance between the lesion and the entry site to maintain a nearly parallel biopsy needle course. Once an entry site is chosen, cutaneous and subcutaneous anesthesia is administered under ultrasound guidance and a small skin incision is made. Each needle pass should be documented and needle positioning within the target demonstrated in an orthogonal plane for at least 1–2 passes. 

• 
After adequate sampling, a tissue marker is typically placed, and post-procedure mammography is performed to confirm marker position within the targeted lesion. 

• 
The technique for ultrasound-guided cyst aspiration is similar to that of a core needle biopsy. Instead of employing a spring-loaded biopsy gun, a standard syringe is attached to a 20- or 18-gauge needle and the targeted cyst is aspirated. 

• 
The cyst aspirate should be sent for cytology if bloody or clear. Benign-appearing aspirate, which may be green, grey, yellow, or cloudy, may be discarded. Note that only benign-appearing cysts should be aspirated. A complex cystic and solid mass should be biopsied with a core device (with the solid component targeted). 


Mammographic-guided stereotactic core biopsy 


Stereotactic biopsy of calcifications: 
Paired 15° oblique pre-fire images (top images) show the targeted calcifications (arrows) with appropriate position of the biopsy device. 
Specimen radiograph confirms that the targeted calcifications are present within the specimen (arrow). 

• 
Stereotactic guidance using 2D mammography is used most commonly to biopsy calcifications. Less commonly, a stereotactic approach can be used to sample a mammographic finding seen only in one view or a mammographic mass or architectural distortion not seen on ultrasound. 

• 
Stereotactic biopsy tables can be prone or seated upright. The advantage of a prone table is elimination of risk from vasovagal syncope. The seated stereotactic apparatus is less expensive and may offer greater patient comfort. The breast is immobilized in compression during the entire procedure. 

• 
Contraindications to stereotactic biopsy include a thin breast measuring <3 cm compressed (although petite needles are available to sample lesions in breasts as thin as 22 mm), far posterior or subareolar location, inability to be positioned on the stereotactic table, and uncontrolled coagulation abnormality. 

• 
Paired stereo spot views of the target are obtained 15° to each side (30° apart) relative to the needle path. Once targeting is confirmed by the radiologist, the actual needle path in three-dimensional space is calculated by computer. 

• 
Adequate local anesthesia is administered to the dermis and along the expected path of the biopsy needle (without imaging guidance) and a small skin incision is sometimes made at the biopsy needle entrance site (biopsy needles typically have extremely sharp tips and can be directly advanced through the skin). 

• 
A vacuum-assisted biopsy needle (7- to 12-gauge options are available) is employed, and appropriate positioning is confirmed on the horizontal (x), vertical (y), and depth (z) axes. After the samples are obtained, the specimen must be radiographed to confirm that the targeted calcifications are present. 

• 
Once the presence of calcification is confirmed in the sample, a marker clip is placed, and post-procedure two-view mammograms are obtained to confirm clip position. Often, small calcifications will be completely removed by the vacuum-assisted biopsy and correct position of the clip is essential if the lesion requires subsequent surgical treatment. 


Tomosynthesis-guided stereotactic core biopsy 
• 
Compared to traditional 2D mammography-guided stereotactic biopsy, tomosynthesis­guided core biopsy has the advantages of easier user operation, faster targeting given no need for the paired 15° stereo views, and facilitates the biopsy of asymmetries, focal asymmetries, or architectural distortions. 

• 
One disadvantage is that subtle calcifications may be difficult to visualize on tomosynthesis images, which may necessitate conversion to a 2D mammography-guided stereotactic biopsy. 

• 
Apart from the elimination of the paired stereo views, tomosynthesis-guided core biopsy follows similar steps to its 2D mammographic counterpart. 


MRI-guided biopsy 

MR images obtained during an MRI-guided biopsy. Post-contrast image through the mid breast (left image) shows the targeted abnormal enhancement (arrows). The lesion is not very conspicuous because the patient had to be repositioned and delayed parenchymal enhancement partially obscures the lesion. The image on the right shows the grid applied to the lateral breast, and the star marks the position of the targeted lesion on the grid. Note that despite the sagittal orientation of these images, the patient is positioned prone. 
• MRI-guided biopsy can be performed for lesions seen only on MRI. Given that MRI-guided biopsy is expensive and can be more uncomfortable for the patient, it is common to perform a second-look ultrasound targeted towards the MRI abnormality so that ultrasound-guided biopsy might be an option. A corresponding ultrasound finding is identified in 56–57% of cases, with masses and larger lesions being more likely to have a correlate than non-mass 
enhancement and smaller lesions. 

• MRI-guided biopsy almost always requires intravenous gadolinium. Time is of the essence during the procedure because the lesion must be targeted before contrast washes out or the 
lesion becomes obscured by delayed parenchymal enhancement. 
• 
The grid-coordinate method allows accurate biopsy of an abnormality seen only on MRI. This method is most analogous to a grid-based CT-guided biopsy elsewhere in the body. 

• 
With the patient lying prone, a grid is applied to either the medial or lateral breast. A lateral approach is preferred whenever possible as it allows greater access to posterior tissues. After initial images are obtained, the targeted lesion is localized on the grid. Local anesthesia is administered without imaging guidance. During the biopsy, the core needle device is inserted exactly perpendicular to the breast to a pre-measured depth, similar to stereotactic biopsy. Multiple 9- to 11-gauge vacuum-assisted samples are obtained. Finally, a post-biopsy marker is deployed. 



Pre-operative lesion localization 
Radioactive seed localization 
• 
Prior to excisional biopsy or lumpectomy, pre-operative localization of a breast lesion can be performed using an iodine-125 radioactive seed. Under either mammographic or ultrasound guidance, the seed is placed within or next to the targeted lesion. Its position is confirmed by orthogonal mammographic images. In the operating room, the surgeon uses a gamma probe to detect the radioactivity prior to excision. 

• 
Radioactive seeds are increasingly utilized due to certain advantages over wire localization. 


Unlike wire localization which is restricted to the day of surgery, radioactive seed can be placed up to 5 days before surgery. There is more flexibility in approach for placement by the radiologist and choice for incision location by 
the surgeon, allowing potentially better cosmesis. Lack of external wires outside the skin surface leads to higher patient satisfaction, and less risk for wire migration or dislodgement. 
• The main drawback of radioactive seeds is implementing the many safety requirements for their use. Additionally, if a seed is inaccurately positioned, it cannot be removed prior to surgery; a second seed must be placed to localize the targeted lesion, with both seeds removed during surgery. Radioseeds cannot currently be placed under MRI guidance as the pre-loaded radioseed needles and gamma probes used to check for deployment are not MRI compatible. 

Wire localization 
• 
Another option for pre-operative marking of a breast lesion is wire localization. The wire can be placed under mammographic, sonographic or MRI guidance (if an MRI compatible system is used). 

• 
The shortest approach to the lesion should be used and an appropriate wire length should 


be chosen (typically 5, 7, or 9 cm). 

• After the lumpectomy or excisional biopsy, specimen radiographs are obtained to confirm that the targeted lesion and the intact hook wire are contained within the specimen. 

Step 2: After local anesthesia, the needle is inserted into the skin entry site based on the grid and advanced towards the target. Ideally the needle shaft should be exactly in-line with the x-ray beam. 




Other localization modalities 
• Non-magnetic radioactive radar localization and magnetic seed localization are additional newer methods used for pre-operative localization. 
Bracketing method 
• When targeting a large area of breast tissue, two or more wires or seeds can be placed, to delineate the boundaries of the target. The surgeon can then remove the tissue in between and around the bracketing wires or seeds, to ensure excision of the targeted lesion in its entirety.
