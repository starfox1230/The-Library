• 
Imaging shows enlargement, thrombosis, and mural enhancement of the affected veins. 

• 
Pulmonary septic emboli may be present. 


Tuberculous adenitis (scrofula) 
• Tuberculous adenitis is usually seen in patients of Asian descent who present with painless neck masses. Imaging findings are classically bilateral necrotic lymph nodes, often in the level V posterior triangle distribution, occasionally multiloculated with ring-like 
enhancement. Sinus tracts to skin can form at the late stage. The nodes classically calcify 
after treatment. 
Cat scratch fever 
• Cat scratch fever is an infection caused by Bartonella henselae and can present with fever, malaise, and regional lymphadenopathy. It can be self-limited or can progress to 
encephalopathy and neuropathy. 

Thyroid and parathyroid 
Diffuse thyroid disease 
Hashimoto thyroiditis (chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis) 
• 
Hashimoto thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease that is thought to be due to autoantibodies to thyroglobulins. It is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. 

• 
The diagnosis is often made serologically. Patients are often euthyroid early in disease, but eventually become hypothyroid due to replacement of functioning thyroid parenchyma. 

• 
Ultrasound may show either a diffusely micronodular gland or a heterogeneous coarsened gland without a measurable nodule. The isthmus is characteristically thickened. In its end stage, the gland becomes atrophic. 

• 
Patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis are at increased risk of thyroid lymphoma. 


Graves disease

• 
Graves disease causes autoimmune activation of the TSH receptor, stimulating thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion. Patients clinically present with thyrotoxicosis. 

• 
Ultrasound may show diffuse enlargement of the gland, a coarsened echotexture and hypervascularity. The borders of the gland are often lobulated. 

• 
The key color Doppler finding is the thyroid inferno sign, which represents marked hypervascularity caused by arteriovenous shunting and enlarged peripheral vessels. 

• 
Because of significant overlap in sonographic findings with Hashimoto thyroiditis, correlation with laboratory findings is required. 


Subacute thyroiditis (de Quervain thyroiditis)

• Subacute (de Quervain) thyroiditis is granulomatous inflammation of the thyroid, thought to be viral in origin. It is the most common cause of a painful thyroid mass. The gland is usually 
tender and adjacent cervical adenopathy is common. 
• Patients may present with transient hyperthyroidism due to follicular rupture and release of thyroid hormones, followed by hypothyroidism after depletion of hormone stores. It is 
usually diagnosed clinically. 
• 
Ultrasound findings include ill-defined, patchy areas of decreased echogenicity in the involved regions. Vascularity is normal or decreased. 

• 
Subacute thyroiditis is treated with steroids. Follow-up ultrasound appearance can show a dramatic response to treatment. 


Multinodular gland 
• 
The term multinodular gland is preferred over multinodular goiter because goiter is a generic term for an enlarged gland, which can have numerous causes. 

• 
On imaging, a multinodular gland will appear enlarged with innumerable mixed cystic and solid nodules. 




Thyroid nodule and thyroid cancer 
Approach to a thyroid nodule 
• 
There are no definitive ultrasound features that distinguish benign from malignant nodules. 

• 
The American Thyroid Association (ATA) has developed guidelines for assessment of thyroid nodules on ultrasound. These guidelines stress use of the sonographic pattern and size for risk stratification and subsequent decision-making regarding FNA. 

• 
High-suspicion sonographic features include: microcalcifications, hypoechogenicity with irregular margins, taller-than-wide shape. 

• 
Intermediate suspicion sonographic features include hypoechogenicity with regular margins. 

• 
Low and very-low suspicion sonographic features include hyperechoic or isoechoic solid nodules with regular margins, spongiform echotexture, partially cystic nodules with 


eccentric solid mass. 
• The American College of Radiology white papers have published guidelines on management of incidental thyroid nodules detected on CT or MRI. In the absence of suspicious features on CT or MRI, a thyroid ultrasound is recommended when nodules =1 cm in patients <35 years old, and when nodules >1.5 cm in patients >35 years old. Nodules that do not meet size criteria do not require further evaluation. 
Thyroid cancer 

Thyroid carcinoma: Sagittal (left image) and transverse grayscale images through the left lobe of the thyroid demonstrate a solid nodule (calipers) with irregular borders containing punctate calcifications (arrows). 
Case courtesy Julie Ritner, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• Papillary cancer is by far the most common histologic subtype of thyroid cancer, and confers the best prognosis. Lymphangitic spread is common, and therefore cervical, sometimes cystic, lymphadenopathy is common. Lymph nodes may also be calcified, colloid-containing, or vascular. 
• 
Follicular carcinomas tend to spread hematogenously and have the next best prognosis.  

• 
Medullary subtypes are less common and more aggressive and are associated with MEN II syndrome. The anaplastic subtype is very rare and has the worst prognosis. 

• 
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can also occur in the thyroid and usually presents as a solid nodule. 




Parathyroid 
Anatomy 
• 
Parathyroid glands are usually found adjacent to the thyroid gland. Most patients have four glands, but there may be between two and six. 

• 
Ectopic locations of the parathyroid glands include the upper mediastinum, in the tracheoesophageal groove, or at the thoracic inlet. 


Indications for imaging 
• 
The most frequent indication for parathyroid imaging is workup of hypercalcemia for identification of a parathyroid adenoma and/or hyperplasia. 

• 
Patients frequently go straight to curative surgical exploration. In this population, up to  10% of patients develop persistent or recurrent disease after initial surgery. Therefore, parathyroid localization is more frequently indicated in the re-operative setting. 

• 
MEN I is associated with parathyroid adenomas or hyperplasia. 

• 
Malignant neoplasms of the parathyroid (parathyroid carcinoma) are rare and distinction can be made with benign adenomas based on rapid growth, local aggressive behavior, and 


presence of lymph node metastases. 
• 
Imaging options include ultrasound, four-dimensional (4D) CT, or PET. 

• 
Ultrasound is usually the first-line modality. Parathyroid adenomas appear round, well-circumscribed, homogeneous, and hypoechoic relative to thyroid tissue. Pros of using ultrasound are the low-cost and lack of radiation. Limitations include operator dependence, insensitivity for detection of multigland parathyroid disease, and the inability to localize parathyroid tissue in sonographically inaccessible locations, such as the mediastinum, tracheoesophageal groove, retroesophageal or retroclavicular locations. 

• 
4DCT consists of performing noncontrast, arterial, and delayed phases to capitalize on the perfusion kinetics of adenomas. Parathyroid adenomas classically are hypodense in comparison to normal thyroid tissue on noncontrast, 


demonstrate enhancement greater than thyroid on early (35 sec) arterial phase, and washout more than thyroid in the delayed phase. However, less than half of parathyroid adenomas follow this pattern. Large adenomas may show heterogeneous enhancement and atypical enhancement patterns. 

Classic parathyroid adenoma: 
Axial 4DCT shows a mass (arrows) posterior to the left thyroid lobe in the left paraesophageal region  
which is hypodense to thyroid 
on noncontrast phase, hyper-
enhancing compared to thyroid on arterial phase. 
Noncontrast CT Arterial phase CT 

Noncontrast CT Arterial phase CT Delayed phase CT Atypical parathyroid adenoma: Axial 4DCT shows an oval nodule (arrows) posterior to the right thyroid lobe 
which is hypodense to thyroid on noncontrast phase as well as arterial phase, and isodense to thyroid on delay 
phase. This biopsy-proven parathyroid adenoma does not follow the classical enhancement pattern but is otherwise typical in appearance with regards to morphology and location. 
• 
Greatest advantage of 4DCT is for localization of small, multinodular, and/or ectopic adenomas including those located far-posterior to thyroid (paraesophageal). However, the greatest limitation is the high radiation exposure. 

• 
Tc-99m sestamibi is the PET tracer that is taken up by parathyroids, and is discussed in greater detail within the “Nuclear Imaging” chapter. 

• 
MRI is occasionally used as second-line modality to identify lesions that have been otherwise poorly localized by prior studies.
