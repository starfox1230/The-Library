Overview of the sinonasal tract and anterior skull base 
Sinonasal histology and development 
• 
The nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses are lined with Schneiderian epithelium, a ciliated mucosa of ectodermal origin that propels contents along anatomic drainage pathways toward the nasopharynx. 

• 
The sinuses develop at different times in children. At birth, the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses are present but hypoplastic. Only later does the sphenoid pneumatize, followed by the  frontal sinuses.

Sinonasal and anterior skull base anatomy (continued) 
• The superior, middle, and inferior nasal turbinates/conchae are three paired bony protuberances within the nasal cavity that form air passages inferior to each, called the 
superior, middle, and inferior meatuses. 
• 
The inferior meatus is the drainage site of the nasolacrimal duct. 

• 
The ostiomeatal complex (OMC) or unit is the common pathway for the maxillary, frontal, 


and anterior ethmoid sinuses to drain into the middle meatus. The OMC is a functional unit comprising the maxillary sinus ostium, ethmoid infundibulum, uncinate process, ethmoid bulla, hiatus semilunaris, and middle meatus. 
• 
The frontal sinus drains via the frontal recess either into the ethmoid infundibulum or directly into the middle meatus. Some authors include the frontal recess in the OMC. 

• 
The maxillary sinus is the largest sinus and drains via the maxillary sinus ostium and infundibulum, which if obstructed can cause isolated maxillary sinus disease. 

• 
The ethmoid sinuses or air cells are divided into anterior and posterior air cells by the basal 


lamella of the middle turbinate where it attaches to the lamina papyracea. The lamina papyracea is the thin part of the ethmoid bone separating the ethmoid air cells from the orbit. The ethmoid labyrinth is covered superiorly by the fovea ethmoidalis, an extension of the orbital part of 
the frontal bone. Between the orbital plates on either side are the cribriform plates, the horizontal portion of the ethmoid bone that lies lower than the fovea ethmoidalis and supports the olfactory bulbs. 
• 
The sphenoethmoidal recess is the common pathway for the sphenoid sinus and posterior ethmoid air cells to drain into the superior meatus. 

• 
The anterior skull base, which separates the anterior cranial fossa from the sinonasal tract and orbits, is comprised of the orbital parts of the frontal bone, cribriform plates of the ethmoid bone, and planum sphenoidale and lesser wings of the sphenoid bone. 



Sinonasal anatomic variants 
• The variable depth of the olfactory fossa, which is bounded by the vertical and horizontal lamella of the cribriform plate, is important due to the risk of penetration at this site during 
endoscopic sinus surgery. 
• The agger nasi cell is an anteriormost ethmoid air cell located anterior to the frontal recess. 
A large agger nasi cell may narrow the frontal recess. 
• 
A supraorbital cell is an anterior ethmoid cell that extends superior to the orbit and anterior ethmoidal notch, which carries the anterior ethmoid artery. The presence of supraorbital pneumatization places the artery at greater intraoperative risk. 

• 
A Haller (infraorbital) cell is an ethmoid air cell located along the medial orbital floor, which may narrow the maxillary ostium if large or inflamed.

Sinonasal anatomic variants (continued) 
• An Onodi (sphenoethmoidal) cell is a posteriormost ethmoid air cell that extends superior and lateral to the sphenoid sinus. An Onodi cell should be recognized to avoid intraoperative damage to the adjacent optic nerve.

• Additional anatomic variants that are usually asymptomatic but can contribute to sinonasal obstruction if large include nasal septal deviation, concha bullosa (pneumatized middle turbinate), and paradoxical (inward) curvature of the middle turbinate. 
Imaging of the sinuses 
• 
CT is the primary modality for imaging the bony detail of the sinuses. 

• 
Imaging is usually not appropriate for acute uncomplicated rhinosinusitis but is indicated for suspected orbital or intracranial complications of acute rhinosinusitis, suspected acute invasive fungal sinusitis, surgical planning for chronic or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, or 


suspected sinonasal mass. 
• 
MRI is useful for its soft tissue contrast in evaluating suspected orbital or intracranial complications of sinusitis or a sinonasal mass. While both may appear as sinus opacification on CT,  contrast enhancement on MRI clearly distinguishes mucosal lesions from obstructed secretions. 

• 
MRI of routine sinus disease is unreliable due to the varying signal intensities of sinus contents: inspissated secretions that are clearly opacified sinus on CT can have low signal that could be mistaken for normal aeration on MRI. 

• 
The purpose of preoperative sinus CT is to identify anatomic variations (noted above) that may lead to surgical complications if the surgeon is unaware and to provide intraoperative navigation. 

• 
Thinning or bony dehiscence (absence of bone) due to prior injury or chronic inflammation should be identified, particularly at the cribriform plate (risk of entry into the anterior cranial fossa), lamina papyracea (orbit), and sphenoid sinus walls (carotid canal and optic nerve). 




Inflammatory sinonasal disease 
Rhinosinusitis 
• 
Rhinosinusitis is inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal mucosa. It is a clinical diagnosis (based on symptoms such as purulent nasal drainage, nasal obstruction, facial pressure, and hyposmia), with imaging reserved for suspected complications, surgical planning, or suspected obstructing mass. 

• 
Acute rhinosinusitis lasts <4 weeks. The most common cause is viral, followed by bacterial infection. See below for separate discussion of fungal disease. 

• 
Chronic rhinosinusitis lasts =12 consecutive weeks. Chronic sinusitis is probably related to obstruction of sinonasal drainage pathways. The goal of functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is to open/widen these pathways. 

• 
Systemic risk factors for rhinosinusitis include: 


Mucociliary clearance defects: e.g., cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia. Immunodeficiencies: e.g., common variable immune deficiency, hypogammaglobulinemia. Small vessel vasculitides: granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) especially when there is bony 
erosion and septal perforation, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss) 
especially when there is nasal polyposis. 
• Odontogenic sinusitis is the most common cause of unilateral/isolated maxillary sinusitis. The usual etiologies are a maxillary premolar or molar tooth with periapical abscess or, after extraction, an oroantral fistula. 

Coronal CT shows opacification of the bilateral maxillary sinuses, 
thought to present odontogenic 
sinusitis, at least on the left. Note dental caries (yellow arrow) involving a left upper maxillary tooth and associated periapical lucency (red arrow) representing a periapical abscess or granuloma. 
• Sinus mucosal thickening is a common but nonspecific imaging finding. Acute sinusitis is more likely to feature an air-fluid level and bubbles within the fluid. Sclerotic thickening of sinus walls, due to prolonged mucoperiosteal inflammation, is characteristic of chronic sinusitis. 
Fungal rhinosinusitis 

Allergic fungal sinusitis: Coronal (left image) and axial noncontrast CT shows marked pan-sinus disease with curvilinear hyperattenuation in the affected sinuses (arrows). There is erosion of the ethmoid sinus walls.

• 
Fungal sinus diseases are classified as noninvasive or invasive, based on extension to the submucosa, vessels, and/or bone. 

• 
Noninvasive fungal rhinosinusitis includes allergic fungal rhinosinusitis and fungal ball. Affected patients are immunocompetent. 

• 
Invasive fungal rhinosinusitis is divided into acute and chronic forms. The vast majority of affected patients have diabetes mellitus or are immunocompromised (e.g., hematologic malignancy, chemotherapy-related neutropenia, transplantation). 

• 
Noninvasive and chronic invasive fungal rhinosinusitis are most commonly due to Aspergillus and dematiaceous (brown-black) molds. Acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis is most commonly caused by aspergillosis or mucormycosis. 

• 
Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis is the most common form of fungal sinusitis, representing a subtype/variant of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis caused by a localized hypersensitivity reaction to fungi, typically in atopic individuals. 


Imaging shows complete opacification of multiple sinuses with secretions that are hyperattenuating (CT) and low T2 signal intensity (MRI) and cause expansile remodeling/pressure erosion of the sinus walls. 
• Fungus balls are dense aggregates of (noninvasive) hyphae and (nonallergic) mucin separate 
from the sinus mucosa. 
Imaging shows opacification of a single sinus (usually maxillary) with an irregular mass that is hyperattenuating (CT) and low T2 signal intensity (MRI), often with intralesional mineralization/ calcification. There may be bony erosion. 
• Invasive fungal rhinosinusitis is a serious acute or chronic infection where fungal hyphae invade mucosa, vessels, and/or other sinonasal tissues and cause necrosis. The most common but nonspecific imaging finding of invasive fungal rhinosinusitis is severe unilateral sinonasal opacification. Later in the disease course, more specific imaging signs include extrasinus soft tissue infiltration into the 
premaxillary and retroantral fat, intracranial or orbital involvement, and bony erosion. Non-enhancement of a nasal turbinate on MRI (black turbinate sign) in an immunocompromised patient is highly suggestive of necrosis in the setting of invasive fungal rhinosinusitis. 
Complications of rhinosinusitis 

Acute frontal sinusitis complicated by epidural and subdural empyemas: Axial post-contrast T1-weighted MRI (left image) demonstrates left frontal epidural (yellow arrow) and subdural (red arrows) collections with rim enhancement and associated restricted diffusion on DWI (right image), consistent with empyemas. There is diffuse left frontal scalp subcutaneous edema representing cellulitis. 
• 
Spread of infection to the orbit may cause preseptal or orbital cellulitis, orbital abscess, subperiosteal abscess, or septic ophthalmic vein and cavernous sinus thrombosis. 

• 
Spread of infection to the cranial cavity may cause meningitis, cerebritis, or suppurative collections (epidural abscess, subdural empyema, or brain abscess). The frontal lobe is the typical site of sinogenic brain abscess. 

• 
Acute frontal sinusitis complicated by osteomyelitis and subgaleal/subperiosteal abscess is known as Pott's puffy tumor. 



Acute frontal sinusitis complicated by Pott's puffy tumor: Axial contrast-enhanced CT shows opacified frontal sinuses and focal defect in the anterior sinus wall (green arrow) with overlying soft tissue swelling and a gas-fluid collection (red arrows) in the frontal scalp, compatible with abscess (Pott's puffy tumor). 
Sinonasal inflammatory polyps 
• Sinonasal inflammatory polyps and nasal polyposis refer to multiple bilateral pedunculated protrusions of mucosa, edematous stroma, and inflammatory infiltrate, most commonly 
arising from the middle meatus and ethmoid region. 
• 
In adults, a significant minority of cases of chronic rhinosinusitis are associated with nasal polyposis, which together in turn is sometimes associated with asthma and sensitivity to aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This syndrome is known as aspirin/ NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease or Samter’s triad. 

• 
In children, the most common risk factor for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis is cystic fibrosis. 



Paranasal sinus retention cyst 
• 
Retention cysts are well-defined, rounded collections of mucous or serous fluid arising in the sinus lining due to obstruction of small seromucinous glands. “Mucous retention cyst” is often used generically to include both mucous and serous retention cysts. 

• 
Retention cysts are usually asymptomatic but can obstruct sinus drainage pathways. They are most commonly located in the maxillary sinus. 



Mucocele 

Mucocele of the frontal sinus: 
Axial noncontrast CT shows an expanded, fluid-filled right frontal sinus (arrow) with thinning of the sinus walls. Incidentally, the left frontal sinus is congenitally absent.

Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. 
• 
A mucocele is an expanded, airless paranasal sinus filled with mucoid secretions due to drainage obstruction. 

• 
Mucoceles may be secondary to inflammatory sinus disease (most commonly) or tumor. 

• 
Imaging shows complete opacification of a single sinus cavity with expansile remodeling and thinning of the bony walls. The sinus contents tend to appear homogeneous on CT and MR; however, the MR signal intensity is variable depending on the degree of dessication. 

• 
Mucoceles are most common in the frontal sinus. 



Silent sinus syndrome 
• 
Silent sinus syndrome is an acquired condition of painless maxillary sinus atelectasis due to chronic obstruction of the maxillary sinus ostium with resorption of the air. 

• 
Imaging and physical examination show facial asymmetry due to unilateral maxillary sinus volume loss, complete or partial opacification of the sinus, and enophthalmos. 


Nasal septal perforation 
• 
Nasal septal perforation usually involves the cartilaginous septum and is generally related to ischemia or inflammation. 

• 
The most common cause is iatrogenic/traumatic (e.g., septoplasty). Other causes include cocaine, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s), and granulomatous infections. 




Benign non-inflammatory sinonasal and anterior skull base lesions 
Choanal polyp 

Antrochoanal polyp: Coronal (left image) and axial noncontrast CT show a polypoid lesion (arrows) involving the left maxillary sinus and nasopharynx, with erosion of the middle turbinate and medial wall of the maxillary 
sinus. 
Case courtesy Mary Beth Cunnane, MD, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. 
• 
Choanal polyps are solitary pedunculated lesions that extend through the nasal cavity to the posterior nasal aperture (choana), possibly prolapsing into the nasopharynx. 

• 
The vast majority are antrochoanal polyps, which originate in the maxillary sinus (antrum) and widen the maxillary ostia. 

• 
Choanal polyps are histologically similar to inflammatory polyps but considered clinically distinct. They mostly occur in children and young adults. 


Sinonasal papilloma 

Inverted papilloma: Axial noncontrast CT shows Inverted papilloma in a different patient: Axial a polypoid lesion of the left maxillary sinus with contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI with fat erosion of the medial wall of the maxillary sinus, the suppression shows a lobulated extra-axial mass ethmoid air cells, and the turbinates.

• 
Sinonasal (Schneiderian) papillomas are benign polypoid neoplasms arising from the Schneiderian epithelium. 

• 
The most common histologic type of sinonasal papilloma is the inverted type, followed by exophytic and oncocytic types. 


Sinonasal papilloma (continued) 
• 
Inverted and oncocytic papillomas have malignant potential, typically transforming to squamous cell carcinoma, while exophytic papillomas do not. 

• 
Inverted and oncocytic papillomas typically arise from paranasal sinuses or the lateral nasal wall, while exophytic papillomas tend to arise from the nasal septum. 

• 
Inverted papillomas classically show a convoluted cerebriform pattern on T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR images (alternating curvilinear bands of high and low signal intensity). At CT, bone erosion and remodeling are common, although the site of attachment may demonstrate focal hyperostosis. 


Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) 

Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma: Axial contrast-enhanced CT through the pterygopalatine fossa in soft tissue (left image) and bone windows shows an avidly enhancing mass in the left nasopharynx, pterygopalatine fossa, and sphenoid sinus, with characteristic widening (arrows) of the pterygopalatine fossa. There is resultant anterior displacement of the posterior wall of the maxillary sinus relative to the left (dotted blue line). 
Case courtesy Sanjay Prabhu, MD, Boston Children’s Hospital. 
• Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is the most common benign neoplasm of the nasopharynx and typically arises from the posterior aspect of the nasal cavity near the sphenopalatine foramen. 
• 
While benign, JNA may be locally aggressive and, due to its vascularity, presents a risk for life-threatening bleeding. 

• 
JNA almost always affects adolescent/young adult males, who present with epistaxis and/or nasal obstruction. 

• 
On imaging, JNA shows intense contrast enhancement with a salt-and-pepper appearance on MRI due to vascular flow voids. The mass can extend into the pterygopalatine fossa, expanding it and anteriorly bowing the posterior maxillary sinus wall (Holman-Miller/antral sign). 

• 
The most common arterial supply of JNA consists of distal internal maxillary artery branches. Embolization is often performed to reduce lesion vascularity prior to resection. 



Congenital nasal masses 
• The most common pediatric midline nasal masses are anomalies of neuroectodermal 
development at the frontonasal region including, in decreasing frequency, dermoid/ 
epidermoid cyst, encephalocele, and nasal glial heterotopia. 
• Nasal dermoid/epidermoid cysts, usually associated with dermal sinus tracts, are ectodermal inclusions that appear as a round cyst along the anterior nose from the tip up to the crista galli. Dermoid cysts may have fat density/signal, while epidermoid cysts show restricted diffusion. 

Nasal dermoids: Sagittal T2-weighted MRI (left image) demonstrates a well-defined midline nasal lesion (arrow) associated with a widened foramen cecum. Axial CT of a different patient (right image) shows a similarly located lesion with internal fat density (arrow). 
• Frontoethmoidal encephaloceles, also known as anterior or sincipital cephaloceles, refer to herniations of meninges, CSF, and/or brain tissue through an anterior skull or skull base defect. The protrusion can be located at the glabella (via the fonticulus nasofrontalis), nasal cavity (via the foramen cecum), or medial orbit (via the lacrimal bone). MRI best demonstrates the soft tissue mass contiguous with intracranial contents. 

Encephalocele: Axial T2-weighted MRI shows focal herniation of brain tissue through a small defect in the left frontal calvarium (arrow). 
• Nasal glial heterotopias, also known as nasal gliomas, are non-neoplastic masses of dysplastic neuroglial tissue isolated to the nasal dorsum or nasal cavity. MRI shows a soft tissue mass without connection to intracranial contents. 

Nasal glioma: 
Sagittal T1-weighted post-contrast MRI demonstrates a non-enhancing, multilobulated lesion at the dorsum of the nose (arrows) without communication with the intracranial compartment. This was a biopsy-proven nasal glioma. 

Fibro-osseous lesions 
• 
Fibro-osseous lesions in the craniofacial skeleton are a spectrum of pathologic ossifications with variable amounts of fibroblastic stroma. While benign, they can cause symptoms related to mass effect or facial deformity. 

• 
Osteomas are the most common neoplasm in the paranasal sinuses, occurring as a polypoid 


growth most frequently within the frontal sinus followed by ethmoid air cells. They are mostly made of dense bone. Gardner syndrome is the association of familial adenomatous polyposis with multiple skull osteomas and soft tissue tumors such as desmoid. 
• Craniofacial fibrous dysplasia is one of the most common sites of fibrous dysplasia (along with femur, tibia, and ribs), wherein bone is replaced with disorganized fibrous tissue. CT shows ill-defined regions of bony expansion with radiolucent ground glass, sclerotic, or mixed density. MRI variably shows heterogeneous signal intensity and contrast 
enhancement. 

Fibrous dysplasia: Axial CT through the face shows a well-circumscribed, expansile osseous lesion with ground glass matrix in 
the right maxilla. 
The distribution of fibrous dysplasia is classified as polyostotic (involving multiple bones) or monostotic (involving a single bone only). Of note, craniofacial fibrous dysplasia is considered a monostotic site even when multiple cranial bones are involved. 
McCune-Albright syndrome is the association of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia with autonomous endocrine hyperfunction and café-au-lait macules. Mazabraud syndrome is the association of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia with intramuscular myxomas. 
• Ossifying fibromas are benign bone neoplasms that most commonly occur in the mandible, followed by maxilla. Imaging shows a solitary, well-defined, expansile lesion with variable radiolucency/density. 


Malignancies of the sinonasal tract and anterior skull base 
Overview of sinonasal and anterior skull base malignancies 
• The most common malignant neoplasm in the sinonasal tract is squamous cell carcinoma, 
but this histology is not as overwhelming of a majority as in other mucosal sites of the upper aerodigestive tract. There are a wide variety of other malignancies. 
• Sinonasal epithelial cancers: 
Squamous cell carcinoma (most common). Adenoid cystic carcinoma. Non-salivary-type adenocarcinoma. Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC). Sinonasal neuroendocrine carcinoma (SNEC). 
• Nonepithelial sinonasal cancers: 

• Most of the various sinonasal malignancies have nonspecific imaging appearances and it is usually not possible to predict the histology with confidence. The role of imaging lies in localizing the tumor and evaluating the extent of disease, which affects the optimal 
treatment approach. 
Sinonasal malignancies are usually aggressive masses that cause extensive bony destruction. 
Internal contrast enhancement, though often heterogeneous, distinguishes neoplasms from inflammatory lesions such as hypertrophic mucosa, polyps, or obstructed secretions/mucocele. Owing to high cellularity, many of these malignancies have intermediate intensity (“evil gray”) on T2­
weighted images and more restricted diffusion. 
• Important findings to describe include the presence of perineural tumor spread, crossing the anterior skull base into the intracranial compartment, and extension into the orbit. 
Perineural tumor spread appears as nerve thickening and enhancement, obliteration of perineural fat pads, and/or enlargement of neural foramina/canals. Intracranial involvement may appear as nodular dural thickening or vasogenic edema in the brain. Orbital invasion most commonly occurs through the lamina papyracea, which is the weakest orbital wall. 

Squamous cell carcinoma 
• Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common sinonasal malignancy, most commonly 
affecting the maxillary sinus. 
• Major risk factors for sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma are smoking and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. 
Adenoid cystic carcinoma 
• 
Adenoid cystic carcinoma is the most common sinonasal tumor of minor salivary gland origin, most commonly affecting the maxillary sinus. 

• 
Adenoid cystic carcinomas have the highest risk of perineural spread. Those in the sinonasal tract most commonly affect the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V2). 



Adenocarcinoma 
• Sinonasal adenocarcinomas arise from surface epithelial glands, most commonly in the nasal 
cavity and ethmoid air cells, and are divided into intestinal-type and nonintestinal-type. 
• Intestinal-type adenocarcinoma is strongly associated with occupational wood dust exposure. 
Olfactory neuroblastoma (esthesioneuroblastoma) 

Esthesioneuroblastoma with intracranial extension: Axial and coronal post-contrast T1-weighted MRI demonstrate an avidly enhancing lobulated mass (arrows) extending from the right superior nasal cavity into the anterior cranial fossa. Multiple cysts are noted at the tumor-brain interface. 
• 
Olfactory neuroblastoma, previously known as esthesioneuroblastoma, is a malignant neural crest-derived tumor that arises from olfactory epithelium in the superior nasal cavity. 

• 
When the tumor extends intracranially, the presence of cysts at the margins of the intracranial portion is highly suggestive of olfactory neuroblastoma. 




Mucosal melanoma 
• 
Mucosal melanoma refers to malignant melanoma that arises from mucosal epithelium, which is uncommon compared to cutaneous melanoma. 

• 
The head and neck, most commonly in the sinonasal tract, is the most common site. 

• 
On MRI, internal high signal on T1-weighted images corresponding to melanin can be suggestive of the diagnosis, but these tumors are frequently amelanotic. 


Lymphoma 
• 
The most common histology is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, although in Asia and Latin America, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, is more common. 

• 
B-cell lymphomas predominate in the paranasal sinuses, while T-cell lymphomas predominate in the nasal cavity. 


Extramedullary plasmacytoma 
• 
Solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma is a plasma cell malignancy presenting as an extraosseous soft tissue mass; multiple myeloma is the systemic form. 

• 
Extramedullary plasmacytoma usually affects the head and neck region, most commonly in the sinonasal tract. 



Rhabdomyosarcoma 
• 
Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue malignancy in the head and neck in children and the most common sinonasal sarcoma. 

• 
Half of head and neck rhabdomyosarcomas occur in a so-called parameningeal site: nasal cavity, nasopharynx, paranasal sinuses, infratemporal and pterygopalatine fossae, middle ear, or mastoid. Parameningeal sites carry an unfavorable prognosis, while the orbits and other non-parameningeal head and neck locations are considered favorable sites.
