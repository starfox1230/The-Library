Overview and anatomy of the salivary glands 
Overview 
• 
The major salivary glands are, in order of decreasing size, the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands. 

• 
There are also numerous unnamed minor salivary glands throughout the mucosa of the head and neck, especially the palate. 

• 
Neoplasms in smaller glands are more likely to be malignant, with the risk highest in sublingual and minor salivary glands, followed by the submandibular gland, and least in the parotid gland. 


Parotid glands 
• 
The parotid glands are divided by the facial nerve into superficial and deep lobes. Since the facial nerve is not normally visible on imaging, radiologists use the retromandibular vein as the demarcation. 

• 
The deep lobe extends through the stylomandibular tunnel into the prestyloid parapharyngeal space, discussed later in this chapter. 

• 
The inferior projection of the superficial lobe overlying the angle of the mandible is called the parotid tail. 

• 
The parotid glands are the only salivary glands to contain internal lymph nodes, mostly located in the superficial lobe along the retromandibular vein. 

• 
Accessory parotid glands may be located along the parotid duct, which is also called Stensen duct, superficial to the masseter muscle. 


Submandibular gland 
• 
The submandibular glands sit partly in the floor of the mouth (sublingual space) and mostly in the neck (submandibular space). Each gland wraps around the posterior margin of the mylohyoid muscle, which separates the floor of the mouth from the neck. 

• 
The gland may remodel the adjacent inner surface of the angle of the mandible, causing a normal variant depression called a Stafne bone cavity/cyst. 

• 
The submandibular duct, which is also called Wharton duct, opens on the side of the frenulum of the tongue. 


Sublingual gland 
• 
The sublingual glands sit at the anterior aspect of the floor of the mouth. 

• 
Although normally confined to the sublingual space, the gland may herniate into the submandibular space through a normal variant discontinuity in the mylohyoid muscle called 


a mylohyoid boutonnière. 
• The sublingual glands drain via numerous small ducts, collectively termed Rivinus ducts, which may form a larger common duct, the Bartholin duct, that empties into the Wharton duct. 
Pleomorphic adenoma 


Pleomorphic adenoma: Axial T2-weighted (top left image), T1-weighted (top right image), and post-contrast fat saturated T1-weighted (bottom left image) MRI shows a T2 hyperintense, T1 hypointense, enhancing circumscribed mass (arrows) in the anterior aspect of the superficial left parotid.

Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. 
• Pleomorphic adenoma, also called benign mixed tumor, is the most common salivary gland 
tumor, accounting for 70% of all salivary tumors, and is most common in the parotid gland. 
• 
The typical patient is a middle-aged female. 

• 
MRI shows a well-defined mass with bosselated margins (small undulations), very high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, and strong contrast enhancement. Large pleomorphic 


adenomas can have heterogeneous signal. 
• Although pleomorphic adenoma is benign, there is risk of malignant transformation. The standard treatment for parotid pleomorphic adenoma is superficial parotidectomy. 

Warthin tumor 
• 
Warthin tumor, also called papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum or adenolymphoma, is the second most common benign parotid neoplasm. 

• 
The typical patient is an elderly male. The vast majority are smokers. 

• 
Imaging shows a well-defined but heterogeneous mass in the parotid gland with weak contrast enhancement and, in a significant minority of cases, complicated cystic 


components. 
• 
Multifocality or bilaterality accounts for up to 20% of cases of Warthin tumors, making them the most common multifocal or bilateral parotid neoplasms. They have a predilection for the parotid tail region. 

• 
Compared to pleomorphic adenoma, malignant transformation of Warthin tumor is rare. 



Mucoepidermoid carcinoma 
• 
Mucoepidermoid carcinomas are the most common primary salivary gland malignancy, especially in the parotid gland. 

• 
Low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma typically appears as a well-defined, enhancing mass that is hyperintense on T2-weighted images. This appearance is indistinguishable from benign pleomorphic adenoma on MRI. 

• 
High-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma has infiltrative margins and lower signal on T2­weighted images. 


Adenoid cystic carcinoma 


Adenoid cystic carcinoma with perineural spread: 
Axial post-contrast T1-weighted MRI demonstrates (top left image) a heterogeneously enhancing right parotid mass involving the superficial and deep lobes (yellow arrows). 
Axial (top right image) and coronal (bottom left image) post-contrast T1-weighted MRI through the skull base 
shows asymmetric enlargement and enhancement of the V3 division of the right trigeminal nerve and associated enlargement of the right foramen ovale 
(red arrows), consistent with perineural tumor spread. 
• 
Adenoid cystic carcinomas are the most common primary malignancy of the submandibular, sublingual, and minor salivary glands. They are also the second most common primary parotid gland malignancy. 

• 
Among head and neck malignancies, adenoid cystic carcinoma has the highest risk of perineural spread, which portends a poor prognosis. However, the most common histology of head and neck cancers to show perineural spread is squamous cell carcinoma. 

• 
Adenoid cystic carcinoma has a high risk of local recurrence and metastasis. 


Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma 
• 
Pleomorphic adenoma can undergo malignant transformation to so-called carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma. The risk accumulates over many years. 

• 
The typical patient is an elderly person with a long-standing parotid mass that is newly associated with rapid enlargement, pain, or facial nerve palsy. 

• 
In contrast to pleomorphic adenoma, carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma is hypointense on 


T2-weighted images and shows low ADC values. The malignancy is infiltrative, showing ill-defined borders and possible extension beyond the gland parenchyma. 

Metastases 
• 
Metastases to the parotid nodes (both within the gland and surrounding it) most commonly occur from cutaneous malignancies on the lateral side of the head, usually squamous cell carcinoma. 

• 
On imaging, a round parotid mass larger than 6 mm, sometimes with central necrosis or ill-defined margins, is suggestive of nodal metastasis in patients with a history of scalp or face 


skin cancer or concurrent cervical nodal metastases from other primary tumors. 
Lymphoma 
• 
Salivary gland lymphomas are rare. Most are non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas, particularly extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma). 

• 
Sjren syndrome is a strong risk factor, although most instances of salivary gland 


lymphoma are not associated. Any new dominant parotid mass in the setting of Sjögren 
syndrome should raise concern for lymphoma. 


Inflammatory salivary disease 
Sialadenitis and sialolithiasis 
• 
Sialolithiasis (stones within salivary ducts or glands) is the most common cause of acute unifocal sialadenitis, due to obstruction of the drainage and resultant gland inflammation. 

• 
The vast majority of salivary calculi and, in turn, cases of sialadenitis, occur in the submandibular gland and duct, due to its relatively viscous secretions and uphill drainage 


course. 
• 
Suppurative (acute bacterial) sialadenitis can occur without sialolithiasis, predominantly involving the parotid gland in elderly patients, often in the setting of recent surgery, intubation, dehydration, or poor oral hygiene. 

• 
The most common causes of multifocal/bilateral sialadenitis in children are juvenile recurrent parotitis (chronic parotitis) and mumps viral parotitis. 


Iodine-related sialadenopathy 
• 
Radioiodine sialadenitis is a common, dose-dependent side effect of iodine-131 therapy for thyroid cancer. Patients have transient salivary gland swelling and pain with decreased salivary flow. 

• 
Iodide sialadenitis, also known as iodide mumps, is a rare, idiosyncratic, non-allergic adverse reaction to iodinated contrast media administration. Patients have self-limited painless salivary gland swelling minutes to days after contrast-enhanced CT or angiography. 



HIV-related benign lymphoepithelial lesions

• 
HIV infection is frequently associated with benign lymphoepithelial lesions, which are mixed solid and cystic masses representing reactive lymphoid infiltration that causes proliferation of ductal epithelium with cystic change. 

• 
Benign lymphoepithelial lesions almost always involve the parotid gland. They are the most common parotid lesions in patients with HIV infection. Concurrent cervical lymphadenopathy is an additional clue on imaging for HIV infection. 



Sarcoidosis 
• 
Sarcoidosis occasionally involves the parotid glands with granulomatous inflammation, typically presenting as bilateral painless gland swelling. 

• 
Heerfordt syndrome, or uveoparotid fever, is the rare but pathognomonic presentation of sarcoidosis as bilateral uveitis, parotitis, and facial nerve palsy. 

• 
The panda sign of sarcoidosis is the finding on the obsolete gallium-67 scan of radiotracer uptake in bilateral lacrimal and parotid glands, superimposed on physiologic nasopharyngeal 


uptake. 
Sjren syndrome 

Sjögren syndrome: Coronal post-contrast T1-weighted (left image) and axial T2-weighted MRI with fat suppression shows numerous small, T2 hyperintense lesions in the left parotid (arrows), which demonstrate 
minimal peripheral enhancement. 
Case courtesy Mary Beth Cunnane, MD, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. 
• 
Sjögren syndrome is an autoimmune disorder affecting the salivary and lacrimal glands. 

• 
The typical patient is a middle-aged female. The disorder can be either primary or secondary to another autoimmune disorder (most commonly rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus). 

• 
MRI shows a salt-and-pepper or honeycomb appearance of bilateral parotid glands: multiple areas of high signal intensity mixed with discrete areas of low signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images, which represent a combination of benign lymphoepithelial lesions (also known as lymphoepithelial sialadenitis) with fibrosis, punctate calcifications, and fatty infiltration. 



IgG4-related disease 
• 
IgG4-related disease is a multisystem fibroinflammatory disorder, which can involve the submandibular and, less often, parotid glands. 

• 
Mikulicz syndrome refers to diffuse IgG4-related chronic sclerosing sialadenitis and dacryoadenitis. 

• 
Küttner tumor is a term for focal IgG4-related chronic sclerosing sialadenitis involving the submandibular gland. 


First branchial cleft cyst (BCC) 

Axial T2-weighted (left image) and T1 post-contrast MRI shows a left infra-auricular cystic lesion (arrows) along the superficial margin of the left parotid gland, thought to represent a first brachial cleft cyst. 
• 
Branchial apparatus (pouch or cleft) remnants include cysts, as well as sinuses and fistulas. 

• 
Branchial cleft cysts are most common and usually appear as a simple cyst. However, superinfection or hemorrhage can cause internal debris or wall thickening. 

• 
First branchial cleft cysts are located between the external auditory canal and the submandibular region, most frequently within the parotid gland. 



Sialocele 

Axial contrast-enhanced CT shows an ovoid fluid-density lesion (arrow) in the left sublingual space, adjacent to the sublingual gland, thought to represent 
a sialocele. 
• 
Sialoceles are focal pseudocysts of saliva due to gland/duct disruption, such as due to postobstructive rupture, trauma, or surgery. 

• 
Sialoceles are most commonly related to the parotid gland. 



Sialadenosis 
• 
Sialadenosis refers to chronic diffuse enlargement of the major salivary glands (typically the parotid) due to acinar hypertrophy. 

• 
The major risk factors are nutritional and hormonal disturbances, such as diabetes mellitus, alcohol use disorder, and eating disorders.
