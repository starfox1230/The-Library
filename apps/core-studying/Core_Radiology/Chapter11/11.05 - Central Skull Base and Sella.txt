Central skull base and sella 
Overview and anatomy of the sellar and parasellar regions 
Sellar and parasellar region 
• 
The sella turcica is a saddle-shaped depression of the sphenoid bone, which creates the space for the pituitary gland. 

• 
The anterior wall of the pituitary fossa is the tuberculum sellae. The posterior wall is the dorsum sellae. The roof is the diaphragma sellae, a dural reflection. 

• 
The parasellar region includes the cavernous sinuses, suprasellar cistern, and hypothalamus. 


Pituitary gland 
• 
The pituitary is composed of an anterior and a posterior lobe. 

• 
The anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis) produces and secretes the following hormones: growth hormone (GH), prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The anterior pituitary gland is formed from Rathke pouch, which is a superior invagination of primitive oral ectoderm. 


Rathke pouch normally involutes. Sometimes, a cleft can be left behind, which may give rise to craniopharyngioma or Rathke cleft cyst. 
• The posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis) and infundibulum (pituitary stalk) are the projection from the hypothalamus that transports and secretes antidiuretic hormone (ADH), vasopressin) and oxytocin. The posterior pituitary gland is formed from neuroectoderm. 
The normal posterior pituitary is hyperintense on T1-weighted MRI due to stored ADH and is called the posterior pituitary bright spot, best seen on sagittal images. Loss of the posterior pituitary bright spot has been associated with central diabetes insipidus but also occurs in some normal patients. 
The posterior pituitary normally descends from the diencephalon. Sometimes, the downward extension is halted, resulting in an ectopic posterior pituitary, usually at the median eminence (inferior aspect of the hypothalamus). 
The combination of ectopic posterior pituitary with an absent or hypoplastic infundibulum and anterior 
pituitary is known as pituitary stalk interruption (transection) syndrome. 


• The pituitary gland enhances on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI in accordance with its blood supply: first the infundibulum and posterior pituitary, followed by the anterior pituitary, which is supplied by the hypophyseal portal system. The entire gland enhances homogeneously between 30–60 seconds and then washes out. 


Cavernous sinus 
CN III oculomotor  nerve 
all extraocular muscles except SO & LR 
CN IV trochlear nerve 
superior oblique (SO) 
CN VI abducens nerve 
lateral rectus (LR) 
1 ophthalmic division 
sensory forehead region 
2 maxillary division sensory cheek region exits foramen rotundum 
exitsuperior orbital ÿssure 
The abducens nerve (VI) enters the petrous portion of the temporal bone through Dorello’s canal and is the only nerve that travels in the medial venous sinusoids. 
The maxillary nerve (V2) is the only nerve of the cavernous sinus that does not exit the superior orbital ÿssure. Instead, it exits foramen rotundum. 
• The cavernous sinuses are paired dural venous sinuses of the middle cranial fossae on either 
side of the sella turcica, connected by the variable intercavernous sinuses. 
• The cavernous sinus drains the (superior and inferior) ophthalmic veins and sphenoparietal sinus. 
The cavernous sinus is the most frequently involved dural sinus with infection and thrombosis (septic thrombophlebitis). Infection may spread from the central face (“danger zone”), paranasal sinuses, teeth, or orbits (discussed previously in the orbital infection section). 
• The cavernous sinus drains via the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses to the sigmoid sinus 
and jugular bulb, respectively. There are also connections to the pterygoid venous plexus and basilar (clival) plexus. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling (via the internal jugular vein) is performed to demonstrate pituitary ACTH hypersecretion in cases of suspected Cushing disease. 
• 
The internal carotid artery traverses the cavernous sinus. Rupture results in a direct caroticocavernous fistula (discussed previously in the ocular trauma section). 

• 
The cavernous sinus contains cranial nerves III, IV, VI, V1, and V2, and sympathetic fibers. CN VI and sympathetics around the carotid artery are located within the center of the sinus, while the other cranial nerves course between two dural layers within the lateral wall. 

• 
The lateral wall of the cavernous sinus is normally concave or straight. Outward bulging suggests involvement with a lesion, whether neoplastic, vascular, or inflammatory. 

• 
Cavernous sinus syndrome consists of clinical signs and symptoms attributable to cavernous sinus pathology, particularly neurologic deficits (ophthalmoplegia, facial sensory loss, Horner syndrome) and orbital/ocular congestion (chemosis, proptosis). Pain/headache may be present, especially in inflammatory disorders such as Tolosa-Hunt syndrome. 



Suprasellar cistern 
• The suprasellar cistern is the pentagonal basal cistern located above the sella, under the hypothalamus, between the unci of the temporal lobes, and anterior to the interpeduncular 
cistern. 
Supratentorial mass effect with uncal herniation effaces the suprasellar cistern from the side(s). 
Spontaneous intracranial hypotension reduces the height of the suprasellar cistern. 
• Multiple important neurovascular structures traverse the suprasellar cistern: Optic nerves and chiasm, infundibulum, and circle of Willis. 


Intrasellar lesions 
Pituitary adenoma 

Microadenoma: Coronal T2-weighted (left image) and sagittal T1 post-contrast MRI (right image) shows a subcentimeter T2 hyperintense, hypoenhancing lesion in the central pituitary gland (arrows). 
• 
Adenomas are by far the most common intrinsic pituitary mass but can have suprasellar extension when large. 

• 
Adenomas are classified by size as microadenomas (<10 mm) or macroadenomas (=10 mm). They are also classified by hormonal production, with the most common being lactotroph and nonfunctioning adenomas. 

• 
Patients present with symptoms of endocrine dysfunction (hypogonadism, acromegaly, Cushing disease, or hyperthyroidism) or, in the case of macroadenomas, mass effect (visual field deficits due to optic pathway compression, headache). 


Rarely, patients present with pituitary apoplexy, a clinical syndrome of severe headache, visual impairment, and hypopituitarism caused by sudden hemorrhage into the pituitary. The typical cause is 
pituitary adenoma. Sheehan syndrome refers to pituitary apoplexy in postpartum women associated with hypopituitarism. 
In the acute phase, imaging shows an enlarged pituitary gland possibly with high intrinsic T1 signal due to hemorrhage. Over time, the pituitary atrophies, leaving a partially empty sella. 
• 
Most cases are sporadic but syndromic causes include multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). 

• 
Microadenomas usually appear on MRI as foci of subtle signal abnormality within the gland on conventional sequences, but contrast-enhanced sequences improve sensitivity. Most microadenomas show delayed enhancement relative to the normal pituitary, which appears hypoenhancing based on the timing of most post-contrast protocols. Dynamic imaging with early and delayed phases is needed to detect a small subset of microadenomas.

Pituitary adenoma (continued) 
• 
As adenomas are typically slow-growing, macroadenomas enlarge and remodel the sella. 

• 
Pituitary macroadenomas can invade the cavernous sinus and encase the internal carotid artery. High risk of invasion is predicted on preoperative coronal MR images when the tumor extends laterally beyond the tangent line connecting the lateral walls of the supraclinoid and cavernous internal carotid artery segments. Complete encasement of the internal carotid artery certainly indicates cavernous sinus invasion but this sign occurs late. 

• 
As adenomas are typically soft, the diaphragma sellae can indent macroadenomas that extend into the suprasellar cistern, creating the snowman sign (also known as a figure-of-8, dumbbell, hourglass, or bottleneck configuration). They tend not to narrow the internal carotid artery (whereas meningiomas or metastases can narrow the carotid). 

• 
Macroadenomas can be heterogeneous due to cystic change, necrosis, or hemorrhage. Hemorrhagic pituitary adenoma is the most common sellar region lesion with intrinsic T1 hyperintensity, especially with a fluid level. 



Macroadenoma: FLAIR (left image) and post-contrast sagittal T1-weighted MRI shows complete replacement of the pituitary gland by an enhancing mass (yellow arrows). The optic chiasm is displaced superiorly (red arrow). 
Pituitary hyperplasia 
• 
The normal pituitary varies widely in size depending on age, sex, and hormonal status. 

• 
Physiologic pituitary hyperplasia commonly occurs in periods of hormonal activity like adolescence, pregnancy, and perimenopause. 

• 
Pathological pituitary hyperplasia is usually related to end-organ insufficiency, especially primary hypothyroidism. 

• 
On imaging, pituitary hyperplasia appears as a homogeneously enlarged gland with a convex superior margin. 


Hypophysitis 
• 
Hypophysitis refers to inflammatory infiltration of the pituitary gland and sometimes also infundibulum. It is classified by histology, with lymphocytic being most common, followed by granulomatous and plasmacytic. 

• 
Lymphocytic hypophysitis usually occurs in women, typically in the peripartum period. It is also a side effect of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy (e.g., ipilimumab and nivolumab). 

• 
Granulomatous hypophysitis can be idiopathic or secondary to systemic disorders such as sarcoidosis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s). 

• 
Plasmacytic hypophysitis is a rare IgG4-related disease. 

• 
MRI shows diffuse enlargement of the pituitary gland, and often the infundibulum, with homogeneous enhancement. 


Rathke cleft cyst 

Rathke’s cleft cyst: Axial FLAIR (left image) and coronal post-contrast T1-weighted MRI shows a FLAIR hyperintense, T1 hypointense parasellar mass (yellow arrows). The mass demonstrates faint peripheral rim enhancement. The pituitary is displaced to the right and the optic chiasm is displaced superiorly (red arrow). 
• 
Rathke cleft cyst is a remnant of the embryologic Rathke pouch lined with simple columnar or cuboidal epithelium. They are typically intrasellar with or without suprasellar extension. 

• 
Rathke cleft cysts are typically seen in middle-aged adults, twice as commonly in females. 

• 
Rathke cleft cyst is reportedly very common in autopsy studies (up to 22% incidence), but clinically is usually asymptomatic or discovered incidentally. 

• 
On imaging, Rathke cleft cyst is a nonenhancing cyst without calcification. An enhancing rim may be seen related to the pituitary tissue wrapped around the cyst (claw sign). A small, nonenhancing intracystic nodule, likely a clump of mucin, is pathognomonic. 

• 
The MR signal characteristics depend on the protein content of the cyst fluid. The intra-cystic fluid may be isointense to CSF if low protein and hyperintense on T1-weighted images if high protein. High protein content may cause incomplete nulling of the intracystic fluid on FLAIR. 



Empty sella 
• 
The (partially) empty sella is mostly filled with CSF and possibly slightly enlarged, due to herniation of the subarachnoid space (sometimes known as intrasellar arachnoidocele). The small pituitary gland is flattened against the floor of the sella. 

• 
The infundibulum sign, in which the pituitary stalk traverses this space, distinguishes empty sella from true cystic intrasellar lesions. 

• 
Primary empty sella can be a normal variant, especially in older patients, related to insufficiency of the diaphragma sellae, or be caused by intracranial hypertension. 

• 
Empty sella is one of a constellation of findings in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), which is a syndrome attributed to elevated CSF pressure in the absence of intracranial mass or hydrocephalus. 


Patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, who are typically female and obese, present with 
headache, transient visual obscurations, and/or pulsatile tinnitus. The main imaging findings are empty sella, papilledema/posterior scleral flattening, optic nerve sheath dilation, bilateral transverse sinus stenosis, cerebellar tonsillar ectopia, and meningoceles of Meckel's cave 
or petrous apex. 
• Secondary empty sella is related to prior pituitary disease. Gland shrinkage may reflect sequela of treated pituitary tumors, pituitary apoplexy, Sheehan syndrome, or trauma. 


Suprasellar / parasellar mass 
Overview 
• 
The differential diagnosis for a parasellar/suprasellar lesion is broad, but the imaging findings together with the patient's age and clinical presentation can usually narrow the differential diagnosis to a few entities. 

• 
The MOuSTACHE mnemonic may be helpful to remember the spectrum of parasellar/ 


suprasellar lesions, albeit not in order of prevalence: Meningioma/Metastasis. Optic pathway glioma. Sellar lesion with suprasellar/parasellar extension (e.g., macroadenoma). Teratoma and other germ cell tumors (e.g., germinoma). Aneurysm. Craniopharyngioma. Hypothalamic glioma or hamartoma. Epidermoid/dermoid cyst. 
• In adults, the most common suprasellar neoplasm is pituitary macroadenoma that has extended superiorly. The second most common suprasellar neoplasm and most common 
parasellar/cavernous sinus neoplasm is meningioma. The most common nonneoplastic 
parasellar mass is an arterial aneurysm. 
• In children, the most common suprasellar neoplasms are craniopharyngioma, followed by gliomas of the optic pathway or hypothalamus. A distinct subset of pediatric suprasellar neoplasms are those arising from the infundibulum, of which the most common are germ cell tumors and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. 
Meningioma 
• Meningiomas can arise anywhere along the skull base meninges, including the planum sphenoidale, anterior clinoid processes, tuberculum sellae, diaphragma sellae, dorsum 
sellae, and cavernous sinus wall. 
• 
As with meningiomas elsewhere, these tumors show uniform, intense contrast enhancement often with a dural tail. Meningiomas may cause adjacent hyperostosis due to vasoactive factors. 

• 
An important imaging finding of a parasellar meningioma is possible encasement and narrowing of the cavernous or supraclinoid internal carotid artery. 


Aneurysm 
• 
The suprasellar/parasellar region is the most common site of giant intracranial aneurysms. These typically arise from the supraclinoid or cavernous internal carotid artery. 

• 
Aneurysms are an important entity to consider in the differential diagnosis of suprasellar/ parasellar tumors to avoid a catastrophic biopsy. 

• 
Pulsation artifact or a flow void may be present on conventional MRI sequences. CTA or MRA would be diagnostic. 



Metastases 
• 
Malignancies rarely metastasize to the pituitary gland and stalk. 

• 
Breast cancer is the most common primary tumor to metastasize to the suprasellar/ parasellar region. Other tumors include lung cancer, lymphoma, and prostate cancer. 


Craniopharyngioma 

Craniopharyngioma: Noncontrast CT (left image) shows a hypoattenuating suprasellar mass (arrows) containing coarse calcifications. The suprasellar cistern is effaced. FLAIR MRI (middle image) shows an isointense, primarily solid suprasellar mass. Post-contrast T1-weighted (right image) MRI shows avid heterogeneous enhancement. There is a small cystic focus anteriorly (red arrow). 
• 
Craniopharyngiomas are benign (WHO grade I) neoplasms arising from Rathke pouch remnants that produce keratin. 

• 
Most craniopharyngiomas are suprasellar, although they may extend into or rarely arise within the sella. 

• 
Craniopharyngioma occurs in a bimodal age distribution but more commonly occurs in children. 

• 
In children, most craniopharyngiomas are the adamantinomatous subtype, which are complex cystic, lobulated masses with calcifications (similar to enamel). The cyst fluid is typically proteinaceous (described as machine oil or motor oil), which has a hyperintense appearance on T1-weighted images. 

• 
In adults, the papillary subtype is more common, which typically appears as a predominantly solid, enhancing, spherical, non-calcified mass. 



Germ cell tumors 
• 
Intracranial germ cell tumors arise in the midline, with the majority in the pineal region and next most commonly in the suprasellar region. 

• 
The majority of intracranial germ cell tumors are germinomas. Nongerminomatous germ cell 


tumors include teratoma, embryonal carcinoma, endodermal sinus tumor, choriocarcinoma, 
and mixed tumors. 
• 
The incidence peaks during adolescence. 

• 
Imaging shows a homogeneous, intensely enhancing midline mass. The mass is hypointense 


on T2-weighted images and dark on ADC map due to hypercellularity. 
Glioma 

Optic pathway glioma: Sagittal T1- (left image) and post-contrast axial T1-weighted MRI shows a suprasellar mass that is slightly hypointense relative to gray matter (yellow arrows), with diffuse enlargement of the adjacent optic chiasm (red arrow). The mass demonstrates avid heterogeneous enhancement. 
• Optic pathway gliomas, as previously discussed in the orbital section, can arise anywhere along the optic nerves, optic chiasm, and optic tracts. Hypothalamic gliomas are often considered together with this group due to difficulty distinguishing the site of origin in the 
suprasellar region. 
• These tumors are isointense on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and usually enhance. 
Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) 
• 
Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a multisystem, infiltrative neoplasm of children. 

• 
The most common endocrine abnormality in LCH is diabetes insipidus, due to involvement of the pituitary or its stalk. 

• 
Infundibular thickening and enhancement is the most common central nervous system imaging manifestation of LCH. 


Epidermoid and dermoid cysts 
• 
Epidermoid and dermoid cysts are benign congenital ectodermal inclusion cysts. 

• 
While dermoid and epidermoid cysts most commonly occur in the posterior cranial fossa, the most common supratentorial site is the suprasellar cistern. 

• 
As described earlier in the chapter, epidermoid cysts follow CSF signal on T1- and T2­weighted images, but are hyperintense on FLAIR and show restricted diffusion. 

• 
Dermoid cysts may contain intracystic fat, which can cause chemical meningitis or ventriculitis upon rupture. 


Hypothalamic hamartoma 

Hypothalamic hamartoma: Sagittal T1-weighted (left image) and axial FLAIR MRI shows a T1 isointense, FLAIR hyperintense suprasellar mass (yellow arrows) projecting inferiorly from the hypothalamus. The optic chiasm (red arrow) is normal, as is the anterior pituitary (blue arrow) and posterior pituitary bright spot (green arrow).

• 
Hypothalamic (tuber cinereum) hamartoma represents gray matter heterotopia arising between the pituitary stalk and the mammillary bodies. 

• 
Hypothalamic hamartoma is the most common mass causing central precocious puberty in children. These masses are also associated with gelastic seizures (laughing spells). 

• 
Hypothalamic hamartoma characteristically appears as a sessile or pedunculated mass at the floor of the third ventricle that does not enhance and is isointense to gray matter. 


Differential diagnosis of a suprasellar mass is highly dependent on age 



Clivus 
Anatomy and anatomic variants 
• 
The clivus is the sloping midline aspect of the central skull base formed by the sphenoid body and basiocciput. 

• 
These bones join at the spheno-occipital synchondrosis, which fuses during adolescence. 

• 
A normal variant canal located superiorly, in the midline sphenoid body, is the persistent hypophyseal canal (if <1.5 mm) or craniopharyngeal canal (if >1.5 mm), which connects the 


nasopharynx and sella. 
• 
Two notochord-derived clival variants located inferiorly are the canalis basilaris medianus (a long channel in the midline basiocciput) and the fossa navicularis magna (a notch in the anterior surface of the basiocciput). 

• 
The clivus transitions during normal aging from hematopoietic marrow with low signal on T1-weighted MRI to fatty marrow with high T1 signal. Low T1 marrow signal in an older adult is abnormal, which may be due to a neoplasm or diffuse systemic process. 


Ecchordosis physaliphora 

Ecchordosis physaliphora: Axial T2-weighted MRI (left image) and sagittal FIESTA (right image) shows a T2 hyperintense lesion (arrows) centered within the central clivus which extends intradurally into the prepontine cistern. There is no significant enhancement (not shown). 
• 
Ecchordosis physaliphora is a benign, ectopic notochordal remnant that projects from the dorsum of the clivus into the posterior cranial fossa. 

• 
On imaging, ecchordosis physaliphora appears as a small T2 hyperintense retroclival lesion, without contrast enhancement and often with a stalk and/or small bony defect in the adjacent clivus. Stability over time supports the diagnosis as opposed to chordoma. 


Benign notochordal cell tumor 
• 
Intraosseous benign notochordal cell tumor is a notochord-derived neoplasm that, unlike chordoma, is limited to the bone, associated with mild osteosclerosis rather than bone destruction, and shows minimal to no contrast enhancement. 

• 
They are usually asymptomatic. Long-term stability supports the radiologic diagnosis. 


Chordoma/Chondrosarcoma 


Clival chordoma: 
Sagittal T1-weighted MRI (top left image) shows replacement of the normal clival marrow by an isointense mass (arrows). 
Sagittal post-contrast T1-weighted MRI (top right image) shows heterogeneous enhancement of the mass (arrows). 
Axial T2-weighted MRI (bottom left image) shows a microlobulated, hyperintense clival mass with extension into the left petrous apex and opacification of the left middle ear and mastoid air cells.

Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. 
• Chordoma is a notochord-derived malignancy in adults that most commonly arises in the sacrum, followed by the clivus, and less commonly the vertebral column. Chordoma is the most common primary neoplasm of the clivus. 
• 
Chordomas show high signal on T2-weighted MRI and usually do not calcify. Key imaging features that distinguish chordoma from benign notochordal tumors are bony destruction, extraosseous extension, and contrast enhancement. Posterior tumor projection often indents the pons, creating the thumb sign on sagittal images. 

• 
Chondrosarcoma is a cartilage-derived malignancy in adults that, within the skull base, most commonly arises at the petroclival synchondrosis (petro-occipital fissure). 

• 
Chondrosarcomas show high signal on T2-weighted MRI and markedly elevated ADC values (higher than those of chordoma). CT can demonstrate the rings and arcs calcifications characteristic of chondroid lesions. 


• Because chordomas and chondrosarcomas frequently have overlapping imaging features, location is key in diagnosis. Chordomas tend to be midline, while chondrosarcomas are mostly centered off-midline. 
Secondary malignancies 
• As with other bones, the clivus can be a site of metastatic disease (e.g., breast cancer), local extension of soft tissue tumors (e.g., nasopharyngeal carcinoma), or involvement with hematopoietic malignancies (e.g., myeloma/plasmacytoma or lymphoma). 



Pterygopalatine fossa 

pterygomaxillary ÿssure     leads to masticator space 
sphenopalatine foramen     leads to nasal cavity via the     superior meatus 

anterior clinoid process 
optic canal superior orbital ÿssure 
foramen rotundum vidian canal 

inferior orbital ÿssure 
Anatomy of the pterygopalatine fossa (continued) 
• The pterygopalatine fossae are inverted pyramid-shaped spaces in the deep face that are important central stations for the spread of disease between the facial skull and middle 
cranial fossa. 
• 
The pterygopalatine fossa contains fat and neurovascular structures including the pterygopalatine ganglion, maxillary nerve (cranial nerve V2) branches, and distal maxillary artery branches. 

• 
Anteriorly, the pterygopalatine fossa is bordered by the maxillary sinus. 

• 
Posteriorly, the pterygopalatine fossa is bordered by the base of the pterygoid plates of the sphenoid bone, through which the foramen rotundum and Vidian canal are routes to the middle cranial fossa. The former carries the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve (V2), while the latter carries the Vidian nerve (nerve of the pterygoid canal). 

• 
Superiorly, the inferior orbital fissure is the base of the pyramid that opens anteriorly into the orbit. It transmits the infraorbital nerve, among other structures. 

• 
Laterally, the pterygomaxillary fissure is the exit to the masticator space or infratemporal fossa. 

• 
Medially, the sphenopalatine foramen is the exit to the superior meatus of the nasal cavity. It transmits the sphenopalatine artery, among other structures. 

• 
Inferiorly, the pterygopalatine canal is the apex of the pyramid that leads to the oral cavity 


via the greater and lesser palatine foramina. They transmit the greater and lesser palatine 
nerves and vessels. 

Pterygopalatine fossa pathology 
• The pterygopalatine fossa can be involved with neoplastic or inflammatory entities by direct invasion or perineural spread. 
Primary sites include the cheek (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma), maxillary sinus (e.g., invasive fungal sinusitis), nasal cavity and nasopharynx (e.g., juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma), palate (e.g., adenoid cystic carcinoma), masticator space (e.g., rhabdomyosarcoma), or orbit (e.g., idiopathic orbital inflammation). 
• Obliteration/infiltration of the fat of the pterygopalatine fossa with soft tissue is the earliest imaging sign of its pathological involvement. Later signs are widening or erosion of the bony 
walls. 
• Contrast enhancement and enlargement of the neural foramina/canals leading to the pterygopalatine fossa indicate perineural tumor spread.
