inferior orbital ÿssure palatine bone 
• 
The orbit is a conical cavity formed by 7 bones: frontal, ethmoid, palatine, lacrimal, maxilla, zygomatic, and sphenoid. 

• 
The orbital roof is part of the anterior skull base. 

• 
The orbital floor is the roof of the maxillary sinus. 

• 
Medially, the orbit borders the ethmoid air cells (across the lamina papyracea). Laterally, the orbit borders the temporal fossa (across the zygoma and greater wing of sphenoid). 

• 
The orbital apex is the region around three bony openings (optic canal, superior orbital fissure, and inferior orbital fissure) and the annulus of Zinn (common tendinous ring). 

• 
The following structures pass through the optic canal: 

• 
The following structures pass through the superior orbital fissure, which includes all of the cranial nerves (CN) of the cavernous sinus except CN V2: 



CN III (oculomotor nerve) innervates the superior, medial, and inferior recti, and inferior oblique muscles. CN IV (trochlear nerve) innervates the superior oblique muscle (mnemonic: SO4). CN V1 (ophthalmic division of trigeminal nerve) provides sensory innervation to the upper face. CN VI (abducens nerve) innervates the lateral rectus muscle (mnemonic: LR6). Superior ophthalmic vein drains into the cavernous sinus. Superior branch of inferior ophthalmic vein drains into the superior ophthalmic vein or cavernous sinus. 
• The following structures pass through the inferior orbital fissure, which includes several branches of CN V2 (maxillary division of trigeminal nerve) after it passes from the cavernous sinus through foramen rotundum and divides in the pterygopalatine fossa: 
Zygomatic nerve (from CN V2) provides sensory innervation to the skin of the lateral cheek and temple. Infraorbital nerve (from CN V2) provides sensory innervation to skin of the inferior eyelid, medial cheek, 
upper lip, and lateral nose. Inferior branch of inferior ophthalmic vein drains into the pterygoid venous plexus.

• 
The orbital septum divides the orbit (postseptal space) from the periorbital soft tissues (preseptal space). The septum is thin fibrous tissue that extends from the periosteum (periorbital) of the orbital rims towards the tarsal plates of the eyelids. 

• 
Classical teaching divides the orbit into four compartments: extraconal, conal, intraconal, and ocular compartments. The first three are also known as the retrobulbar space. 

• The extraconal compartment contains the lacrimal gland, some neurovascular structures, and fat between the muscles and orbital periosteum. Lesions of the bony orbit and extraorbital processes can encroach on the extraconal space. 

• 
The conal compartment refers to an imaginary cone formed by the rectus muscles and interconnecting connective tissue bands. 

• The intraconal compartment contains the optic nerve-sheath complex (optic nerve, surrounding CSF, and meninges), other neurovascular structures, and fat central to the myofascial cone. 

• 
The ocular compartment is the globe. Ocular lesions are not always included in discussion of “orbital” lesions even though the orbital cavity contains the globe. 

• 
In reality, fascial planes in the orbit are more complex and transcend the intraconal/ extraconal artificial boundaries. 



Lacrimal apparatus 
• 
The lacrimal apparatus consists of a secretory system and an excretory system. 

• 
The lacrimal gland, lodged in the superotemporal angle of the orbit, consists of a palpebral lobe and an orbital lobe (which is deeper and larger). 

• 
Tears drain via the lacrimal canaliculi near the medial canthus into the lacrimal sac, lodged 


in the lacrimal fossa at the inferomedial preseptal orbit. 
• The lacrimal sac empties via the nasolacrimal duct into the nasal inferior meatus. 

Orbital muscles 
• 
Six extraocular muscles move the eye: four recti (superior, inferior, medial, lateral) and two oblique (superior and inferior). 

• 
The rectus muscles arise from the annulus of Zinn. 

• 
The superior oblique muscle arises just superomedial to the annulus of Zinn. The tendon is reflected at the trochlea, a fibrocartilaginous structure attached to the superior nasal aspect of the frontal bone. 

• 
The inferior oblique muscle arises from the medial corner of the orbital floor. 

• 
The levator palpebrae superioris runs with the superior rectus in a muscle complex. The 


levator muscle (innervated by CN III) and Müller’s (superior tarsal) muscle (innervated by sympathetics) lift the upper eyelid. 

Globe 
• 
The globe has three layers: sclera, uvea, and retina. 

• 
The sclera is continuous anteriorly with the cornea. 

• 
The uvea is composed of the choroid, ciliary body, and iris. 

• 
The retina forms most of the inner surface, extending from the optic disc posteriorly to the ora serrata anteriorly. 

• 
The lens separates the anterior and posterior segments of the globe. 

• 
The iris separates the anterior and posterior chambers of the anterior segment, which communicate via the pupil. 

• 
The anterior segment is filled with aqueous humor, while the posterior segment is filled with vitreous humor. 



Optic nerve 
• 
Although named CN II, the optic nerve is a part of the central nervous system: it is surrounded by meninges, CSF, and myelin from oligodendroglia (rather than Schwann cells). 

• 
The optic nerve is divided into 4 segments: intraocular (optic disc/papilla/nerve head), intraorbital (the longest part), intracanalicular (within the optic canal), and intracranial (within the middle cranial fossa). 

• 
The two optic nerves converge at the optic chiasm in the suprasellar region. 




Orbital and ocular infection 
Overview of orbital infection 
• 
The most common etiology of orbital infection is direct spread of infection from the paranasal sinuses, especially bacterial rhinosinusitis involving ethmoid air cells. Other etiologies of orbital infection are trauma, foreign body, odontogenic infection. 

• 
Orbital infection includes a spectrum of entities ranging in severity from mild to vision- or life-threatening. 


Preseptal cellulitis 
• 
Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis involves the anterior soft tissues of the eyelids, superficial to the orbital septum. 

• 
Preseptal cellulitis is generally mild and much more common than orbital cellulitis. 

• 
Patients present with eyelid swelling and erythema. 

• 
Imaging shows subcutaneous fat stranding and swelling of the eyelids and face but normal orbital fat. 


Orbital cellulitis 

Orbital cellulitis with epidural abscess: Axial contrast-enhanced CT through the orbits (left image) shows left proptosis and both pre- and post-septal inflammatory change (red arrows), without a discrete fluid collection. There is complete opacification of the left ethmoid sinus and opacification of the sphenoid sinus. CT through the brain (right) demonstrates two locules of gas in the extra-axial space (yellow arrows) directly posterior to the left frontal sinus, representing an epidural abscess. 
Case courtesy Mary Beth Cunnane, MD, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. 
• 
Orbital (postseptal) cellulitis involves the muscles and fat deep to the orbital septum. 

• 
Orbital cellulitis is serious due to risk of complications such as abscess and intracranial spread via the valveless ophthalmic veins. 

• 
Patients present with not only eyelid swelling and erythema, but also painful ophthalmoplegia, chemosis, and/or proptosis. 

• 
Imaging shows orbital fat stranding, sometimes with extraocular muscle edema, proptosis, or an intraconal or extraconal phlegmon (inflammatory soft tissue mass that has not yet organized into an abscess). 


Subperiosteal abscess 
• 
Subperiosteal abscess is a suppurative collection involving the bony orbit under its periosteum (periorbital). It can arise associated with or independent of orbital cellulitis. 

• 
Imaging shows a convex rim-enhancing collection tracking along a bone surface, most commonly the medial orbital wall in the setting of ethmoid sinusitis. 



Orbital abscess 
• 
Orbital abscess is an abscess located within the soft tissues of the orbit, due to consolidation of orbital cellulitis or rupture of subperiosteal abscess. 

• 
Imaging shows, as with abscesses elsewhere, a focal rim-enhancing collection. 



Cavernous sinus thrombosis 
• 
The cavernous sinus is the most common site of septic dural venous sinus thrombosis, due to drainage of sites of medial facial, orbital, sinonasal, or dental infection. 

• 
Patients present with headache, fever, proptosis, chemosis, and cranial nerve palsies (e.g., ophthalmoplegia). 

• 
Imaging shows convex bulging of the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus and filling defects on post-contrast images. Indirect signs include dilatation (and/or thrombosis) of the superior 


ophthalmic vein. 
Endophthalmitis/panophthalmitis 
• 
Endophthalmitis refers to bacterial or, less commonly, fungal infection within the globe, involving the vitreous and/or aqueous humors. Further extensive involvement of the ocular wall and periocular orbital tissues is called panophthalmitis. 

• 
Most cases are due to direct inoculation, such as by trauma, surgery, or corneal ulcer. 

• 
Imaging shows thickening and enhancement of the ocular wall, periocular fat stranding, and 


abnormal high density/signal of the vitreous. 
Dacryoadenitis 
• Dacryoadenitis refers to lacrimal gland inflammation, which can be due to acute viral or bacterial infection. Other causes include idiopathic orbital inflammation, IgG4-related disease, and granulomatous diseases, which are discussed in the next section, as well as 
Sjren syndrome. 
• Dacryoadenitis appears as diffuse gland enlargement (unilateral or bilateral) that generally molds to orbital structures but may displace the globe inferomedially. 
Dacryocystitis 

Axial (left image) and coronal noncontrast CT through the orbits shows a rim-enhancement cystic structure in the left lacrimal fossa (yellow arrows) with surrounding soft tissue stranding, representing an enlarged lacrimal sac in the setting of dacryocystitis. Note communication with the nasolacrimal duct (red arrow). 
• 
Dacryocystitis refers to lacrimal sac inflammation typically secondary to nasolacrimal duct obstruction and subsequent bacterial infection. 

• 
In infants, dacryocystitis usually complicates congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (dacryostenosis) or dacryocystocele. Obstruction can also be acquired in older adults. 

• 
Dacryocystitis appears as a prominent rim-enhancing structure centered in the lacrimal fossa near the medial canthus with adjacent preseptal fat stranding. 




Orbital inflammatory disorders 
Idiopathic orbital inflammation (pseudotumor) 
• 
Idiopathic orbital inflammation, originally known as orbital pseudotumor, refers to an orbital mass or structure enlargement related to a nonspecific inflammatory infiltrate of unknown cause. It is diagnosed after excluding systemic autoinflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic etiologies. 

• 
Idiopathic orbital inflammation is the most common cause of a painful orbital mass in adults. Pain helps distinguish this entity from mimics (e.g., lymphoma, thyroid eye disease). 

• 
Most cases are unilateral and acute or subacute in onset. 

• 
The main anatomic subtypes and their imaging findings are: 


Idiopathic dacryoadenitis: diffuse lacrimal gland enlargement and enhancement. 
Idiopathic orbital fat inflammation: fat stranding and/or ill-defined soft tissue involving several structures. 
Idiopathic orbital myositis: smooth enlargement of one or several extraocular muscles; most commonly affects the lateral rectus muscle and also involves the anterior tendon (unlike thyroid eye disease). 
• Less common subtypes and their imaging findings include: 
Optic perineuritis: optic nerve sheath thickening and enhancement. 
Tolosa-Hunt syndrome: cavernous sinus thickening and enhancement. 

IgG4-related ophthalmic disease 
• 
Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease is a multisystem fibro-inflammatory disorder. The diagnosis requires histopathology or serology demonstrating IgG4 expression. 

• 
The orbit is the most frequently involved site in the head and neck. In turn, the most common site of IgG4-related ophthalmic disease is the lacrimal gland. Similar to idiopathic orbital inflammation, other common sites of involvement include the extraocular muscles and orbital fat. 

• 
A distinguishing feature in some cases of IgG4-related ophthalmic disease is infiltration/ enlargement of the infraorbital nerve. 

• 
The combination of lacrimal and major salivary gland involvement (parotid or submandibular) was previously called Mikulicz syndrome, and now termed IgG4-related chronic sclerosing dacryoadenitis and sialadenitis. 



Granulomatous diseases 
• 
Granulomatous inflammation in the orbit appears similar radiologically to idiopathic/ nonspecific inflammation but may be associated with a systemic disorder such as sarcoidosis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis. These more commonly affect the globe (e.g., uveitis, scleritis, conjunctivitis), but involvement of the extraocular orbit is better seen on imaging. 

• 
Sarcoidosis of the extraocular orbit most often involves the lacrimal gland, but it may also affect the optic nerve sheath, extraocular muscles, or orbital fat. Concurrent thoracic manifestations of sarcoidosis point towards the diagnosis. 

• 
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis can involve the orbit, with an infiltrative mass in the orbital fat being the most common type, followed by dacryoadenitis and then extraocular myositis, usually contiguous with sinonasal disease. 


Thyroid-associated orbitopathy 

Thyroid orbitopathy in a patient with Graves disease: Coronal (left image) and axial noncontrast CT through the orbits shows bilateral exophthalmos, increased orbital fat, and enlargement of inferior and medial rectus muscle bellies sparing the tendons (Coca-Cola bottle sign). 
• Thyroid-associated orbitopathy, also known as Graves ophthalmopathy/orbitopathy or simply thyroid eye disease, is an autoimmune disorder of the orbital soft tissues in patients with thyroid disease. Although usually associated with Graves disease (the most common cause of hyperthyroidism), it can also occur in patients with euthyroid or hypothyroid autoimmune thyroiditis. 
• The pathogenesis consists of inflammation involving the orbital muscles and fat, overproduction of glycosaminoglycans (mostly hyaluronic acid) by fibroblasts, and adipogenesis. 
• Thyroid-associated orbitopathy is the most common cause of proptosis and extraocular muscle enlargement. Imaging demonstrates proptosis with orbital fat expansion and mild fat stranding early in the disease and, with extended disease activity, fusiform extraocular muscle enlargement. 
• 
Thyroid orbitopathy tends to be bilateral and spares the muscle tendons. The longitudinal appearance of an enlarged muscle belly but a narrow anterior tendon is known as the Coca-Cola bottle sign of thyroid orbitopathy. 

• 
The inferior rectus muscle is most commonly affected first. The mnemonic I’M SLOw helps 

remember the order of involvement of the extraocular muscles: Inferior rectus • medial rectus • superior rectus • lateral rectus • obliques 

• 
Atypical features such as isolated lateral rectus involvement, anterior tendon enlargement, or unilaterality should prompt consideration of an alternative diagnosis, such as idiopathic orbital inflammation or neoplasm. 

• 
Severe muscle enlargement can crowd the orbital apex, resulting in dysthyroid optic neuropathy that may require surgical decompression if not responsive to steroids. 



Optic neuritis 

Optic neuritis due to multiple sclerosis: Coronal fat suppressed T2-weighted MRI through the orbits (left image) shows increased signal of the left optic nerve (arrow), with loss of clear distinction between the optic nerve and the surrounding normal T2 hyperintense CSF. The right optic nerve appears normal. There was no enhancement of the left optic nerve (not shown). 
Axial FLAIR (right image) shows numerous foci of T2 prolongation within the periventricular white matter (arrows), in a pattern consistent with multiple sclerosis. 
Case courtesy Mary Beth Cunnane, MD, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. 
• Optic neuritis refers to inflammation of the optic nerve. 
• Causes of optic neuritis include: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common. Aquaporin-4 antibody-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody-associated disease. Arteritic versus non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION versus NAION). Viral infection. Sarcoidosis. Lupus. 
Chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy (CRION). 
• 
The patients are typically young adults who present with acute, painful, central visual loss. In older patients, ischemic optic neuropathy is more likely than optic neuritis. 

• 
Acutely, the optic nerve shows enlargement, T2 prolongation, and contrast enhancement. Chronically, the optic nerve atrophies. 

• 
Concurrent brain white matter lesions support the diagnosis of MS. Note, however, the optic nerve is not one of the sites that can fulfill the McDonald criteria for dissemination in space. 




Multicompartmental orbital masses 
Lymphoma 

Orbital lymphoma: Coronal (left) and axial noncontrast CT through the orbits shows left-sided proptosis and an ill-defined, slightly hyperattenuating mass (arrows) in the left superior-lateral orbit. The mass conforms to the shape of the globe, rather than deforming it. The left lacrimal gland is not separately identified. 
• 
Orbital lymphoproliferative lesions are a spectrum ranging from benign reactive lymphoid hyperplasia to lymphoma. Most of these are ocular adnexal lymphomas (involving the support structures of the eye as opposed to intraocular lymphoma). 

• 
Lymphoma is the most common primary orbital tumor in older adults, although it may also be secondary to systemic disease. 

• 
The most common histology of orbital lymphoma is low-grade extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma). 

• 
Similar to the above inflammatory disorders, lymphoproliferative lesions can affect any orbital structure as a mass or diffuse infiltration but are most commonly extraconal, particularly involving the lacrimal gland. 

• 
Both lymphoproliferative and inflammatory masses tend to mold to the globe and other orbital structures. However, compared to idiopathic orbital inflammation, lymphomas have lower ADC values on MRI and clinically are unlikely to present with orbital pain. 


Plexiform neurofibroma 
• 
Plexiform neurofibromas are the most common type of orbital neurofibroma and are almost always associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). 

• 
Orbital plexiform neurofibromas typically involve trigeminal nerve branches, extending from the periorbital/preseptal soft tissues of the eyelid to the deep orbit, infiltrating both 


extraconal and intraconal compartments. 
• On imaging, plexiform neurofibromas appear as infiltrative, serpentine masses with variable contrast enhancement. Associated findings of NF1 may be seen on the orbital imaging study, including sphenoid wing dysplasia, buphthalmos (enlarged globe), and optic nerve glioma. 
Venolymphatic malformation (VLM) 
• 
Orbital venolymphatic (combined venous-lymphatic) malformations (VLM), previously called lymphangiomas, are congenital slow-flow vascular malformations that present in children and grow with the patient. 

• 
Orbital VLMs most commonly involve the extraconal compartment but may be found anywhere in the orbit. A key diagnostic clue is transspatial location with the mass spanning multiple compartments. 

• 
On imaging, orbital VLM appears as a multilocular cystic mass, often with complex internal contents and fluid-fluid levels from prior hemorrhage. Enhancement is variable, though 


typically peripheral and septal. 
Metastasis 

Scirrhous breast cancer metastasis: Coronal (left image) and axial CT through the orbits demonstrates ill-defined soft tissue in the left orbit (arrows), with loss of the normal definition of the optic nerve-sheath complex, medial rectus, and inferior rectus. Despite the presence of the mass, there is no significant proptosis. 
Case courtesy Mary Beth Cunnane, MD, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. 
• 
Orbital metastases arrive hematogenously and can form a mass or diffuse infiltrate in any compartment. Common sites are the choroid, bones, fat, and extraocular muscles. 

• In adults, the primary tumors are typically carcinomas and most commonly from the breast. Scirrhous breast cancer metastases characteristically can cause enophthalmos, whereas other primaries cause proptosis. 

• 
In young children, the most common source of metastases to the orbit is neuroblastoma. On cross-sectional imaging, these appear as an extraconal mass centered in the orbital lateral wall or roof with permeative bony destruction, calcifications, and aggressive periosteal reaction. 


Patients with orbital neuroblastoma metastases present with periorbital ecchymoses (raccoon eyes). Iodine-123 MIBG scintigraphy is the preferred study to detect bone metastases of neuroblastoma. 


Extraconal masses 
Dermoid cyst 
• Dermoid cysts are congenital ectodermal inclusion cysts made of keratinous and sebaceous debris. In the extracranial head and neck, the orbital region is the most common site of 
dermoids. 
• 
Orbital dermoid cysts are the most common extraconal mass in children. They occur near suture lines, most commonly in the superolateral quadrant at the zygomaticofrontal suture. 

• 
Imaging shows a circumscribed, unilocular cyst with at most thin rim enhancement, sometimes causing irregular bone scalloping. The internal contents can be heterogeneous but a fatty component or fat-fluid level, when present, is characteristic. 


Rhabdomyosarcoma 
• 
Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common extraocular orbital malignancy in children. 

• 
Orbital rhabdomyosarcomas are predominantly the embryonal subtype, which tend to arise in the superior orbital soft tissues. 

• 
Most orbital rhabdomyosarcomas are extraconal in location, but up to half have intraconal extension as well. 

• 
Imaging shows a solitary, circumscribed, enhancing soft tissue mass. 

• 
Isolated orbital involvement carries a favorable prognosis relative to parameningeal sites. Bone invasion and extraorbital extension classifies the tumor as parameningeal. 




Infantile hemangioma 
• Infantile hemangiomas, previously known as capillary hemangiomas, are the most common neoplasms of the head and neck, including 
orbits, in infants. 
• 
Infantile hemangiomas are characterized histologically by capillary-like vascular spaces lined with GLUT1-expressing endothelium and clinically by presenting weeks after birth (but are not present at birth). The course features proliferation during infancy followed by spontaneous involution in childhood. 

• 
Infantile hemangiomas can be superficial (cutaneous “strawberry hemangioma”), deep (subcutaneous), or combined. Most orbital/ Cavernous hemangioma: Axial T1-weighted post­periorbital infantile hemangiomas are entirely contrast MRI through the orbits demonstrates

patchy enhancement. 
• Imaging shows a lobulated, intensely enhancing

mass. Internal septations and flow voids on MRI Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. 
are typical. 
Peripheral nerve sheath tumors 
• Schwannomas and localized neurofibromas are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors with indistinguishable imaging appearances when they occur in the orbit. Schwannoma is more 
common. 
• 
The most commonly affected nerves are the extraconal sensory branches of CN V1. However, involvement of intraconal nerves is also possible. 

• 
Nerve sheath tumors are solitary, circumscribed, ovoid masses that are hypointense on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images (sometimes with central hypointensity, called the target sign), and contrast-enhancing. 


Lacrimal gland tumors 
• 
The most common lacrimal gland neoplasm is lymphoma. 

• 
Like inflammatory disorders, lymphoma usually appears as diffuse gland enlargement that molds to orbital structures like putty. 

• 
The most common lacrimal epithelial neoplasm is pleomorphic adenoma (benign mixed tumor), while the most common epithelial malignancy is adenoid cystic carcinoma. 

• 
Epithelial lacrimal gland tumors are usually masses arising focally from the orbital lobe that displace orbital structures like a marble (indenting the globe, distorting the extraocular muscles, and remodeling or destroying orbital walls). 

• 
Epithelial lacrimal gland tumors are unilateral. Bilateral involvement would be more typical of systemic inflammatory or lymphoproliferative disorders. 




Intraconal masses 
Optic pathway glioma 


Low-grade optic nerve glioma in a young adult: 
Axial T1-weighted post-contrast fat suppressed (top left image), axial T2-weighted fat suppressed (top right image), and coronal T2-weighted fat suppressed (bottom left image) MRI through the orbits demonstrates fusiform, T2 hyperintense enlargement of the distal right optic nerve (arrows) with no appreciable enhancement of the lesion. 
• 
Optic pathway gliomas, or simply optic gliomas, are the most common optic nerve tumors. 

• 
Optic gliomas most commonly occur in children. They are the most common central nervous system tumor in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), in whom bilateral 


involvement is frequent. 
• 
The most common histology is pilocytic astrocytoma, an indolent (WHO grade I) tumor with excellent prognosis. Malignant (high-grade) gliomas can occur in adults. 

• 
On imaging, low-grade optic gliomas appear as fusiform enlargement of the optic nerve with variable contrast enhancement. 


Optic nerve sheath meningioma 

Optic nerve-sheath meningioma: Axial post-contrast fat-sat T1-weighted image 
demonstrates marked enhancement 
surrounding the left optic nerve with a tram-track appearance (arrows). 
• 
Meningiomas are the most common tumors arising from the optic nerve sheath. 

• 
Optic nerve meningiomas usually occur in adults with a female predilection and rarely in children unless associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). 

• 
Patients present with slowly progressive visual impairment, classically with preservation of the central visual field (peripheral constriction). 

• 
On imaging, the nerve sheath appears circumferentially thickened, with uniform contrast enhancement and often calcifications. The enhancing tumor surrounding the nonenhancing optic nerve produces the tram-track sign on axial images and doughnut sign on coronal images. 



Cavernous venous malformation 
• 
Venous malformations, previously known as cavernous hemangiomas, are encapsulated slow-flow vascular malformations that are the most common orbital mass in adults. 

• 
Orbital venous malformations can be located anywhere but are usually intraconal. 

• 
MRI shows a well-defined mass that is isointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images, demonstrating patchy enhancement that slowly fills in. 



Orbital venous varix 
• 
Orbital varices are distended veins freely connected to the normal circulation, arising primarily as congenital malformations but sometimes secondary to arteriovenous malformations or fistulae. 

• 
Orbital varices represent the most common cause of spontaneous orbital hemorrhage but patients usually present with intermittent positional/stress proptosis. 

• 
Orbital varices appear as ovoid or tubular, intensely enhancing structures, often intraconal but not always. 

• 
Varices can be distinguished from other vascular lesions in that they demonstrate dynamic distension with maneuvers that 


increase venous pressure such as the Valsalva maneuver or prone positioning. Doppler ultrasound demonstrates slow flow. 



Ocular masses 
Ocular metastases 
• 
Metastases are the most common intraocular malignancies. 

• 
The uvea, typically the choroid, is the most common ocular site for hematogenous 


deposition of metastases due to its vascularity. 
• 
The most common primary tumor types are carcinomas, such as breast and lung cancer. 

• 
On imaging, metastases are typically irregular, enhancing masses broadly based on the choroid. 



Uveal melanoma 
• 
Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. 

• 
Most cases arise from the choroid or ciliary body and are discovered incidentally on fundoscopy. 

• 
On imaging, uveal melanoma is usually a mushroom-shaped or biconvex mass based at the uvea that shows intrinsic T1 hyperintensity and contrast enhancement. 

• 
The most common site of metastasis is the liver. 



Retinoblastoma 
• 
Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in children. 

• 
Patients usually present in the first few years of life with leukocoria (white pupillary reflex). 

• 
Unilateral cases are usually sporadic, due to somatic mutations in the 


tumor suppressor gene Rb. Bilateral 
retinoblastomas are due to heritable germline mutations in the gene, but family history is positive only in a 
minority. 
• 
On imaging, retinoblastoma appears as an enhancing retinal mass in a normal-sized globe. Calcifications are characteristic. 

• 
Trilateral retinoblastoma describes the association of bilateral retinoblastoma with pineoblastoma. The addition of 


a suprasellar tumor is quadrilateral 
retinoblastoma. 
• Survivors of heritable retinoblastoma treated with radiation have greater 
risk of a second malignancy many years later. The most common are osteosarcoma and leiomyosarcoma. 



Pediatric ocular and optic nerve non-neoplastic disorders 
Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) 

Retinopathy of prematurity: Noncontrast axial CT through the orbits shows bilateral microphthalmia with scattered orbital calcifications (red arrows). Peripheral high attenuation material in the right globe (yellow arrow) represents prior vitreous hemorrhage. 
Case courtesy Mary Beth Cunnane, MD, 
Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. 
• Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a disorder of retinal neovascularity in preterm infants, likely incited by hypoxia and hyperoxia. Complications include retinal/vitreous hemorrhage 
and detachment. 
• On imaging, both globes are small (microphthalmia) and often show increased attenuation on CT due to prior hemorrhage or neovascularity. 

Coats disease 
• 
Coats disease is an idiopathic disorder characterized by retinal telangiectasias and exudates that lead to retinal detachment. 

• 
Patients with Coats disease are predominantly boys, slightly older than those affected by retinoblastoma. 

• 
The globe is normal in size but features proteinaceous subretinal fluid that does not enhance. 


Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV) 

PHPV: Axial T1- (left image) and T2-weighted MRI through the orbits shows microphthalmia of the right globe with diffuse T1 hyperintense signal in the vitreous. There is a triangular retrolental soft tissue with linear stalk extending to the optic nerve head representing hyaloid remnant of the Cloquet canal (arrows). 
• Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV) is persistent embryonic vasculature within the vitreous that leads to hemorrhage, cataracts, and retinal detachment. Affected infants are typically full term. 
• On imaging, there is typically unilateral microphthalmia with increased attenuation/signal of the vitreous body. Characteristically, there is the martini glass sign of a Y-shaped soft tissue stalk along the hyaloid (Cloquet) canal of the posterior segment, extending from optic disc to the lens. 

Ocular coloboma 

Axial contrast-enhanced CT shows a large right posterior globe outpouching, representing a coloboma. 
• Colobomas are focal congenital defects (fissure, cleft, or outpouching) typically caused by incomplete fusion of the embryonic choroidal/optic fissure, but the term can be applied to 
defects in any structure in the eye and eyelid. 
• 
Colobomas are associated with numerous syndromes including trisomies 13 and 18 and CHARGE syndrome (coloboma, heart defects, atresia choanae, retarded growth and development, genitourinary anomalies, and ear anomalies). 

• 
On imaging, posterior colobomas appear as a focal bulge elongating the globe in the region of the optic disc. They are often associated with microphthalmia and a retrobulbar cyst. 


Septo-optic dysplasia 
• 
Septo-optic dysplasia is part of the holoprosencephaly spectrum of malformations, characterized by optic nerve hypoplasia, agenesis of the septum pellucidum, and often hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction. 

• 
On imaging, the bilateral optic nerves and optic chiasm are small and the septum pellucidum is absent. The posterior pituitary may be ectopically located. 

• 
In septo-optic dysplasia plus, there is associated polymicrogyria and/or schizencephaly, a full-thickness cleft in the cerebral hemisphere that creates a communication between the ventricles and the extra-axial subarachnoid space. 




Ocular trauma 
Globe rupture and foreign body 
• 
Globe rupture, or open-globe injury, is usually diagnosed on clinical examination but CT can be helpful in unclear cases or to exclude orbital foreign bodies. 

• 
CT features specific for globe rupture include flat tire sign of globe deformity (wall contour irregularity and decreased globe volume), change in anterior chamber depth, intraocular foreign body, or intraocular gas. 

• 
Increased depth of the anterior chamber suggests posterior segment rupture, while decreased depth suggests anterior segment rupture (e.g., corneal perforation). 

• 
Nonacute mimics include globe outpouchings (coloboma, staphyloma), pthisis bulbi (atrophic and calcified globe), focal ocular calcifications (optic nerve drusen, senile scleral plaques), and scleral bands or intraocular gas/air placed to treat retinal detachment. 



Ocular detachments and hemorrhage 
• Retinal detachment that is complete/extensive takes a “V” configuration, convergent on the optic disc and extending to the ora serrata. Vitreous, serous, or hemorrhagic fluid fills the subretinal space (between retina and choroid). 
Retinal detachment is most commonly related to retinal tears (rhegmatogenous), which can be traumatic 
or, more often, spontaneous related to posterior vitreous detachment. Myopia is a major risk factor. Non-rhegmatogenous causes consist of exudative effusion (e.g., infection, inflammation, neoplasm) or traction related to neovascularization. 

Retinal detachment: Axial noncontrast CT shows increased attenuation in the posterior left globe with a V-shaped configuration. 
• Choroidal detachment takes an hourglass configuration that diverges as it approaches the optic disc so as to spare the posterior pole of the globe, can extend anteriorly beyond the ora serrata, and can appose the retina at the convexities (kissing choroid sign). Serous or hemorrhagic fluid fills the suprachoroidal space (between choroid and sclera). 
The most common cause of choroidal detachment is ocular hypotony, which can be traumatic or, more often, related to recent surgery. Other causes are inflammatory, neoplastic, or vascular. 

Choroidal detachment in two different patients: 
Axial noncontrast CT (left image) shows extensive hyperdense hemorrhage in the left globe, including choroidal detachment with subchoroidal hemorrhage resulting in the kissing choroid sign (yellow arrow). There is also contour abnormality at the posterior globe concerning for open globe injury (red arrow). 
Axial contrast-enhanced CT (right image) demonstrates choroidal detachment of the left globe with hypodense subchoroidal blood products in an hourglass configuration. This was thought to be secondary to intraocular metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, as suggested by the nodular enhancement at the posterior globe (blue arrow), which was confirmed on subsequent MRI. 
• Vitreous hemorrhage appears as hyperattenuation of the posterior segment on CT. 
Causes of vitreous hemorrhage include trauma (including abusive head trauma in young children), spontaneous vitreous detachment and/or retinal tear, and conditions causing retinal neovascularity. Terson syndrome is the association of vitreous hemorrhage (and/or retinal hemorrhage) secondary to 
intracranial subarachnoid hemorrhage, likely related to elevated intracranial pressure. Nonacute mimics include intraocular silicone oil used to treat retinal detachment. 

Lens dislocation 
• 
Rupture of the zonular fibers that attach the lens to the ciliary body can result in displacement of the lens posteriorly or, less commonly, anteriorly. 

• 
In partial dislocations, the lens appears angled into the vitreous humor. In complete dislocations, the lens usually lies in the dependent portion of the vitreous. 

• 
Trauma is the most common cause of lens dislocation. The most common nontraumatic cause of lens dislocation (ectopia lentis) is Marfan syndrome. 


Retrobulbar hemorrhage 
• 
Retrobulbar hemorrhage is an accumulation of blood in the soft tissues behind the globe, which is usually due to blunt orbital trauma. 

• 
Traumatic retrobulbar hemorrhage is the most common cause of orbital compartment syndrome, which is a clinical diagnosis of elevated intraorbital pressure that impairs ocular perfusion. Soft tissue emphysema can also contribute to intraorbital pressure. Imaging may show proptosis, tenting of the posterior globe, and straightening of the optic nerve. 


Carotid-cavernous fistula 

Left carotid-cavernous fistula: Axial CT angiogram shows arterial phase filling of an enlarged left superior ophthalmic vein (left image, yellow arrow) and a distended left cavernous sinus (right image, red arrow). 
• Carotid-cavernous fistulas are arteriovenous fistulas that connect the carotid tree to the cavernous sinus. 
• Direct/high-flow fistulas (involving the cavernous internal carotid artery) are most common, usually due to trauma presenting acutely in young men. Indirect fistulas involve low-flow shunts from meningeal branches of the internal or external carotid arteries, presenting insidiously in postmenopausal women. 
• Indirect clues on imaging are signs of orbital congestion like fat stranding, extraocular muscle enlargement, and proptosis. CTA shows asymmetric enlargement and early contrast enhancement of the cavernous sinus and superior ophthalmic vein.
