
Overview of head and neck spaces 
• The complex layers of cervical fascia create several spaces in the suprahyoid neck. 
Knowledge of these spaces is useful in creating differential diagnoses for neck masses, as specific lesions tend to arise in characteristic locations. 

Retropharyngeal space 
pharyngobasilar fascia 
retropharyngeal space 
alar fascia 
prevertebral fascia 

prevertebral space 
the prevertebral space is the anterior component of the perivertebral space 
• 
The retropharyngeal space is a potential space located posterior to the pharynx, separated from the pharynx by the pharyngobasilar fascia. The retropharyngeal space extends from the base of the skull to the upper mediastinum. Directly lateral to the retropharyngeal space are the carotid and parapharyngeal spaces. 

• 
The alar fascia is directly posterior to the retropharyngeal space. The alar fascia separates the retropharyngeal space from another potential space, the danger space, which acts as a trapdoor for infection to travel all the way from the neck to the diaphragm. 

• 
The prevertebral space (the anterior component of the perivertebral space in the suprahyoid neck) is located just anterior to the vertebral body and is bounded anteriorly by the prevertebral fascia. 

• 
Benign and inflammatory lesions of the retropharyngeal space: 


A medially deviated internal carotid artery may mimic a mass on endoscopic evaluation or may be 
injured during spine surgery. Lipomas, fibromyxomas, and venous malformations can occur in the retropharynx. Spread of infection into the retropharynx can result in a retropharyngeal abscess, discussed later in this 
chapter. 
• Malignant lesions of the retropharyngeal space: 
Primary malignant lesions are uncommon. The most common malignant lesion is malignant lymphadenopathy, most frequently associated with nasopharyngeal SCC. Other primary tumors which are associated with retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy include: Papillary thyroid carcinoma, melanoma. 
Contiguous spread of primary tumors in the nasopharynx can involve the retropharyngeal space, such as 
nasopharyngeal SCC and rhabdomyosarcoma. 
Anatomy of the carotid space 

carotid space 

vagus nerve (X) (yellow circle) 
carotid jugularsheath vein 
Other cranial nerves passing through the carotid space:        glossopharyngeal nerve (IX)        spinal accessory nerve (XI)        hypoglossal nerve (XII) 
• 
The carotid space, or post-styloid parapharyngeal space, is an incomplete fascial ring surrounding the carotid artery and jugular vein. The carotid space extends from the skull base to the aortic arch. 

• 
The contents of the carotid space include the carotid artery, carotid body, jugular vein, and several cranial nerves. The vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) is the only cranial nerve that remains within the carotid space the entire way into the thorax. In contrast, cranial nerves IX, XI and XII pass transiently through the carotid space. Though there are lymph nodes surrounding the carotid space, there are no lymph nodes contained within it. 

• 
The pattern of displacement of vascular structures in the carotid space is the key to generating a differential diagnosis for a carotid space mass. 



Differential diagnosis of a carotid space mass 
• Paraganglioma 
Paragangliomas that occur in the carotid space include paraganglioma of the carotid body and paraganglioma 
of the vagal nerve. These demonstrate imaging 
characteristics similar to paragangliomas elsewhere in the 
head and neck, described previously. Paraganglioma of the carotid body (carotid body tumor or glomus caroticum tumor) splays the external and internal carotid arteries at the carotid bifurcation. 
Paraganglioma of the vagal nerve (glomus vagale tumor) displaces the internal and external carotid arteries 
anteromedially. 
• Schwannoma 
Similar to glomus vagale tumor, schwannoma (also most commonly of the vagus nerve) also displaces the carotid 
arteries anteromedially. Schwannoma, however, is not nearly as vascular as paraganglioma and does not have 
internal flow voids. 
• Neurofibroma 
Neurofibromas are almost always associated with neurofibromatosis type l. Neurofibroma and schwannoma are indistinguishable by MRI.

Anatomy of the parapharyngeal space 

• The prestyloid parapharyngeal space (PPS) is a triangular fat-filled space containing lymphatics, branches of the internal maxillary artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, and the mandibular (V3) nerve. 
• The direction of displacement of the parapharyngeal space fat by a mass in an adjacent compartment is predictable and helpful in determining from which compartment a given mass originates. Masticator space lesions (e.g., masticator abscess) displace the PPS posteromedially. Parotid lesions (e.g., pleomorphic adenoma) displace the PPS anteromedially. Carotid space lesions (e.g., paraganglioma) displace the PPS anteriorly. 
• Benign and inflammatory lesions involving the prestyloid parapharyngeal space: 
Parapharyngeal abscesses most frequently result from infections that arise in adjacent spaces, most commonly from the palatine tonsil, pharynx or are odontogenic in origin. 
Second branchial cleft cysts, discussed later, can present in the parapharyngeal space. 
Benign tumors, most frequently pleomorphic adenoma, arising from the deep portion of the parotid gland or salivary rests within the parapharyngeal fat can present as a mass in this space. 
Rarely schwannomas, usually arising from the sympathetic plexus or the mandibular (V3) nerve, can arise 
in this space. 
• Malignant lesions of the prestyloid parapharyngeal space: 
Malignant tumors are rare and when they occur are most frequently salivary gland in origin, such as mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and acinic cell carcinoma. 
Secondary invasion can be seen, most commonly from the pharynx, such as SCC or minor salivary gland carcinoma, and lymphoma, or the skull base, chordoma, chondrosarcoma, osteoma, osteochondroma, 
which are discussed elsewhere. 
Anatomy of the perivertebral space 

• 
The perivertebral space is formed by the deep layer of deep cervical fascia which wraps entirely around the prevertebral and paraspinal muscles. The anterior perivertebral space is synonymous with the prevertebral space. The perivertebral space is in the suprahyoid neck; the paravertebral space is the analogous region in the thoracolumbar spine. 

• 
The perivertebral space includes the longus colli-capitis muscle complex, the paraspinal muscles, the vertebral bodies, the neurovascular structures within the spinal canal, including the spinal column, exiting nerves, the vertebral arteries, as well as the brachial plexus. 

• 
Differential diagnosis of a benign lesion in the perivertebral space: 


Congenital lymphatic lesions (discussed later). 
Nerve sheath tumors arising from cervical nerve roots. Hemangiomas of the musculature. Benign bony tumors. 
• Malignant lesions in the perivertebral space: 
Malignant lesions are most frequently centered on the vertebral bodies, and therefore most frequently are metastases. 
Other differential considerations include primary vertebral body malignancies, soft-tissue malignancies arising from the perivertebral musculature such as lymphoma, rhabdomyosarcoma. 
Anatomy of the masticator space 

• 
The masticator space is located directly anterior to the parotid and contains the muscles of mastication, the mandible, and cranial nerve V3. Cranial nerve V3 (mandibular division) exits the skull through foramen ovale and innervates the muscles of mastication. If there is a lesion in the masticator space, it is important to assess for perineural spread along V3. 

• 
The temporomandibular joint also falls within the masticator space. 

• 
The majority of abnormalities that occur in the masticator space are a result of extension from neighboring spaces, such as the oral cavity, the parotid space, or the parapharyngeal or 


retropharyngeal spaces. 
Infections of the masticator space 

Masticator/submandibular abscess: Axial (left image) and coronal contrast-enhanced CT shows a peripherally enhancing irregular fluid collection (arrows) abutting the angle of the right mandible, with associated stranding of the subcutaneous fat. 
• 
Infections of the masticator space are more common than tumors. 

• 
Most infections are odontogenic in origin. Less commonly, extension of infection from parotid gland sialadenitis, extension of a palatine tonsillar abscess, or extension of a severe retropharyngeal space infection can be seen. 

• 
A masticator space abscess appears as an irregular, thick-walled, peripherally enhancing fluid located inferior to the mandible. Adjacent fat-stranding is usually present. 



Approach to tumors and non-neoplastic masses in the masticator space 
• Masses within the masticator space can be organized as masses arising from bone (mandible), arising within the nerve (branches of the mandibular nerve) or arising within the muscles of mastication. 
• Lesions arising from the mandible: 
Primary bone tumors arising from the mandible include osteoblastoma, osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma. Odontogenic lesions such as dentigerous cyst, keratocyst, or ameloblastoma can be seen in the mandible, and are more completely discussed in the oral cavity section.  
• Lesions arising within nerve: 
Anatomically, after exiting the skull base from the foramen ovale, V3 lies along the medial margin of the lateral pterygoid muscle. 
Schwannomas of V3 can smoothly expand the foramen ovale and present as a well-defined mass in the masticator space, with imaging characteristics similar to those of schwannomas elsewhere in the head and neck as described previously. 
• Lesions arising within muscle: 
Venous malformations (previously known as hemangiomas and lymphangiomas) can be seen, usually 
within the masseter muscle when present. 
Malignant masses arising from muscle include rhabdomyosarcoma, lymphoma, and metastases. 

Temporomandibular joint anatomy & pathology 


Right TMJ, closed mouth position Right TMJ, open mouth position 

Left TMJ, closed mouth position Left TMJ, open mouth position 
Sagittal T2-weighted MRI of normal and abnormal temporomandibular joints: 
Images of the right TMJ demonstrate normal disc position, shape, and signal on closed mouth view, and slightly limited disc mobility on open mouth image with abnormal retrocondylar T2 hyperintense signal representing a small joint effusion. 
Images of the left TMJ show an abnormally small condyle, and an anteriorly dislocated disc which appears thickened with intermediate T2 signal. On open mouth view, there is lack of normal mobility without change in disc position possibly representing “stuck disc” due to adhesions. 
• 
The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) can get dislocated and anterior meniscal dislocations are the most common. 

• Similar to other synovial joints, the TMJ can be affected by degenerative osteoarthritis and inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis, as well as crystalline arthropathies, which are discussed in greater detail in the “Musculoskeletal” chapter. 

• 
The TMJ can be affected by lesions such as pigmented villonodular synovitis, synovial chondromatosis and chondroid masses. 


Second branchial cleft cyst 

Second branchial cleft cyst: Coronal (left image) and axial contrast-enhanced CT shows a water-attenuation cystic lesion (yellow arrows) at the angle of the left mandible with minimal peripheral wall enhancement. This cyst is in the classic location of a second branchial cleft cyst: Posterior to the submandibular gland (red arrow), anterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle (blue arrow), and closely associated with the carotid sheath. 
Case courtesy Mary Beth Cunnane, MD, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. 
• A branchial cleft cyst is a congenital anomaly arising from the embryologic branchial apparatus. There are 4 types of congenital branchial cleft cysts, with the second type being the most common type. 
• 
A second branchial cleft cyst may occur at any point along the path extending from the palatine tonsil to the supraclavicular region, but occurs most commonly near the angle of the mandible. 

• The classic second branchial cleft cyst displaces the sternocleidomastoid muscle posteriorly, displaces the carotid artery and internal jugular vein medially and the submandibular gland anteriorly. 

• 
The cyst may become superinfected, suggested by wall enhancement and adjacent inflammatory changes within the surrounding soft tissues. Although second branchial cleft cysts are frequently in the posterior submandibular space, an infected 


second branchial cleft cyst would not typically be confused with a submandibular abscess. Submandibular abscess is usually due to dental disease, typically located immediately inferior to the mandible. 
• Branchial cleft cysts are uncommon in older adults. A cystic metastasis (e.g., from papillary thyroid cancer or base of tongue/tonsillar SCC) should be considered instead, especially if the cyst is irregular or has a mural nodule. 
• On imaging, there is opacification of the middle ear and mastoid air cells, often with bony erosion of the mastoid.
