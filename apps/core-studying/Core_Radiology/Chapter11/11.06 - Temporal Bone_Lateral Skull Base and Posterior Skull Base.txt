• 
The temporal bone can be anatomically and functionally divided into the external (outer), middle, and inner ear. Although some pathologies can overlap, each division tends to be susceptible to unique pathologies. 

• 
This anatomic and functional division parallels the pathway of sound waves into the brain. Sound enters the external ear, is amplified by the ossicles in the middle ear, and is finally 


converted into electrical impulses in the inner ear. 
• 
An additional function of the inner ear (not drawn above) is the balance and position sense provided by the vestibule and the semicircular canals. 

• 
Together, the cochlea, vestibule, and semicircular canals make up the labyrinth. The osseous wall is known as the bony labyrinth or otic capsule, while the internal structures are known as the membranous labyrinth. 



External ear 
Anatomy of the external ear 
• 
The external (outer) ear is composed of the auricle (pinna), external auditory canal (EAC), and tympanic membrane. 

• 
The EAC is a tube surrounded by fibrocartilage (laterally) and bone (medially) that sound passes through before reaching the tympanic membrane. 

• 
The bony part of the EAC is bordered posteriorly and superiorly by mastoid air cells, while the rest is formed by the tympanic part of the temporal bone. 


Mastoidectomy procedures are distinguished by whether the posterosuperior walls of the EAC are preserved (canal wall up mastoidectomy) or removed (canal wall down mastoidectomy). The tympanic part of the temporal bone develops in parts that normally fuse at the anteroinferior 
aspect in early childhood. Occasionally, incomplete fusion leaves a patent foramen of Huschke (foramen tympanicum), a dehiscence connecting the EAC and temporomandibular joint. 
• 
Sound waves vibrate the tympanic membrane, which transmits mechanical energy to the middle ear ossicles. 

• 
The tympanic membrane is divided into two sections: the pars tensa (larger, more inferior) and the pars flaccida (smaller, more superior). 


Congenital aural atresia/stenosis 
• 
Congenital aural atresia/stenosis is characterized by developmental narrowing or occlusion of the EAC, often associated with malformation of the auricle (microtia), ossicles (especially malleus and incus), and/or middle ear cavity. 

• 
The external and middle ear malformations are related by their development from the first branchial cleft, first and second branchial arches, and first branchial pouch. Associated 


anomalies of the inner ear are uncommon due to its separate origin from neuroectoderm. 
• Most cases are isolated, but aural atresia can be a part of several syndromes involving the first and second branchial arches, especially Treacher-Collins syndrome and craniofacial microsomia (inclusive of the prior terms hemifacial microsomia, Goldenhar syndrome, and oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum). 
Benign bony external auditory canal lesions 

Exostosis: Axial noncontrast CT through the right and left temporal bones shows broad-based bony exostosis in bilateral external auditory canals narrowing the canal lumen. 
• 
EAC exostosis, also known as surfer’s ear, is a non-neoplastic, reactive bony outgrowth projecting into the EAC seen in those who swim/surf in cold waters. It is more often sessile and multiple. 

• 
EAC osteoma is the most common osseous neoplasm of the temporal bone. It is more often 


solitary and pedunculated. 
Otitis externa (external otitis) 
• 
Otitis externa, also known as swimmer’s ear, refers to inflammation of the EAC. The most common cause is acute bacterial infection, most commonly with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 

• 
Necrotizing otitis externa, previously known as malignant otitis externa, refers to otitis externa complicated by temporal bone osteomyelitis. The most common risk factor is diabetes mellitus. 

• 
Imaging of otitis externa shows EAC soft tissue thickening, enhancement, and stranding. Specific findings of necrotizing otitis externa, as with osteomyelitis elsewhere, are cortical bone erosion on CT and marrow replacement on MRI. 

• 
Chronic otitis externa can result in medial canal fibrosis, which appears as crescentic soft tissue thickening over the outer surface of the tympanic membrane. 


Benign keratinous external auditory canal lesions 
• 
Keratosis obturans is an accumulation of keratin plugs that occludes and expands the EAC without bone involvement. The condition is more often seen in young adults and children, sometimes associated with sinusitis and bronchiectasis. 

• 
On imaging, keratosis obturans appears as EAC soft tissue opacification with smooth, expansile remodeling of the bony canal. Involvement is often bilateral. 

• 
Cholesteatoma is a collection of keratin lined by squamous epithelium, which rarely occurs in the EAC. EAC cholesteatoma more often occurs in middle-aged to older adults. 

• 
On imaging, EAC cholesteatoma appears as a soft tissue mass with focal bone erosion or sequestered bone fragments. Involvement is unilateral. 


External ear malignancies 
• 
The most common external ear malignancies are skin cancers: basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. 

• 
Within the external auditory canal, the most common malignancy is squamous cell carcinoma. Imaging shows an enhancing soft tissue mass with osseous erosion. 





Middle ear and mastoid 

muscle muscle 
• 
The middle ear (tympanic) cavity or cleft can be conceived of as a 6-sided box, further divided into compartments demarcated by the upper and lower borders of the tympanic membrane: epitympanum (attic or epitympanic recess), mesotympanum, and hypotympanum. 

• 
The contents include the ossicles (malleus, incus, and stapes), the tensor tympani and stapedius muscles, and part of the facial nerve. 

• 
The lateral wall of the middle ear cavity is the tympanic membrane, which is attached to the manubrium (handle) of the malleus. Sound reaching the tympanic membrane conducts through the ossicular chain and its articulations with each other (incudomallear and incudostapedial joints). At the end, the footplate of the stapes acts as a piston on the oval 


window. 
• The medial wall has the cochlear promontory and two membranous interfaces with the inner ear: the oval window, where sound energy enters, and the round window, which 
decompresses that energy after it travels through the cochlea. 
• 
The roof of the epitympanum is the tegmen tympani, which is part of the floor of the middle cranial fossa. 

• 
The posterior wall of the epitympanum contains the aditus (opening) to the mastoid antrum, which leads to the mastoid air cells. 

• 
The anterior wall of the hypotympanum contains the opening for the Eustachian tube, which leads to the nasopharynx. 

• 
The floor of the hypotympanum contains the jugular plate, which covers the jugular bulb.

Arterial variants 
• Arterial anatomic variants are among the causes of a red retrotympanic mass and of pulsatile tinnitus. 
• The most common of these is the aberrant internal carotid artery, which is an enlarged collateral pathway between the internal and external carotid artery trees involving the caroticotympanic artery and the inferior tympanic artery. CT shows a dehiscent carotid plate, soft tissue protruding into the anterior mesotympanum and coursing down over the cochlear promontory to the posterior mesotympanum, and an enlarged inferior tympanic canaliculus. 

Axial (left image) and coronal noncontrast CT through the left temporal bone demonstrates an aberrant carotid artery which extends laterally into the middle ear cavity with dehiscent bony covering, and coursing around the cochlear promontory (arrows). The ipsilateral foramen spinosum is not visualized (not shown), suggesting the presence of a persistent stapedial artery. 
• In a lateralized internal carotid artery, the petrous segment of the internal carotid artery protrudes laterally, with a thinned or dehiscent carotid plate, into the anterior 
mesotympanum. The inferior tympanic canaliculus is not involved. 
• A persistent stapedial artery is a branch of the hyoid artery connecting the external and internal carotid arteries, which normally regresses. CT shows soft tissue coursing from the petrous segment of the internal carotid artery, up over the cochlear promontory, and along the proximal tympanic segment of the facial nerve. The foramen spinosum is absent. 
Venous variants 
• 
Venous variants of the sigmoid sinus and jugular bulb are among the causes of pulsatile tinnitus and, in the case of dehiscent jugular bulb, of a blue retrotympanic mass. 

• 
Sigmoid sinus or jugular bulb dehiscence refers to a gap in the bony plates that separates the venous structure from the mastoid air cells or middle ear, respectively. 

• 
Sigmoid sinus or jugular bulb diverticulum refers to a focal outpouching of the vessel that protrudes into the temporal bone, with or without bony dehiscence. 

• 
High-riding jugular bulb describes when the dome of the jugular bulb rises to a higher than normal position (which is inconsistently defined), with or without bony dehiscence. Hearing or balance issues may result from encroachment on middle and inner ear structures. 



Paragangliomas 
• 
Paragangliomas are the most common primary middle ear tumors. Clinically, they typically present with pulsatile tinnitus or conductive hearing loss and appear on otoscopic evaluation as a red retrotympanic mass. 

• 
Paragangliomas are extra-adrenal neoplasms of sympathetic or parasympathetic paraganglionic tissue. In the head and neck, most arise from the parasympathetic, noncatecholaminergic glomus cells and therefore are called glomus tumors. Most are benign, but they can be locally aggressive. Less than 5% undergo malignant degeneration. 

• 
Most head and neck paragangliomas are sporadic but a significant minority are associated with a hereditary disorder: familial paraganglioma due to succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) subunit gene mutations, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), or von Hippel Lindau disease (VHL). 

• 
Paragangliomas tend to occur in a few locations in the head and neck: at the carotid bifurcation, in the suprahyoid neck along the course of the vagus nerve, at the jugular 


foramen, and in the middle ear. 
Glomus tympanicum tumor is a paraganglioma isolated to the middle ear, typically centered at the 
cochlear promontory along the Jacobson nerve (branch of CN IX). The jugular plate is preserved. Glomus jugulotympanicum tumor describes a paraganglioma that involves both the middle ear cavity 
and jugular foramen, eroding through the jugular plate. 
• Paragangliomas are highly vascular, avidly enhancing soft tissue masses. In larger tumors, the classic MRI pattern is the salt and pepper appearance due to intratumoral flow voids. Preoperative angiography with tumor embolization can reduce surgical blood loss. 

Glomus tympanicum: Coronal (left image) and axial post-contrast T1-weighted MRI demonstrates a heterogeneously enhancing lesion (yellow arrows) with apparent flow voids (red arrows) within the left 
middle ear. 
• As paragangliomas are neuroendocrine tumors that express somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2), the most sensitive modality for their detection is Ga-68 DOTATATE PET-CT. 
Cholesteatoma 

Middle ear cholesteatoma: Coronal (left image) and axial noncontrast CT through the right temporal bone demonstrates a soft tissue mass (yellow arrows) in the middle ear with near-complete erosion of the scutum (red arrow) and the ossicles, consistent with a cholesteatoma. There is opacification of the mastoid air cells. 
Case courtesy Mary Beth Cunnane, MD, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. 
• 
Cholesteatoma is a mass of exfoliated keratin lined by squamous epithelium in the temporal bone, which has been described as “skin in the wrong place.” The name cholesteatoma is deceptive since the lesion does not contain cholesterol crystals or fat and is not neoplastic. The histologically identical intracranial counterpart is the epidermoid cyst. 

• 
Cholesteatomas are among the causes of conductive hearing loss and of a white mass in the middle ear. 

• 
Cholesteatomas are classified by etiology into acquired and congenital forms but they are histologically identical. 


Acquired cholesteatoma represents the vast majority of cholesteatomas and can occur in both children and adults. Primary acquired cholesteatoma occurs in the setting of a tympanic membrane retraction pocket, which may be due to Eustachian tube dysfunction. Secondary acquired cholesteatoma occurs in the setting of tympanic membrane perforation, which may be due to chronic otitis media, trauma, or 
surgery. Congenital cholesteatoma is uncommon and likely represents persistent fetal epithelial rests. They 
typically present in children without a history of tympanic membrane perforation, retraction, or surgery. 
• The vast majority of cholesteatomas occur in the middle ear, although congenital cholesteatomas may also occur elsewhere in the temporal bone (e.g., EAC, mastoid, petrous apex). 
Acquired cholesteatomas most commonly arise in the Prussak space, a part of the epitympanum lateral to the neck of the malleus; these are known as pars flaccida cholesteatomas. 
In contrast, acquired pars tensa cholesteatomas and congenital middle ear cholesteatomas are typically medial to the ossicles. 
• CT is sensitive for the detection of even a small cholesteatoma, which appears as a well-circumscribed soft tissue mass opacifying part of the middle ear cavity. However, opacification is nonspecific and may reflect effusion, granulation tissue, or fibrosis. Adjacent bony erosion, such as the wall of the middle ear cavity (earliest involving the scutum in pars flaccida cholesteatomas) or ossicles (most commonly the long process of the incus), favors cholesteatoma. Erosions of bone covering specific structures outside the middle ear cavity are important to identify so that they may be protected during cholesteatoma surgery: Lateral semicircular canal, facial nerve, and intracranial compartment (e.g., tegmen tympani, sigmoid plate). 

Cholesteatoma (continued) 
• MRI is more specific for evaluating cholesteatoma, particularly in the postoperative surveillance setting, using DWI or post-contrast imaging. Similar to intracranial epidermoid cysts, cholesteatomas are hyperintense on DWI and do not enhance. Echo planar imaging (EPI) DWI techniques routinely used for the brain are prone to artifacts in the temporal bone, so non-EPI DWI is preferred for evaluation for cholesteatoma.

Cholesterol granuloma 

Petrous apex cholesterol granuloma: Axial T1-weighted (left image) and T2-weighted (right image) shows a lobulated T1 hyperintense, heterogeneously T2 hyperintense, expansile lesion in the left petrous apex (arrows). There is no associated restricted diffusion (not shown). 
• 
Cholesterol granuloma is a unique type of granulation tissue associated with friable blood vessels. Histologically, it represents a giant cell reaction to cholesterol crystals. 

• 
Cholesterol granulomas are most commonly located in a pneumatized petrous apex but can occur in any obstructed air space such as the mastoid and middle ear cavities. 

• 
Cholesterol granulomas in the middle ear may present on otoscopy as a blue retrotympanic mass or as hemotympanum. 

• 
Cholesterol granuloma can expand and thin the surrounding bone. On MRI, the lesions are typically hyperintense on T1-weighted images due to blood products and do not show restricted diffusion, unlike cholesteatoma. 



Otomastoiditis 
• 
Otomastoiditis refers to infection or inflammation in the middle ear and mastoid cavities. Various terms are used clinically to classify this spectrum based on duration (acute or chronic), presence and type of fluid (suppuration or serous effusion), and presence of tympanic membrane perforation and/or cholesteatoma. 

• 
An imaging finding of fluid in the middle ear and mastoid is common and not specific for clinically significant inflammation or infection. Otomastoiditis remains a clinical diagnosis, while imaging is reserved to detect complications such as those below. 

• 
Coalescent mastoiditis is the advanced stage of acute mastoiditis in which osteitis is present, defined on CT by resorption of the bony septae and thus merging of adjacent opacified mastoid air cells. 


Subperiosteal abscess results from coalescent mastoiditis that has eroded through the external mastoid cortex but remains contained by periosteum, usually in the postauricular region. Further progression through the periosteum is called a subcutaneous abscess. 
Erosion through the mastoid tip can result in abscess tracking either along the sternocleidomastoid muscle, called Bezold abscess, or along the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, called Citelli abscess. 
• 
Intracranial complications are the main cause of mortality in acute and chronic otomastoiditis, including meningitis, epidural abscess, subdural empyema, cerebritis, brain abscess, and dural venous sinus thrombosis. 

• 
Involvement of the inner ear (labyrinthitis) and petrous apex (petrous apicitis) are discussed later in this temporal bone section. 

• 
Intratympanic sequelae of chronic otitis media that can contribute to hearing loss include middle ear effusion, granulation tissue, cholesteatoma, cholesterol granuloma, post-inflammatory ossicular fixation (including tympanosclerosis), and ossicular erosion (especially at the long process of the incus). 





Intratemporal facial nerve 
Anatomy of the intratemporal facial nerve 
• The portion of the facial nerve within the temporal bone is divided into three segments: 
Labyrinthine segment: courses from the internal auditory canal to the geniculate ganglion (anterior genu), which is located superior to the cochlea. 
g Greater superficial petrosal nerve innervates salivation. 
Tympanic (horizontal) segment: courses posteriorly under the lateral semicircular canal to the posterior genu. 
Mastoid (descending) segment: courses inferiorly to the stylomastoid foramen. 
g
 Nerve to stapedius. 

g
 Chorda tympani (taste to anterior 2/3 of tongue). 


• The portions of facial nerve that may normally enhance (related to its peri/epineural vascular plexus) on MRI are the geniculate ganglion, tympanic segment, and mastoid 
segment. 
• Enhancement proximal to the geniculate ganglion, such as in the labyrinthine segment, or extracranial portion is abnormal. 
Facial nerve schwannoma 

Facial nerve schwannoma: Axial CT through the temporal bone in a child shows subtle enlargement of the tympanic segment of the left facial nerve canal (arrows). 
Case courtesy Sanjay Prabhu, MD, Boston Children’s Hospital. 
• Within the temporal bone, schwannomas of the facial nerve (CN VII) tend to be slow growing and most commonly involve the geniculate ganglion, followed by the labyrinthine 
and tympanic segments. 
• 
The majority of patients with facial nerve schwannoma present with facial nerve palsy; however, up to 30% present without facial nerve symptoms. Larger facial nerve schwannomas can interfere with ossicular function, causing conductive hearing loss. 

• 
On CT, the typical finding of a facial nerve schwannoma is enlargement of the bony canal through which the involved portion of the facial nerve passes. There is typically no calcification. The tumor usually demonstrates brisk contrast enhancement on MRI. 


Facial nerve venous malformation 
• 
Facial nerve venous malformations, previously described as hemangiomas, are perineural vascular lesions involving the petrous temporal bone. 

• 
Facial nerve venous malformation is most commonly seen in the region of the geniculate ganglion, followed by the IAC, and least commonly at the posterior genu. 

• 
This lesion characteristically has an expansile honeycomb appearance with intralesional bone spicules on CT, a pattern previously termed ossifying hemangioma. On MR, the lesion is characterized by heterogeneous signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging and avid 


enhancement. 
Idiopathic and infectious causes of facial nerve enhancement 

Axial post-contrast T1-weighted MRI demonstrates right facial nerve enhancement in the IAC (yellow arrow) and faint cochlea enhancement (red arrow), consistent with Ramsey Hunt syndrome in this patient with right facial weakness, sensorineural hearing loss, and a rash in the EAC. 
• 
In addition to schwannoma and venous malformations, the differential diagnosis for abnormal facial nerve enhancement includes infectious etiologies such as Lyme disease and herpes zoster oticus (Ramsay Hunt syndrome) and idiopathic facial neuropathy. 

• 
Idiopathic facial neuropathy, eponymously named Bell’s palsy, is the most common 


syndrome of acute-onset, unilateral facial weakness. Herpes simplex virus type-1 reactivation within the geniculate ganglion has been proposed as an etiology, resulting in demyelination and inflammation of the facial nerve. Facial paralysis is usually preceded by a 
viral prodrome. 
History and physical examination is generally sufficient for diagnosis. Imaging is generally performed to rule out other etiologies in patients presenting with atypical symptoms, recurrent symptoms, or slow recovery. The majority of patients have a complete recovery within 6 months. 
MRI demonstrates a uniformly enhancing, normal sized or mildly thickened facial nerve commonly 
extending from the intracanalicular segment to the tympanic segment. Enhancement may persist 
following clinical improvement. 
• 
Enhancement of the facial nerve accompanied by enhancement in the internal auditory canal and labyrinth, and vesicles within the EAC are suggestive of Ramsay Hunt syndrome. 

• 
Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. Clinically, these patients present with a rash and can have arthritis and myocarditis. 


Perineural tumor spread along the facial nerve 
• Parotid malignancies such as lymphoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma and adjacent skin malignancies that secondarily invade the parotid gland have a propensity for perineural 
spread along the facial nerve. 
• 
Facial nerve involvement occurs more frequently and in earlier stages in the extratemporal portion of the facial nerve. Proximally, the stylomastoid foramen segment and the descending segments can be involved. 

• 
MRI demonstrates enlargement of the facial nerve with patchy enhancement, enlargement of the stylomastoid foramen, or loss of the normal fat signal surrounding the nerve within the foramen. 





Inner ear 
Anatomy of the inner ear 
• 
The inner ear is situated within the petrous portion of the temporal bone and comprises the otic capsule (also known as the bony labyrinth). The otic capsule is the osseous superstructure containing the fluid-filled spaces of the cochlea, vestibule, and semicircular canals. The otic capsule is the densest bone in the body. 

• 
The cochlea is a conical structure consisting of a bony two-and-a-half turn spiral canal, including the basal, middle and apical turns, around a central core called the modiolus. The modiolus contains the cells of the spiral ganglion and corresponds to the exit of the cochlear nerve towards the internal auditory canal. 

• 
The spiral of the cochlea is separated by osseous spiral lamina and consists of the scala tympani, scala media, and scala vestibuli. 

• 
The scala media, also known as the cochlear duct, separates the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani, contains endolymph and the organ of Corti, the receptor organ for hearing 


comprised of sensory epithelium containing numerous neuroepithelial hair cells, which send electrical impulses to the spiral ganglia of the cochlea. 
• The scala tympani and scala vestibuli contain perilymph. They communicate at the apex of 
the modiolus by a small opening, the helicotrema. Hydraulic pressure created in the perilymph by the vibrations of the stapes against the oval window ascends to the apex of the cochlea by the scala vestibuli. Pressure waves descend back to the basal turn through the scala tympani. The vibrations from the scala tympani are transmitted through the round 
window, where the energy is dissipated. 
• The cochlear aqueduct, also known as the cochlear canaliculus, extends from the scala 
tympani to the subarachnoid space, opening on the inferior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. This theoretically allows for equilibration between the perilymphatic space and the subarachnoid space. 
• The vestibule is an ovoid perilymphatic space which is continuous with the cochlea anteriorly and the semicircular canals posteriorly, and contains the utricle and saccule, the 
sense organs involved in balance. The semicircular canals are oriented orthogonal to one 
another. 
• 
The vestibular aqueduct connects the crus commune (the common channel of the superior and posterior semicircular canals) to the posterior cranial fossa and contains the endolymphatic duct and sac. 

• 
The endolymphatic duct arises from the utricle and saccule and ends in a blind pouch, the endolymphatic sac, at the posterior margin of the petrous ridge. The endolymphatic sac acts as a reservoir for endolymph and the site for reabsorption into the epidural space. 


Congenital anomalies 
• 
Congenital anomalies of the inner ear are divided into two broad categories: malformations that involve only the membranous labyrinth and malformations that involve both the osseous and membranous labyrinth (e.g., malformed otic capsules). 

• 
Several types of membranous labyrinth malformation have been described, the classification of which is not useful radiologically as differentiation is made on histopathologic examination. 

• 
Conversely, radiologic identification and characterization of malformations of both the osseous and membranous labyrinth significantly impacts management strategy and prognosis and will be discussed in more detail. 


Type II incomplete partition (Mondini deformity) 

Axial noncontrast CT through the left temporal bone shows cochlear hypoplasia with 1.5 turns and a cystic apex representing fusion of the middle and apical turns (yellow arrow). The modiolus is deficient and the lateral interscalar septum is absent. An ipsilaterally enlarged vestibular aqueduct is also present (red arrow). 
• 
The most common form of congenital cochlear dysplasia, accounting for more than 50% of all cochlear deformities. It consists of a cochlea with 1.5 turns and absence of the interscalar septum and osseous spiral lamina. The basal turn appears normal and the middle and apical turns coalesce to form a cystic apex. 

• 
Although the correct nomenclature for this anomaly is incomplete partition type II, it is commonly and historically referred to as the Mondini deformity. The use of the eponym Mondini to describe cochlear dysplasia is controversial and probably best avoided, as there is confusion amongst radiologists regarding the exact malformation originally described. 

• 
There is strong association with an enlarged vestibule and enlarged vestibular aqueduct and normal semicircular canals. 



Type I incomplete partition (cystic cochleovestibular malformation) 
• Type I incomplete partition accounts for about 6% of all cochlear malformations. It is characterized by a complete absence of the modiolus, a cystic appearance of the cochlea, and a dilated appearance of the vestibule, forming a figure 8. The cochlea and vestibule are distinct, distinguishing from a common cavity. 
Common cavity 
• A common cavity accounts for about 25% of all cochlear malformations. It is defined by the absence of the normal differentiation between the cochlea and vestibule. 

Cochlear hypoplasia 
• Cochlear hypoplasia accounts for about 15% of all cochlear malformations. This results in aberration in the development of the cochlear duct during the sixth week of gestation. It is defined by the presence of a small cochlear bud arising from an abnormally small and deformed vestibule, usually with only one or a partial turn. Frequently it is accompanied by an abnormally small IAC. 
Cochlear aplasia 
• Cochlear aplasia is rare and accounts for about 3% of all cochlear malformations. It is characterized by an absent cochlea with a normal or deformed vestibule and semicircular 
canals. 

Complete labyrinthine aplasia (Michel aplasia) 

Axial noncontrast CT through the right temporal bone demonstrates absence of the cochlea, a dysplastic vestibule (yellow arrow), and hypoplastic semicircular canals (not shown). The IAC is small and stenotic (red arrow). 
• 
Michel aplasia is the most severe form of inner ear deformity and is defined by complete absence of the inner ear structures. On CT, an atretic IAC is seen without visualization of CN 

VIII. It is extremely rare, and accounts for only 1% of all inner ear malformations. 

• 
This can be unilateral or bilateral; however, when unilateral, the contralateral side is frequently also dysplastic. 

• 
This is frequently associated with abnormalities in structures arising from the otic capsule, including hypoplasia of the petrous bone, absence of the round and oval windows, flattening 


of the medial wall of the inner ear cavity. 

Enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome 

Axial noncontrast CT through the left temporal bone demonstrates an enlarged vestibular aqueduct (yellow arrow). Note size comparison to the adjacent semicircular canal (red arrow) 
• When CT imaging is positive for workup of unexplained sensorineural hearing loss, the most common finding is an enlarged vestibular aqueduct. The pathophysiology behind the association with an enlarged vestibular aqueduct and sensorineural hearing loss is not known. Multiple studies have shown that the probability of progressive hearing loss 
increases linearly with increasing width. 
• 
There is an association with other inner ear anomalies, such as modiolar deficiency and incomplete partition type II. 

• 
The measurement criteria are referred to as the Cincinnati criteria, which defines enlargement as >1.9 mm at the operculum and/or >0.9 mm at the midpoint in a child. 

• 
As an internal reference, the vestibular aqueduct should not be larger than the posterior semicircular canal, which is often seen at the same level in the axial plane. 




Causes of conductive hearing loss 
Otospongiosis (otosclerosis) 

Fenestral otospongiosis: Axial noncontrast CT Retrofenestral otospongiosis: Axial noncontrast through the right temporal bone demonstrates focal CT through the left temporal bone shows focal demineralization in the bone anterior to the oval demineralization of the cochlear capsule (yellow window (yellow arrow) at the fissula ante fenestram arrow). There is also demineralization of the fissula (red arrow). ante fenestram (fenestral otospongiosis, red arrow). 
• 
Otospongiosis, otherwise known as otosclerosis, is a primary bone dysplasia of the otic capsule characterized by replacement of normal endochondral bone by irregular spongy bone. Otospongiosis occurs most commonly in young and middle-aged women and is bilateral 85% of the time. 

• 
Patients present with predominantly conductive hearing loss earlier on, and a mixed conductive and sensorineural hearing loss later in the disease process. 

• 
The two main types of otospongiosis are fenestral and retrofenestral types. 


The fenestral type of otospongiosis is more common, occurs at the fissula ante fenestram (located directly anterior to the oval window), and usually affects the oval window. 
The retrofenestral (cochlear) type is thought to represent a more severe form with involvement of the otic capsule separable from the oval window, typically involving the cochlear capsule, with possible extension to the vestibule, semicircular canals, and IAC. Involvement of the cochlear promontory can result in a red-tinged appearance on otologic examination, termed the Schwartze sign. 
• 
CT is the best imaging modality for evaluation of otospongiosis. In the earlier, vascular phase, there is replacement of dense bone with demineralized bone, resulting in a less dense appearance. In a later, less active phase, the bone becomes more dense and sclerotic. 

• 
The differential diagnosis of cochlear demineralization includes retrofenestral otospongiosis, osteogenesis imperfecta in a child, fibrous dysplasia in a young adult, and Paget disease in 


an older adult. 
Round window occlusion 
• 
Round window occlusion can occur with inflammatory tissue, bone lesions, high-riding jugular bulb, or congenital absence. 

• 
These abnormalities can result in conductive hearing loss by adding resistance to acoustic energy entering the cochlea and requiring more energy to displace the basilar membrane. 



Superior semicircular canal dehiscence 
• A bony defect in the superior semicircular canal results in dispersion of sound energy along the canal, creating a “third window” with less energy available to the cochlea. The resultant drop in sound wave amplitude leads to conductive hearing loss. The abnormal movement of the endolymph can lead to a variety of vestibular and cochlear symptoms referred to as the “third window phenomenon.” 

Infectious and inflammatory conditions of the inner ear 
Labyrinthitis 

Acute labyrinthitis: Axial post-contrast T1-weighted MRI demonstrates increased enhancement within the inner ear (arrow). 
• 
Labyrinthitis is inflammation of the inner ear, which may be infectious or autoimmune. 

• 
Labyrinthitis has been divided into three stages of chronicity based on the imaging (primarily MR) characteristics. 

• 
Acute labyrinthitis is the earliest stage, presenting as pus in the inner ear. The only MRI signal abnormality of acute labyrinthitis is enhancement of the affected inner ear structures. 


The main differential consideration is a cochlear or intra-labyrinthine schwannoma. A schwannoma tends to be focal and discrete, while labyrinthitis may produce more diffuse enhancement. 
• Fibrous labyrinthitis represents the replacement of endolymph and perilymph with fibrous strands that cause decreased signal intensity on T2-weighted images. There may be mild (but decreased) residual post-contrast enhancement of the affected structures. 
• Labyrinthitis ossificans is the final stage of the disease. Calcified debris replaces the normal endolymph and perilymph. CT is the best way to image labyrinthitis ossificans, as the calcification causes decreased signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI and lack of enhancement. 

Labyrinthitis ossificans: Coronal noncontrast CT through the right temporal bone demonstrates partial mineralization of the anterior limb of the superior semicircular canal (arrow). 



Cerebellopontine angle (CPA) mass 
Overview and anatomy of the CPA 
porus acousticus 
internal acoustic meatus 
cochlea 
vestibule & semicircular canals 
facial nerve vestibulocochlear nerve basilar artery 

AICA 
cerebello­pontine angle cistern 
˜occulus of cerebellum 
lateral recess 4th ventricle 
4th ventricle 
• 
The cerebellopontine angle (CPA) is a region between the pons and cerebellum and the posterior aspect of the petrous temporal bone. Important structures of the CPA include the fifth (trigeminal), seventh (facial), and eighth (vestibulocochlear) cranial nerves, and the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA). 

• 
Most lesions of the CPA are extra-axial and located in the CPA cistern itself, although some may arise in the internal auditory canal (IAC), temporal bone, or rarely intra-axially from the pons or cerebellum. CPA masses are more common in adults. 


Schwannoma 

Vestibular schwannoma: Axial T2- (left image) and T1-weighted post-contrast MRI demonstrate a heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left cerebellopontine angle with an ice cream cone appearance that indents the cerebellar-pontine junction (yellow arrow) and protrudes into the internal acoustic meatus (red arrow). The porus acousticus is slightly widened (blue arrows).

• Schwannoma of the vestibulocochlear nerve, also known as a vestibular schwannoma, is by far the most common cerebellopontine angle mass, representing greater than 75% of all CPA masses. 
• 
Most frequently present in the fifth to seventh decades of life in sporadic cases and in the second decade of life in the setting of neurofibromatosis type II, which is associated with bilateral vestibular schwannomas. 

• 
Vestibular schwannoma is isoattenuating to the cerebellum on CT, hyperintense on T2­weighted images and avidly enhances. The characteristic ice cream cone appearance describes the “cone” protruding through (and widening) the porus acousticus and the “ice cream” exerting mass effect on the cerebellar-pontine junction. Schwannoma may become cystic, especially when larger. 

• 
Schwannomas of other cranial nerves in the CPA, including the facial or trigeminal nerves, 


are less common. Trigeminal schwannoma may extend into Meckel’s cave. 
Meningioma 

Prepontine/left CPA meningioma: Axial T2-weighted MRI (top left image) demonstrates a circumscribed, hyperintense, prepontine mass (yellow arrows). 
Axial pre-contrast T1 (bottom left image) and post-contrast T1-weighted (bottom right image) MRI 
shows that the mass avidly enhances and extends 
from the prepontine cistern into the left CPA and left porus acousticus (red arrow). There is also extension into Dorello’s canal on the left (green arrow), likely causing cranial nerve VI palsy. There is flattening of the pons. The basilar artery is nearly 180° encased and mildly narrowed (blue arrow). 
Case courtesy Gregory Wrubel, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 


• Although meningioma is overall the most common extra-axial mass in adults, it is only the second most common mass of the CPA, representing approximately 10–15% of all CPA 
masses. 
• 
Meningiomas often feature a short segment of dural enhancement and may induce adjacent bony hyperostosis. Approximately 20% calcify, in contrast to schwannomas where calcification is rare. 

• 
In contrast to schwannoma, a CPA meningioma seldom enlarges the porus acousticus. 


Arachnoid cyst 
• 
An arachnoid cyst is a benign CSF-filled lesion that is usually congenital. 

• 
An arachnoid cyst will follow CSF on all sequences. Unlike an epidermoid cyst, an arachnoid cyst does not have restricted diffusion. 


Aneurysm 
• 
Vertebrobasilar aneurysm (arising from the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, anterior inferior cerebellar artery, vertebral artery, or basilar artery) may appear as a well-defined, avidly enhancing CPA lesion and may be initially mistaken for a schwannoma or meningioma on contrast-enhanced CT. 

• 
On MRI, clues to a vascular etiology include flow void and pulsation artifacts. MRA or CTA are diagnostic. 


Epidermoid cyst 


Epidermoid cyst: 
Axial T2-weighted MRI (top left image) shows a lobulated mass (arrows) in the left cerebellopontine angle. The mass is isointense to CSF. 
ADC map (top right image) and DWI (left image) show that the mass (arrows) is dark on ADC and bright on DWI, consistent with reduced diffusivity. 
Case courtesy Gregory Wrubel, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
An epidermoid cyst is a congenital lesion arising from ectopic ectodermal epithelial tissue. 

• 
Epidermoid cysts progressively enlarge from desquamation of keratinized epithelium lining the cyst. The mass characteristically insinuates in between structures, encasing cranial nerves and vessels. Gross pathology features a characteristic “cauliflower-like” surface. 

• 
On CT, epidermoid cyst may mimic arachnoid cyst and appear as a CSF-attenuation cystic structure. On MRI, an epidermoid cyst has similar signal characteristics as CSF on T1- and T2- weighted images. Unlike arachnoid cyst, an epidermoid does not usually suppress on FLAIR 


sequences. 
• 
An epidermoid cyst is hyperintense on diffusion-weighted images, believed to be a combination of reduced diffusivity and T2 shine through, in contrast to arachnoid cysts. Post-surgical DWI follow-up is critical to detect any residual focus, which will be DWI bright. 

• 
Rarely, epidermoids may exhibit signal hyperintensity on unenhanced T1-weighted imaging, also known as “white epidermoids.” 


Intra-axial neoplasm 
• 
Less frequent benign lesions that can be seen in the IAC/CPA include lipomas and dermoids. 

• 
A posterior fossa intra-axial neoplasm, such as a hemangioblastoma or glioma, may invade laterally into the CPA. Other malignancies such as lymphoma, melanoma, and metastases can also be rarely seen. 

• 
Medulloblastoma tends to occur in the midline in children, though lateral involvement of the cerebellar hemispheres can be seen in older children or young adults. 

• 
Ependymoma may extend into the CPA by squeezing through the lateral fourth ventricular foramina (of Luschka). 

• 
Tumors related to the petrous bone (e.g., chondrosarcoma or endolymphatic sac tumors) may extend to the CPA. 




Temporal bone fractures 
• 
Temporal bone fractures have been historically described by their orientation with respect to the long axis of the petrous pyramid–longitudinal versus transverse–which classically leads to conductive versus sensorineural hearing loss, respectively. However, this traditional system does not correlate with clinical outcome or potential complications. 

• 
A newer classification system has been proposed, classifying fractures depending on whether the otic capsule is spared or violated. 


Otic capsule-sparing temporal bone fracture 

Axial CT through the temporal bone shows a nondisplaced fracture (arrow) 
extending through the axis of the 
petrous portion of the temporal bone. The otic capsule is spared. 
• 
Otic capsule-sparing temporal bone fractures are much more common than otic capsule-violating features, accounting for 94–97% of temporal bone features. 

• 
Otic capsule-sparing temporal bone fracture results from a temporoparietal blow and has an increased incidence of conductive hearing loss secondary to ossicular injury. 

• 
The most common cause of conductive hearing loss is related to hemotympanum or tympanic membrane rupture, which should resolve within a month of injury. Persistent conductive hearing loss should prompt evaluation for ossicular injury. 

• 
The most frequently injured ossicle is the incus because it has the least ligamentous support. Ossicular dislocation is more common than ossicular fracture. 


Otic capsule-violating temporal bone fracture 
• 
Otic capsule-violating temporal bone fracture is much less common. It can involve the vestibule, semicircular canals, cochlea and/or facial nerve. 

• 
It is often the result of an occipital blow and has a higher incidence of facial nerve paralysis, sensorineural hearing loss, and CSF fistula. 



Complications of temporal bone fracture 
Facial nerve injury 
• 
Facial nerve transection results in immediate facial paralysis. 

• 
Delayed facial nerve injury can present secondary to contusion, edema, or hematoma. 

• 
Severity and onset helps guide clinical management. Delayed onset incomplete facial paralysis may be treated with steroids and observation while surgical exploration is considered if there is concern for transection. 

• 
Important CT findings include: Bone fragments impinging on the facial nerve, extension of fracture to the nerve, and ossicles or hematoma impinging on the facial canal. 



CSF leak 
• 
CSF leak is a complication seen in 11–45% of temporal bone fractures and is seen 2–4 times more frequently in otic capsule-violating temporal bone features. 

• 
CSF leak is seen in fractures that involve the tegmen. 

• 
Clinically, patients present with CSF otorrhea and rhinorrhea, fullness in the ear, and conductive hearing loss. 

• 
Most cases occur in the first week after trauma and resolve with conservative medical management (strict bed rest). 


Labyrinthitis ossificans 
• 
Labyrinthitis ossificans occurs when fluid-filled lumen of the otic capsule following trauma is replaced by fibrous tissue (earlier stage) or bone (later stage). 

• 
Clinically this presents with sensorineural hearing loss and loss of vestibular function. 


Vascular injury 
• 
Arterial injury can occur in the form of dissection, pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, transection or occlusion. 

• 
Presence of carotid canal fracture is highly suggestive of injury to the passing internal carotid artery and should be evaluated with CT angiography. 

• 
Venous injury can manifest as venous sinus thrombosis or transection. CT venogram should be performed in cases where the fracture line traverses the venous sinuses. Complications of venous sinus thrombosis such as venous infarcts or hematomas should also prompt definitive evaluation. 




Petrous apex 
Anatomy of the petrous apex 
• 
The petrous apex is the most medial portion of the temporal bone 

• 
The petrous apex is a bridge between the suprahyoid neck inferiorly and the intracranial compartment above, and is adjacent to several important structures such as Dorello's canal, Meckel's cave, and the petrous portion of the internal carotid artery. 


Cranial nerve VI passes through Dorello's canal. Meckel's cave is the site of the trigeminal ganglion. 
• Normally, the petrous apex is composed of bone marrow and dense bone. The petrous apex is pneumatized in approximately 10% of the population, which increases the risk for development of a cholesterol cyst or apical petrositis. 
Cholesterol cyst (cholesterol granuloma) 
• 
A cholesterol cyst is a foreign body giant cell reaction to cholesterol crystals. It is thought to be initially instigated as a reaction to an obstructed air cell and therefore occurs more commonly in a pneumatized petrous apex. 

• 
A cholesterol cyst is the most common primary petrous apex lesion but may also occur in the mastoid portion of the temporal bone or the middle ear. 

• 
MR imaging of a cholesterol cyst shows an expansile mass with internal hemorrhage and fluid which does not suppress on fat suppression, unlike fatty marrow. 


Congenital cholesteatoma 
• 
While acquired cholesteatomas are located within the middle ear, congenital cholesteatoma can be located anywhere in the temporal bone, including the petrous apex. 

• 
MR imaging will typically show restricted diffusion. 



Apical petrositis (petrous apicitis) 
• A relatively rare complication of infectious otomastoiditis, apical petrositis is also known as petrous apicitis and results when infection extends medially into a pneumatized petrous 
apex. 
• 
In the early stages of apical petrositis, there is opacification of the petrous apex air cells with progressive bony demineralization and resorption, resulting in localized osteomyelitis of the skull base. 

• 
The classic Gradenigo triad is not commonly seen, but is comprised of otomastoiditis, facial pain due to trigeminal neuropathy at Meckel's cave, and lateral rectus palsy from sixth cranial nerve palsy at Dorello's canal. 

• 
Vascular complications of apical petrositis include internal carotid arteritis and dural venous thrombosis. 


Schwannoma 
• A petrous apex schwannoma may originate from cranial nerves V, VII, or VIII. Imaging shows a circumscribed, smoothly expansile, enhancing mass that may cause bony remodeling. Large tumors may become cystic and contain fluid levels. 
Langerhans cell histiocytosis (eosinophilic granuloma) 
• 
Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a neoplastic proliferation of eosinophils and Langerhans cells. The temporal bone is the most common site of skull base involvement. 

• 
CT shows a well-circumscribed destructive lesion, usually with nonsclerotic margins. 

• 
MRI shows the LCH lesions as soft-tissue masses surrounded by bone marrow and soft tissue edema. Marked enhancement is characteristic. 



Chondrosarcoma 
• Chondrosarcoma is a malignant neoplasm that characteristically arises in the midline from the clivus or slightly off-midline from the petro-occipital fissure. CT often shows a tumor with a ring-and-arc chondroid matrix, although internal matrix is not always seen. MRI shows a lobular, cauliflower-shaped, hyperintense mass on T2-weighted images. 

Chordoma 
• Chordoma (subsequently discussed in the section on clival lesions) most commonly arises from the clivus but may expand laterally to secondarily involve the petrous apex. In some circumstances it can be difficult to distinguish between chordoma and chondrosarcoma. 
Endolymphatic sac tumor 

Axial noncontrast CT (left image) demonstrates a destructive mass with internal calcification (arrows) centered at the posterior wall of the right mastoid air cells in region of the vestibular aqueduct, and involves the right IAC, semicircular canals, and middle ear cavity. Location of the mass suggests an endolymphatic sac tumor. 
Subsequent MRI shows the mass is intrinsically T1 hyperintense (axial T1-weighted image on the right), heterogeneously T2 hyperintense, and does not enhance. 

Endolymphatic sac tumor (continued) 
• 
Endolymphatic sac tumor is a locally invasive papillary cystadenomatous tumor. 

• 
Most cases are sporadic, but a minority of cases are associated with von Hippel-Lindau. 

• 
Endolymphatic sac tumor most frequently involves the region of the vestibular aqueduct in the retrolabyrinthine petrous bone. On CT, the affected bone has a moth-eaten, lytic appearance with intratumor bone spicules. On MRI, the presence of blood products results in intrinsic T1 hyperintensity. Enhancement is usually heterogeneous. 


Differential diagnosis of a petrous apex lesion 




Posterior skull base 
Anatomy of the posterior skull base 
• 
The posterior skull base is bounded by the posterior clivus anteriorly, the posterior aspect of the petrous temporal bone and condylar part of the occipital bone laterally, and the mastoid temporal bone and squamous occipital bone posteriorly. 

• 
The foramen magnum is formed within the occipital bone and transmits the medulla oblongata, vertebral arteries, anterior/posterior spinal arteries, and spinal accessory nerve. 

• 
Important foramina within the posterior skull base include jugular foramen and the hypoglossal canal, which are separated by the jugular tubercle. 

• 
A fibrous or bony septum divides the jugular foramen into anteromedial pars nervosa and posterolateral pars vascularis. 


Pars nervosa transmits cranial nerve IX (glossopharyngeal nerve) with its tympanic branch, Jacobson nerve, and the inferior petrosal sinus (mnemonic Nervosa Nine). 
Pars vascularis is larger and transmits the internal jugular vein, posterior meningeal artery, cranial nerves 
X (vagus nerve) and XI (accessory nerve), and Arnold nerve (auricular branch of CN X). 
• The hypoglossal canal transmits the cranial nerve XII (hypoglossal nerve). 
General approach to the posterior skull base 
• A large subset of lesions within the posterior skull base are not specific to the posterior skull 
base and can be seen elsewhere. These include: Fibro-osseous lesions such as fibrous dysplasia, Paget’s disease. Cartilage/bone tumors such as chordomas, chondrosarcomas, osteosarcomas, plasmacytomas, multiple 
myeloma, LCH. Vascular malformations. Metastases. 
• The most common lesions localized to the jugular foramen are glomus jugulare tumors, schwannomas, and meningiomas. Glomus jugulare tumors make up 80% of primary neoplasms arising from the jugular foramen. The typical 
patient is a woman in late middle age presenting with pulsatile tinnitus and conductive hearing loss. Imaging findings are similar to glomus tumors in other areas of the head and neck, as described previously. Bony changes of the jugular bulb can be used to differentiate these lesions on CT. Classically, glomus 
jugulare tumors cause permeative erosion, schwannomas cause smooth remodeling, meningiomas cause 
hyperostosis. 

Glomus jugulare tumor: Axial CT through the mastoid air cells shows permeative, moth-eaten bony destruction centered on the right jugular foramen (arrows). 
• Cerebellopontine angle tumors also localize to the posterior skull base and are discussed earlier in the chapter.
