Facial fractures 
Overview 
• 
Complex facial fractures are best described with respect to a handful of regional fracture patterns with attention to form and function rather than as a laundry list of bones or buttresses involved. 

• 
Displacement, fragmentation, bone loss, as well as region-specific anatomic considerations are important descriptors that influence treatment strategy. 

• 
A combination of multiplanar reformatted and 3D volume-rendered CT images are often helpful for diagnosis and surgical planning. 

• 
A panfacial fracture involves all thirds of the face: frontal bone, midface, and mandible. 




frontal sinus fractures 
naso-orbito-ethmoid (NOE) fractures 

nasoseptal fractures 
zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) fractures 
Le Fort fractures 

mandibular fractures 
Frontal sinus fractures 
• 
The management of frontal sinus fractures depends on the sites involved (anterior table, posterior table, and frontal recess), displacement, and comminution. 

• 
Involvement of the posterior table (which occurs almost always in addition to anterior table fracture) confers risk of CSF leak and intracranial infection. 

• 
Disruption of the frontal recess (frontonasal duct) confers risk of frontal sinus mucocele/ mucopyocele development. 



Orbital fractures 
• Fractures of the orbital rims and/or walls are part of several midface fracture complexes discussed separately below: naso-orbito-ethmoid, zygomaticomaxillary complex, and Le Fort 
II and III. 
• An orbital blowout fracture refers to a pure internal orbital fracture, which involves an orbital wall but spares the orbital rim, that expands the orbital volume. The most common types are orbital floor blowout, followed by medial orbital wall blowout. 

Orbital fractures (continued) 
• 
A trapdoor fracture is a special type of orbital floor blowout that usually occurs in children where the inferiorly displaced fracture fragment recoils and entraps herniated orbital soft tissue, which can cause restricted motility or necrosis of the inferior rectus muscle. Entrapment is a clinical diagnosis. 

• 
Large orbital blowouts (e.g., >2 cm2 defect area or >1.5 mL outward herniated volume) predict the development of noticeable enophthalmos after the acute swelling subsides. 



Naso-orbito-ethmoid fractures 
• 
Naso-orbito-ethmoid (NOE) fractures involve the upper central midface, classically along 5 key edges: from the pyriform aperture across the lateral nasal wall, inferior orbital rim and floor, medial orbital wall, frontomaxillary suture, and nasomaxillary suture. 

• 
NOE fractures are classified by the morphology of the central fragment where the medial canthal tendon inserts: 


Type I: noncomminuted large central fragment. Type II: comminuted central fragment not disrupting area of medial canthal tendon insertion. Type III: comminuted central fragment disrupting area of medial canthal tendon insertion. 
• Displaced NOE fractures can cause telecanthus (increased distance between the medial corners of the eyes) and obstruction of nasolacrimal and frontal sinus drainage pathways. 

Nasoseptal fractures 
• 
Nasal fractures are the most common facial fractures. Isolated nasal fractures should be distinguished from more serious naso-orbito-ethmoid fractures. 

• 
Most commonly, lateral-oblique forces fracture the bony nasal pyramid (nasal bones and/or frontal processes of the maxillae). Frontal forces additionally involve the anterior nasal spine and/or cartilaginous or bony nasal septum. 

• 
Associated septal hematoma can cause necrosis of the cartilage and subsequent saddle nose deformity. 


Le Fort fractures 


Pyramidal fracture, involves the inferior orbital rim, along with the orbital ˜oor and medial orbital wall. 
Allows free movement of the nose and hard palate (˜oating maxilla). 
Fractures involve the zygomatic arch, along with the lateral and medial orbital walls. 
Allows free movement of the entire midface (craniofacial dissociation). 

Le Fort fractures (continued) 
• 
Le Fort midfacial fractures detach the involved maxillary occlusion-bearing segment (palate, alveolus, and maxillary teeth) from the skull base (pterygomaxillary disjunction). 

• 
All Le Fort fractures involve the pterygoid plates of the sphenoid bone and maxillary sinus walls. Le Fort fractures are classified by the anterosuperior course of the fracture lines, which can occur alone or in combination on each side of the face (see illustration above). 

• 
Displaced Le Fort fractures at any level can result in malocclusion or midfacial deformity. Associated palatal fractures are common and contribute to malocclusion. 

• 
The non-occlusion-related components of the upper level Le Fort fractures can be treated as combinations of naso-orbito-ethmoid, zygomaticomaxillary complex, and/or orbital fractures. However, the reporting of Le Fort II and III fractures remains relevant as they are included among the Denver screening criteria for blunt cerebrovascular injury, which warrants CTA of the neck arteries and circle of Willis. 


Zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures 
zygomaticofrontal suture 
zygomaticomaxillary suture 

zygomaticotemporal suture 
zygomaticosphenoid suture 
• A complete zygomaticomaxillary complex (ZMC) fracture liberates a tetrapod fragment via suture diastasis or fracture near the 4 articulations of the zygoma: 
Zygomaticofrontal suture: along lateral orbital rim. Zygomaticomaxillary buttress: from inferior orbital rim and floor through maxillary sinus walls. Zygomaticotemporal suture: along zygomatic arch. Zygomaticosphenoid suture: along lateral orbital wall. 
• 
Also possible are incomplete fractures that involve an isolated limb of the ZMC, such as the zygomatic arch, lateral orbital rim/wall, or inferior orbital rim. 

• 
The appearance of the zygomaticosphenoid suture (e.g., displacement, angulation, telescoping) is a sensitive landmark for evaluating overall ZMC alignment. 

• 
Displacement or malalignment of ZMC fractures disrupt facial profile and width. 

• 
Because the orbital floor is involved in classic ZMC fractures, they are sometimes called orbitozygomatic fractures. As with other internal orbital fractures, ZMC fractures with significant orbital volume expansion can cause late enophthalmos. 



Mandibular fractures 
• 
Mandibular fractures are the second most common facial fractures and lead to malocclusion. 

• 
Mandibular fractures are described by the anatomic segments involved: condylar process (further divided into head, neck, and base), coronoid process, ramus and angle, body (from third molar to canine), and parasymphysis/symphysis. 

• 
Given its ring-like structure, mandibular fractures are more likely than not to occur at multiple sites. 


A guardsman fracture is the association of parasymphyseal and bilateral condylar fractures of the mandible. 
• 
Fractures that extend to the periodontal ligament space of an erupted tooth should be specially noted as they are managed as open (contaminated) fractures. 

• 
Displaced or complex mandibular fractures, particularly those involving the condyles, are associated with increased risk of blunt vascular injury and therefore warrant a neck CTA. 



Dentoalveolar trauma 
• 
Tooth fractures are classified by involvement of the crown, root, or both. Crown fractures are categorized by involved layers: enamel-only, enamel-dentin, or enamel-dentin-pulp. 

• 
Partial axial displacement of a tooth may be directed out of or into its socket, known as extrusive and intrusive luxation, respectively. Avulsion refers to complete displacement out of the socket. 

• 
Fractures of the alveolar process can spare the socket or involve the socket and allow eccentric displacement of a tooth from its socket, which is called lateral luxation.
