Neck infections and inflammation 
Ludwig angina 
• 
Ludwig angina is cellulitis of the floor of the mouth. It is an infection that can involve the submental, sublingual, and submandibular spaces. 

• 
The tongue may be posteriorly displaced, so ensuring airway patency is a clinical priority. 

• 
On imaging, there is stranding and swelling at the floor of the mouth. 


Retropharyngeal abscess

Lateral neck radiograph (top left image) demonstrates marked thickening of the prevertebral tissues (arrows). 
Sagittal (bottom left image) and axial contrast-enhanced CT demonstrate a peripherally enhancing fluid collection in the retropharyngeal space (arrows), causing effacement of the right oropharynx.

• 
Retropharyngeal infection may cause airway compromise. 

• 
In children, retropharyngeal infection is most often from spread of an upper respiratory tract infection, such as pharyngitis, which may cause the retropharyngeal lymph nodes that drain the pharynx to become suppurative and rupture. 

• 
In adults, retropharyngeal infection is most often due to penetrating injury, such as fish bone ingestion or instrumentation. 



Peritonsillar abscess 
• Peritonsillar abscess is a complication of peritonsillar lymph node suppuration, causing the characteristic hot-potato voice. 
Lemierre syndrome 
• 
Lemierre syndrome is venous thrombophlebitis of the tonsillar and peritonsillar veins, often with spread to the internal jugular vein. Immunocompetent adolescents and young adults 

are typically affected. 

• 
The most common infectious agent is the anaerobe Fusobacterium necrophorum, which is part of the normal mouth flora.
