Mucosal spaces: oral cavity, pharynx, larynx 
• 
The oral cavity is a space defined by the anterior 2/3 of tongue, bounded superiorly by the palate and inferiorly by the floor of mouth. 

• 
The pharynx is a muscular tube extending from skull base to the thoracic inlet. It is the anatomic center of the head and neck, around which the other suprahyoid spaces wrap. It is 


divided into the following distinct anatomic regions: 
Nasopharynx: Top of pharynx behind the nasal cavity. Oropharynx: From the level of the palate to the hyoid bone, behind the oral cavity. The posterior 1/3 of 
tongue is part of the oropharynx. 
Hypopharynx: From the hyoid bone to the esophagus, including the piriform sinuses and soft tissue 
lateral to the larynx. 
• 
Mucosal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) arises from the squamous lining of the pharynx, larynx, and sinonasal cavity. 

• 
The TNM staging system is used to classify SCC. “T” refers to the primary tumor extent, “N” to regional lymph nodes, and “M” for distant metastases. The criterion for T and N stage is individualized to each site (nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx) and in the case of the larynx to each subsite (supraglottic, glottic, and subglottic). Regardless of subtype, tumor size and lymph nodes are reported using the longest diameter, which is in contrast with lymph node measurements in other parts of the body. An exhaustive discussion of TNM staging is beyond the scope of this book, however some key points and differentiating factors are discussed below. 


Nasopharynx 
Overview and anatomy 
• The nasopharynx is located posterior to the nasal cavity and extends from the most cranial 
aspect of the pharynx (at the skull base) to the level of the soft palate. 
• In the midline of the nasopharynx is the nasopharyngeal tonsillar tissue, also known as the adenoid. This is where nasopharyngeal lymphoma can arise. 

Nasopharyngeal SCC 
• 
Most nasopharyngeal carcinomas arise from the fossa of Rossenmuller, which is adjacent to the opening of the Eustachian tube. The proximity explains why nasopharyngeal tumors result in middle ear effusion at the time of presentation. 

• 
Nasopharyngeal SCC frequently demonstrates minimal mucosal disease and may have significant extra-mucosal extension, most frequently to the parapharyngeal space and then 


the retropharyngeal space. 
• T staging of nasopharyngeal carcinoma is primarily defined by tumor extent/ invasion, and less on the size of the lesion as in other sites. T1 tumor is confined to the nasopharynx while extension to the parapharyngeal spaces, infiltration into surrounding muscles, the bony skull base, or intracranial extension results in a higher T stage. Given the importance of detection of skull base infiltration and intracranial extension of disease, MR is the preferred staging 
tool. 
• 
Lymph node metastases are common, and most frequently initially preferentially involve the retropharyngeal and high jugular (level II) nodes. 

• 
Treatment is most frequently non-surgical and a combination of chemotherapy or radiation, depending on the TNM stage. 



Thornwaldt cyst 
• A Thornwaldt cyst is a notochordal remnant that is usually asymptomatic, but may be a cause of halitosis. The typical location of a Thornwaldt cyst is in the midline nasopharynx. 

Axial T1-weighted (left image) and T2-weighted (right image) MRI show a well-circumscribed, T1 hyperintense T2 hypointense lesion in the midline nasopharynx, consistent with a Thornwaldt cyst containing proteinaceous 
material. 


Oropharynx 
Overview and anatomy 
• The oropharynx includes the posterior and superior pharyngeal walls from the level of 
the soft palate to the hyoid bone, and includes the posterior 1/3 of the tongue (i.e., base of tongue), the vallecula, the palatine tonsils.  The tongue base is the site of the lingual tonsillar tissue. The circumvallate papillae defines the anterior border of the oropharynx and 
separates the oropharynx from the oral cavity. 
• The soft palate is part of the oropharynx and the hard palate is part of the oral cavity. 
Oropharyngeal SCC 
• 
The most common locations for oropharyngeal SCC are the anterior portion of the tonsil and the tongue base. 

• 
In contrast to nasopharyngeal SCC, there are two TNM staging classifications for oropharyngeal SCC, depending on the p16 or high-risk HPV status. P16+/HPV-associated oropharyngeal SCC has a much better prognosis despite the tendency to have early nodal metastases and the staging scheme accounts for this.  Additionally, unlike nasopharyngeal SCC, the T-staging of the oropharynx is largely based on size criteria (T1–T3). 

• 
Evaluation of the pre-epiglottic fat space is important as involvement of this area results in upstaging to T3. Other areas that must be specifically addressed during staging include mandibular invasion, prevertebral muscle invasion which precludes surgical resection, pterygopalatine fossa invasion which raises the possibility of perineural spread, bilateral involvement of the base of tongue which has implications for surgical resection, and 


lymphadenopathy. 
• Treatment is dependent on the stage, with single-modality treatment with surgery or radiation in early-stage cancers and combined treatment in higher-stage disease. 


Oral cavity 

Overview and anatomy 
• 
The oral cavity includes the lips, the anterior 2/3 of the tongue, the buccal mucosa, the gingiva, the hard palate, the retromolar trigone, and the floor of the mouth. 

• 
The floor of the mouth, a substitute of the oral cavity, is bound by the mylohyoid muscle inferiorly, the tonsillar pillar posteriorly, and the mandible anteriorly, and includes the sublingual spaces and the deep portion of the submandibular gland as described below. 

• 
The sublingual spaces are a subsite of the floor of mouth and are bound by the intrinsic muscles of the tongue superiorly, the mylohyoid muscle inferolaterally, the mandible anteriorly, and the geniohyoid/genioglossus muscles medially. Important structures that run in the sublingual space include the lingual nerve (branch of the trigeminal), the glossopharyngeal and the hypoglossal nerve, as well as the sublingual gland and duct. 

• 
Directly inferior to the sublingual space is the U-shaped submandibular space. The sublingual space is separated from the submandibular space by the mylohyoid muscle anteriorly, although the sublingual space is contiguous with the submandibular space 


posteriorly.

Oral cavity SCC 
• 
SCC is the most common malignancy which occurs in the oral cavity and risk factors are similar to SCC of other subsites, such as smoking, chewing tobacco, and HPV exposure, although HPV exposure is much less strongly associated in comparison to oropharyngeal SCC. 

• 
The lip is the most common site of SCC of the oral cavity. Many of these lesions are easily assessed through direct inspection and imaging is indicated to evaluate for osseous invasion 


or lymph node metastases. 
• 
Oral cavity SCC staging is also largely based on the size of the lesion for determination of T1–T3 and unlike oropharyngeal SCC, there is only one staging scheme. 

• 
Key areas to evaluate in staging of oral cavity SCC include evaluating for mandibular/ maxillary invasion and involvement of the retromolar trigone. Involvement of the 


retromolar trigone cannot be determined clinically and provides access to numerous routes of spread. Other key areas of involvement include the pterygomandibular raphe, which provides access to the floor of the mouth and masticator space, extension to the 
oropharynx, extension to the larynx. 
• For primary oral tongue lesions, it is important to assess for extension across midline and involvement of the intrinsic muscles of the tongue. 
Dermoid/epidermoid 
• 
A dermoid is a teratomatous lesion which contains at least two germ cell layers, while an epidermoid contains only ectoderm. 

• 
On CT, both dermoid and epidermoid will appear as a fluid-attenuation lesion, most commonly in the midline of the floor of the mouth. A pathognomonic MRI finding of dermoid is the sack of marbles appearance resulting from floating fat globules. In the absence of this finding, epidermoid and dermoid can be indistinguishable in this location on MRI. 



Ranula 
• A ranula is a mucous retention cyst that arises from the sublingual gland as a sequela of inflammation. All ranulas arise from the sublingual gland or adjacent minor salivary glands and hence begin in the sublingual 
space. 
• A plunging ranula extends from the sublingual space into the submandibular space by protruding posteriorly over the free edge of the mylohyoid or by extending 
directly through a defect in the mylohyoid. 
• A dermoid cyst may also present below the mandible, but is typically midline, rather than the eccentric location of a plunging ranula. 

Thyroglossal duct cyst (TDC)

• A thyroglossal duct cyst (TDC) represents persistence of the thyroglossal duct. The thyroglossal duct follows the midline descent of the embryonic thyroid gland from the base of the tongue (foramen cecum) to its normal position in the neck. Most thyroglossal duct 
cysts present in childhood as an enlarging neck mass which elevates with tongue protrusion. 
• 
The majority of TDCs (65%) are infrahyoid, the rest found at the level of the hyoid or above. Most TDCs are midline, but they may occur slightly off midline, especially when infrahyoid. 

• 
Thyroid carcinoma (papillary type) is a rare complication seen in 1% of TDCs. 


Lingual thyroid 
• 
Lingual thyroid is ectopic thyroid tissue that has incompletely descended during embryologic development and remains at the floor of the mouth. Usually, the ectopic gland is the only functioning thyroid tissue, so the neck should be evaluated to confirm lack of normal gland. 

• 
Lingual thyroid is much more common in females. 

• 
Lingual thyroid is susceptible to standard thyroid pathology, including thyroiditis and cancer. 


Lymphatic malformations 
• 
Lymphatic malformations are congenital abnormalities that result when the embryologic lymphatics fail to connect to developing veins. There are three types of lymphatic malformations, classified by the size of the intra-lesional cystic spaces. 

• 
Cystic hygroma is the most common type of lymphatic malformation, the majority being present at birth and associated with chromosomal anomalies including Turner and Down syndromes. A cystic hygroma features large lymphatic spaces. The most common location is 


in the posterior triangle of the neck. 
• Cavernous lymphangioma has smaller lymphatic spaces than a cystic hygroma, while a capillary lymphangioma has the smallest cystic spaces. 


Odontogenic lesions 
Dentigerous cyst 

Sagittal (left image) and coronal (right image) contrast-enhanced CT show an unilocular lucent lesion (arrows) at the crown of the unerupted left third mandibular molar, consistent with a dentigerous cyst. 
• A dentigerous cyst is the most common type of non-inflammatory odontogenic cyst and forms when fluid accumulates between the follicular epithelium and the crown of an 
unerupted tooth. 
• This manifests as a well-defined, unilocular osteolytic lesion around the crown of an impacted tooth, most frequently around the crown of a mandibular third molar. 
Radicular (periapical) cyst 
• 
A radicular cyst is the most common odontogenic lytic lesion. It occurs in either the mandible or the maxilla and is associated with an infected tooth. 

• 
This can progress to bony dehiscence which results in extension of the inflammation to neighboring tissues and can progress to a soft tissue abscess. 


Ameloblastoma 

Coronal (left image) and axial (right image) noncontrast CT demonstrate an expansile, mixed-density, peripherally calcified mass in the left maxillary sinus associated with the root of an anterior left maxillary molar (arrow). Biopsy showed ameloblastoma. 
• 
Ameloblastomas are benign epithelial neoplasms and exhibit locally aggressive behavior. 

• 
These most commonly (80%) occur in the ramus and posterior body of the mandible. 


Ameloblastoma (continued) 
• 
These classically and more frequently appear as multilocular lytic lesions with mixed cystic and solid regions. 

• 
However, 40% of the time, these can appear unilocular and are indistinguishable from odontogenic keratocysts or dentigerous cysts. In comparison to odontogenic keratocyst, an ameloblastoma is more likely to be predominantly cystic, while odontogenic keratocysts have debris resulting in a more heterogeneous appearance on T2-weighted imaging on MRI and lower mean value on ADC. 


Odontogenic keratocyst 

Sagittal (left image) and axial (right image) contrast-enhanced CT show an unilocular expansile lucent lesion (arrows) in the left mandibular body abutting the root of a left mandibular molar. Pathology upon resection 
showed odontogenic keratocyst. 
• A keratocystic odontogenic tumor is a benign unilocular expansile lucent lesion, most frequently seen in the body and ramus of the mandible. As described above, it is more likely to be heterogeneous on T2 and is not associated with buccolingual expansion in the mandible. However, when it is multilocular, it cannot be reliably distinguished from an ameloblastoma based on imaging.  
Differential diagnosis of lytic odontogenic lesions 



Hypopharynx 
Overview and anatomy 
• The hypopharynx is the inferior continuation of the oropharynx. It surrounds the larynx on three sides and extends to the level of the inferior border of the larynx, and continues inferiorly as the cervical esophagus. The hypopharynx can be divided into three regions: the 
piriform sinuses, the posterior pharyngeal wall, and the posterior cricoid region. 
• The aryepiglottic folds separate the hypopharynx from the supraglottic larynx. Tumors arising from these folds are staged as supraglottic tumors (described in the larynx section below).  
Hypopharyngeal SCC 
• 
Most hypopharyngeal SCCs arise in the pyriform sinus. Staging of hypopharyngeal SCC is dependent on both the lesion size and invasion of adjacent structures. 

• 
Important imaging findings to evaluate for during staging include: Fixation of the hemilarynx; assessment of local invasion including potential involvement of the esophageal mucosa, thyroid/cricoid cartilage, hyoid bone, and prevertebral fascia; and vascular involvement such as encasement of the carotid artery or mediastinal structures. 




Larynx 
Overview and anatomy 
epiglottis 

aryepiglottic fold piriform sinus 
posterior to aryepiglottic folds 
false vocal cords paraglottic fat 
hyoid bone 
thyroid cartilage laryngeal ventricle thyroarytenoid and vocalis muscles vocal ligament cricoid cartilage 
• 
The larynx connects the oropharynx airway to the tracheal airway. 

• 
The cartilaginous components of the larynx include the epiglottis, thyroid cartilage, cricoid 


cartilage, and arytenoids. The cricoid cartilage is a complete ring which provides the foundation for the laryngeal skeleton. 
• The entire larynx, including the epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds and false vocal cords, is lined with mucosa. 
The aryepiglottic folds are an extension of the mucosa covering the epiglottis and mark the entrance to 
the larynx. The aryepiglottic folds connect the epiglottis anteriorly to the arytenoids posteriorly. The false vocal folds are mucosal infoldings superior to the laryngeal ventricle. They can be identified on cross-sectional imaging by the presence of the paraglottic fat laterally. 
• 
The supraglottic larynx extends from the epiglottis to the ventricle. The false vocal cords, the aryepiglottic folds, the suprahyoid epiglottis, infrahyoid epiglottis, and the arytenoid cartilages are within the supraglottis and considered subsites for the purposes of staging SCC as discussed below. 

• 
The glottis includes the true vocal cords, the anterior and posterior commissures, and 


extends 1 cm below the vocal cords. The thyroarytenoid muscle, vocalis muscle, and the innermost vocal ligament form the bulk of the vocal cords. The true vocal cords are identified in the axial plane by CT or MRI by identifying the transition of paraglottic fat to muscle (thyroarytenoid muscle) within the wall of the larynx. 
• The subglottic larynx begins 1 cm inferior to the apex of the laryngeal ventricles and extends to the first tracheal ring. The cricoid cartilaginous ring is within the subglottic larynx. 

Vocal cord paralysis 
• Vocal cord paralysis is most commonly due to iatrogenic trauma from neck surgery, but may be secondary to a mass along the course of the vagus or recurrent laryngeal nerves. Other conditions include stroke, infection, laryngeal neoplasm, MS and neuro-degenerative 
disease. 
• The most common mass to cause left vocal cord paralysis is a mediastinal or thoracic mass; however, enlargement of the left atrium or pulmonary arteries may cause cardiovocal 
syndrome due to recurrent laryngeal nerve compression. 
• 
The CT imaging of vocal cord paralysis shows a thickened, medialized aryepiglottic fold and enlargement of the piriform sinus on the affected side. 

• 
The left recurrent laryngeal nerve is the most commonly affected nerve. Imaging for vocal cord paralysis should extend from the skull base to the level of the left pulmonary artery to cover the full course of the vagus and the left recurrent laryngeal nerves. 

• 
The recurrent laryngeal nerve innervates all laryngeal musculature except the cricothyroid 


muscle, which is innervated by the superior laryngeal nerve. 
Laryngocele 
• 
A laryngocele is a dilation of the laryngeal ventricle, which may be caused by high laryngeal pressures. Trumpet players, glassblowers, and patients with COPD have increased risk of developing a laryngocele. A laryngocele may be filled with air or fluid. 

• 
An important differential consideration is ventricular obstruction by neoplasm (most commonly squamous cell carcinoma), which typically causes a fluid-filled laryngocele. 


Laryngeal SCC 

Supraglottic SCC: Axial noncontrast CT through the neck (left image) in a patient presenting with hoarseness demonstrates nodular thickening of the right false cord (yellow arrow) effacing the paraglottic fat. Subsequent F-18 FDG PET shows uptake correlating to this nodule (yellow arrow) as well as uptake in a right level III lymph node (red arrows) concerning for metastatic involvement. 
• Laryngeal SCC is the most common laryngeal malignancy. 
Less common tumors of the larynx (such as lymphoma and chondrosarcoma) are submucosal and therefore not visible on laryngoscopic exam. 
• 
The majority of laryngeal SCC arise from the glottis. 

• 
There are three staging schemes for laryngeal SCC, specific to the supraglottic, glottic, and subglottic subsites. 


• Staging of the supraglottic SCC is dependent on the number of subsites of the supraglottis that are described (listed above), vocal cord mobility, and involvement of adjacent structures. 

Laryngeal SCC (continued) 
Treatment of supraglottic SCC can vary from laser epiglottectomy, various types of supraglottic 
laryngectomy to total laryngectomy. Involvement of several key structures guides surgical management 
including the laryngeal ventricle, thyroid cartilaginous invasion, posterior cricoid, or anterior commissure invasion, involvement of bilateral arytenoid cartilage, which are contraindications to supraglottic 
laryngectomy. 
Other areas which have relevance in staging include the paraglottic space, the inner cortex of the thyroid cartilage, involvement of the prevertebral space, encasement of the carotid artery or involvement of mediastinal structures. 
Local spread to the paraglottic spread is particularly relevant in supraglottic tumors. 
• Staging of glottic SCC is also dependent on vocal cord mobility, cartilaginous involvement,  
and extension to relevant structures described above. Patients with SCC of the glottis present early because of voice changes. Key consideration for staging glottic SCC is evaluation for contralateral involvement, since this precludes 
sparing of the contralateral side as well as the degree of vertical involvement. Transglottic tumors, which cross the laryngeal ventricle to involve both the false and true vocal cords, 
portend a worse prognosis. 
• Subglottic SCC constitutes less than 5% of laryngeal carcinomas. These lesions can be difficult to identify endoscopically given obscuration from apposed true cords. Staging is similar to the supraglottic and glottic types described above. Prognosis for subglottic lesions 
is poor as they present at a much more extensive stage. 
Laryngeal hemangiomas 
• Laryngeal hemangiomas occur most commonly in the subglottic larynx in infants. These are frequently associated with cutaneous lesions. They frequently regress in infants, however 
given risk of airway compromise can be treated with laser therapy. 
• Laryngeal hemangiomas in adults are very rare, with only case reports in the literature. These do not regress spontaneously and are surgically treated. 
Laryngeal trauma 
• Blunt trauma to the neck may compress the larynx against the cervical spine, 
with injury to the posterior soft tissues 
due to the sandwich effect. 
• 
Fractures of the thyroid and cricoid cartilage may be difficult to detect in young patients with incomplete ossification. 

• 
Iatrogenic trauma from intubation can cause arytenoid cartilage dislocation. 





Other malignant neoplasms of the mucosal spaces 
Lymphoma 
• Lymphoma can arise from the adenoids of the nasopharynx. Most frequently this is non­Hodgkin’s lymphoma and affects a younger population. 

Sarcomas 
• Any type of sarcoma can be found in the larynx, including synovial sarcomas, chondrosarcomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, and liposarcomas. Chondrosarcomas are generally centered in either the cricoid or thyroid cartilage and have characteristic popcorn-like calcifications that are best seen on CT.
