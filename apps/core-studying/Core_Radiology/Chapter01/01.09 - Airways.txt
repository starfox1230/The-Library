Airways 
Multifocal or diffuse non-neoplastic tracheal stenosis/wall thic.ening 

Relapsing polychondritis 
• Relapsing polychondritis is a multisystemic disease of unknown etiology characterized by recurrent inflammation of cartilaginous structures. The nose, ear, joints, larynx, trachea, and bronchi can be affected, with airway involvement seen in 50% of patients. 
The larynx and subglottic trachea are the most common sites of airway involvement. 
• 
Relapsing polychondritis usually occurs in middle-aged women. 

• 
On cross-sectional imaging, there is smooth tracheal/bronchial wall thickening, with sparing 


of the posterior membranous trachea. The tracheal cartilage is an incomplete ring, with no cartilage in the posterior membranous portion. 
• There is often increased attenuation of the airway wall, ranging from subtly increased attenuation to frank calcification. Tracheomalacia (expiratory collapse of the trachea) is commonly present. 
Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica (TPO) 
• Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica (TPO) is a benign condition of multiple submucosal osteocartilaginous nodules along the tracheal walls that appear as coarse calcifications, with sparing of the posterior membranous trachea. 

Tracheal tuberculosis: Axial CT in soft-tissue window through the upper trachea (left image) shows circumferential tracheal thickening (arrows). Coronal curved-multiplanar reformation (right image) shows multifocal tracheal stenosis (arrows) and left mainstem bronchus stenosis. These images were obtained approximately one month after treatment for active post-primary TB.

• 
Airway involvement by TB occurs in a prominent minority of patients with pulmonary TB, most commonly involving the distal trachea and proximal bronchi. 

• 
Imaging findings are nonspecific. There is usually smooth concentric narrowing of a relatively long airway segment (typically >3 cm). 


Amyloidosis 


Tracheal amyloid: Axial CT images show nodular and irregular thickening of the trachea (arrows). This pattern is not specific, and the differential diagnosis would also include sarcoidosis, multifocal adenoid cystic carcinoma, and tracheal metastases.

• 
Amyloidosis causes irregular narrowing of the airways due to submucosal amyloid deposition, which may be calcified. Involvement may be mass-like or segmental. Tracheal amyloidosis is very rare. 

• 
The posterior membranous trachea is not spared. 

• 
Large airway involvement is seen in approximately 20% of patients with GPA, most commonly manifesting as subglottic tracheal stenosis with circumferential mucosal thickening. 

• 
The posterior membranous trachea is not spared. Calcifications are not seen. 


Sarcoidosis 
• 
Tracheal involvement by sarcoid is rare and usually seen in advanced disease. Tracheal sarcoid has a variable appearance ranging from smooth stenosis to a nodular or mass-like appearance. 

• 
The posterior membranous trachea is not spared. 





Large airways 
Bronchiectasis 
• 
Bronchiectasis is progressive, irreversible dilation of cartilage-containing bronchi. 

• 
Three etiologies of bronchiectasis have been described, with a final common pathway of mucus plugging, superimposed bacterial colonization, and inflammatory response. 


Bronchial wall injury, typically from infection or inflammation. Bronchial lumen obstruction. Traction from adjacent fibrosis. 
• Morphologic classification of bronchiectasis is most useful as a rough gauge of severity. 
Cylindrical bronchiectasis (least severe): Mild bronchial dilation. Varicose bronchiectasis (moderately severe): Bronchi may become beaded and irregular. Cystic bronchiectasis (most severe): Bronchi are markedly enlarged and ballooned. 
• 
Radiographic findings depend on severity. In mild cases only tram tracks may be visible, representing thickened bronchial walls causing parallel radiopaque lines resembling tram tracks. In more severe cases there can be extensive cystic change. 

• 
CT findings include the signet ring sign, which describes a dilated bronchus adjacent to a 


normal pulmonary artery branch. Normally each bronchus should be approximately the same size as the adjacent pulmonary artery branch. Other CT findings of bronchiectasis include lack of bronchial tapering, bronchial wall thickening, and 
mucus-filled bronchi. Often, adjacent tree-in-bud nodules are present, likely representing associated small-airways infection. 
• 
Traction bronchiectasis occurs secondary to lung fibrosis (see earlier discussion of ILD). 

• 
Patterns of primary bronchiectasis can be divided into lung zones and central to peripheral distribution: 


Upper lung: cystic fibrosis, ABPA. Mid lung: atypical mycobacteria. Lower lung: chronic aspiration, post-infectious, immotile cilia, immunodeficiency. 
Central: ABPA, Mounier-Kuhn (tracheobronchomegaly). Mid-order bronchi: Williams-Campbell (fourth to sixth order bronchi). 
• Chronic aspiration is the most common cause of bronchiectasis. 

Bronchiectasis from chronic aspiration: Axial and coronal CT show bronchial wall thickening in the bilateral lower lobes due to dependent aspiration (arrows). 
• Bronchocentric infections, such as tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria. 

Bronchiectasis of the right middle lobe and lingula (arrows) due to 
Mycobacterium avium intracellulare 
infection. 
• Ineffective clearing of secretions – cystic fibrosis and Kartagener (primary ciliary dyskinesia). 

Bronchiectasis from cystic fibrosis with superimposed pneumonia: Radiograph shows upper-lobe bronchiectasis with a focal left upper lobe opacity (yellow arrow). CT confirms bronchiectasis (red arrows) and a left upper lobe consolidation (yellow arrow), representing pneumonia. 
• Congenital connective tissue disorders – Mounier-Kuhn (a connective tissue disorder causing tracheobronchomegaly leading to recurrent pneumonia), or Williams-Campbell (a rare disorder of the fourth to sixth mid-order bronchial cartilage, which may be congenital or acquired as a sequela of viral infection). 

Mounier-Kuhn: Chest radiograph (left image) shows severe diffuse bronchiectasis. CT shows tracheal dilation (calipers) up to 3 cm and severe cystic bronchiectasis. 
• 
Broncholithiasis is a rare disorder of calcified/ossified material within the bronchial lumen, caused by erosion of an adjacent calcified granulomatous lymph node. 

• 
Broncholithiasis clinically presents with nonproductive cough, hemoptysis, and air trapping. 




Focal non-neoplastic tracheal stenosis/wall thic.ening 
Intubation/tracheostomy 
• There is approximately 1% risk of tracheal stenosis after intubation, but approximately 30% risk of stenosis after long-standing tracheostomy. 

Rare causes of focal tracheal stenosis 
• Extremely uncommon causes of focal tracheal stenosis include Behçet and Crohn disease. 


Airway tumors 
• 
Primary tumors of the trachea and central bronchi are rare. In adults, the vast majority of tumors are malignant, while in children most are benign. 

• 
Squamous cell carcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma are by far the two most common primary central airway tumors in adults. 


Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) 

Endotracheal squamous cell carcinoma: Radiograph shows a tracheal luminal narrowing (arrow) at the level of the thoracic inlet. On CT there is an eccentric enhancing mass invading the left tracheal wall and markedly narrowing the tracheal lumen (arrow). 
• 
Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common primary tracheal malignancy. It is strongly associated with cigarette smoking. 

• 
The typical CT appearance of tracheal squamous cell carcinoma is a polypoid intraluminal mass. The contours of the mass can be irregular, smooth, or lobulated. The tumor can occasionally invade into the esophagus, causing tracheoesophageal fistula. 



Tracheal adenoid cystic carcinoma: CT (left image) shows irregular circumferential tracheal thickening (arrow). Post-contrast coronal T1-weighted MRI (right image) shows an enhancing nodular mass extending into the tracheal lumen (arrows). Case courtesy Ritu R. Gill, MD, MPH, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a relatively low grade malignancy that usually affects patients in their forties, a decade or two younger than the typical SCC patient. It is not associated with cigarette smoking. 

• 
ACC has a propensity for perineural and submucosal spread. It may spread over a long segment of the trachea, complicating the ability to resect the lesion. 

• 
The typical CT appearance of ACC is a submucosal mass that infiltrates the tracheal wall and surrounding mediastinal fat. ACC may also present as circumferential tracheal or bronchial thickening causing airway stenosis. 


Carcinoid 

Endobronchial carcinoid: Chest radiograph shows right lower lobe atelectasis (arrows) and volume loss. Axial contrast-enhanced CT shows a mildly enhancing well-circumscribed endobronchial mass (arrow) in the right mainstem bronchus just distal to the carina. 
• 
Carcinoid almost always occurs distal to the carina. 

• 
CT shows an endoluminal bronchial mass that may calcify and often enhances avidly. Note that carcinoid tumors tend to have a larger extrinsic component than endobronchial component. 


In addition to carcinoid, the differential diagnosis of an enhancing endobronchial mass includes mucoepidermoid carcinoma and very rare entities such as hemangioma and glomus tumor. 
• 
Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a rare tumor that originates from tiny salivary glands lining the tracheobronchial tree. 

• 
Mucoepidermoid carcinoma tends to affect younger patients than adenoid cystic carcinoma. 

• 
CT appearance is a round or oval endobronchial mass, indistinguishable from carcinoid. 


Tracheal lymphoma 
• Tracheal lymphoma is rare. It is usually associated with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), a low-grade malignancy. 
Endobronchial metastasis 

Endobronchial metastasis: 
Coronal contrast-enhanced CT demonstrates a heterogeneously enhancing mass, which invades the right mainstem bronchus (arrows). This was a spindle-cell carcinoma, but the imaging appearance is nonspecific. 
• 
Breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, thyroid cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, and sarcoma are the most common malignancies to metastasize to the central airways. 

• 
The mnemonic BReTh Lung may be helpful to remember the four most common airway metastases (breast, renal cell, thyroid, and lung). 


Direct invasion of the central airways by adjacent malignancy 
• Direct central airway invasion occurs more commonly than endobronchial metastases. Aggressive laryngeal, thyroid, esophageal, and lung cancer may cause direct airway invasion. 
Benign endobronchial lesions 
• Papilloma is a benign but potentially pre-malignant lesion that may transform into 
carcinoma. Suspected papillomas are typically closely followed. 
A single papilloma is usually caused by chronic irritation. 
Multiple papillomas (laryngotracheal papillomatosis) is caused by HPV, which may be acquired at birth. 
Distribution is usually centered in the larynx, with tracheobronchial involvement in 1–5% of cases. Papillomas may spread to the lungs, where they will form multiple cavitary nodules with dependent distribution. 
• 
Chondroma is a benign cartilaginous tumor that rarely may occur in the airways. 

• 
Other benign endobronchial lesions include schwannoma, adenoma, hamartoma, hemangioma, lipoma, and leiomyoma. 



Emphysema 
• 
Emphysema is the destruction of alveolar walls resulting in irreversible enlargement of the distal airspaces. 

• 
Elastase is produced by alveolar macrophages and neutrophils, both of which are increased in smokers. Elastase is a powerful destructive enzyme which functions in the host defense mechanism, but excess elastase can be highly harmful to the native tissues. Alpha-1­antitrypsin normally neutralizes elastase. Either a surplus of elastase (in smoking-related emphysema) or insufficient neutralizing enzyme (in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency) can cause lung destruction and resultant emphysema. 


Centrilobular emphysema 

Centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema: Coronal (left image) and axial CT demonstrates both centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema. Centrilobular emphysema is predominant in the upper lobes (yellow arrows) and paraseptal emphysema is seen anteromedially (blue arrows). 
• 
Centrilobular emphysema is a smoking-related lung disease. 

• 
Centrilobular emphysema predominantly affects the upper lobes. Like RB-ILD, another smoking-related lung disease, centrilobular emphysema primarily affects the center of the secondary pulmonary lobule. 


All smoking-related lung disease (RB, RB-ILD, DIP, PLCH, and emphysema) may be within the same spectrum of disease caused by macrophage-mediated inflammation in reaction to inhaled particles and toxins. 
Paraseptal emphysema 
• 
Paraseptal emphysema is usually seen in combination with other forms of emphysema. It is also usually smoking related. 

• 
Paraseptal emphysema is subpleural in location and may predispose to pneumothorax. 

• 
Panacinar (also called panlobular) emphysema affects the entire acinus diffusely throughout the lung. The emphysematous changes are usually more severe at the lung bases. 

• 
Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the main cause of panacinar emphysema. 



Panacinar emphysema due to alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency: Frontal radiograph and coronal CT show diffuse emphysematous changes most severely affecting the lower lobes, with flattening of the diaphragms (arrows).
