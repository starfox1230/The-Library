Mediastinum 
Anatomy of the mediastinum 

• 
Several methods have been proposed to divide the mediastinum. This text follows the International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group (ITMIG) method that has been accepted as a new standard. 

• 
The mediastinum is divided into three arbitrary compartments to aid in the differential diagnosis of a mediastinal mass. However, there are no anatomic planes separating these divisions and disease can spread from one “compartment” to another. 

• 
The three divisions are used to aid in the differential diagnosis of a mass and planning for biopsies and surgical procedures. 


Prevascular compartment 
• 
The prevascular compartment is bordered by (a) superiorly, the thoracic inlet; (b) inferiorly, the diaphragm; (c) anteriorly, the posterior border/cortex of the sternum; (d) laterally, the parietal mediastinal pleura; and (e) posteriorly, the anterior aspect of the pericardium. 

• 
Essentially, it contains the thymus/thymic remnant. 


Visceral compartment 
• 
The boundaries include (a) superiorly, the thoracic inlet; (b) inferiorly, the diaphragm; (c) anteriorly, the posterior boundaries of the prevascular compartment; and (d) posteriorly, a vertical line connecting the thoracic vertebral bodies 1 cm posterior to its anterior margin. 

• 
Essentially, it contains the heart, great vessels, trachea, and esophagus. Most lymph nodes are located in the middle mediastinum. 

• 
The phrenic, vagus, and recurrent laryngeal nerves pass through the AP window within the visceral compartment. 


Paravertebral compartment 
• The anterior boundary of the paravertebral compartment is 1 cm posterior to the anterior vertebral body and the posterior boundary is a vertical line along the posterior margin of the chest wall at the lateral aspect of the transverse processes. 
Lines, stripes, and interfaces 
• Interfaces between anatomic structures in the lungs, mediastinum, and pleura may be 
displaced or thickened in the presence of a mediastinal mass or abnormality. A “line” is a thin interface formed by tissue (typically <1 mm in thickness) with air on both sides. A “stripe” is a thicker interface formed between air and adjacent soft tissue. 
An “interface” is formed by the contact of two soft tissue structures of different densities. 
posterior junction line 
right paratracheal stripe 
anterior junction line 
azygoesophageal recess 
right paraspinal line 

• The anterior junction line is formed by 4 layers of pleura (parietal and visceral pleura of each lung) at the anterior junction of the right and left lungs. 
On a frontal radiograph, the anterior junction line is a vertical line projecting over the superior two-thirds of the sternum. Abnormal convexity or displacement of this line suggests a prevascular mediastinal mass. 
• The posterior junction line is also formed by 4 layers of pleura (parietal and visceral pleura of each lung), but at the posterior junction of the right and left lungs. On a frontal radiograph, the posterior junction line is a vertical line projecting through the trachea on the frontal view, more superior than the anterior junction line. Unlike the anterior junction line, the posterior 
junction line is seen above the clavicles because the posterior lungs extend more superiorly than the anterior lungs. It is much less commonly seen than the anterior junction line. Abnormal convexity or displacement of this line suggests a paravertebral mediastinal mass or aortic 
aneurysm. 

Lines, stripes, and interfaces (continued) 
• The right and left paratracheal stripes are formed by two layers of pleura where the medial aspect of each lung abuts the lateral wall of the trachea and intervening mediastinal fat. 
The right paratracheal stripe is the most commonly seen of these landmarks, seen in up to 97% of normal PA chest radiographs. Thickening of the right paratracheal stripe is most commonly due to a paratracheal mass (including 
adenopathy or thyroid or tracheal neoplasm). 
Thickening of the left paratracheal stripe has a similar differential. Note that the normal left subclavian reflection is a less dense stripe on the left of the trachea. Mediastinal hematoma should be considered in the setting of trauma. 
• 
The posterior tracheal stripe or tracheoesophageal stripe is the only interface seen on the lateral radiograph, representing the interface of the posterior wall of the trachea with the two pleural layers of the medial right lung. 

• 
The right and left paraspinal lines are actually interfaces but appear as lines due to Mach effect and are formed by two layers of pleura abutting the posterior chest wall. 


In contrast to the posterior junction line, the paraspinal lines are located inferiorly in the thorax, typically from the eighth through twelfth ribs. A paraspinal line abnormality suggests a paravertebral mediastinal mass, including hematoma, neurogenic 
tumor, aortic aneurysm, extramedullary hematopoiesis, esophageal mass, and osteophyte. 
• The azygoesophageal recess is an interface formed by the contact of the posteromedial 
right lower lobe and the retrocardiac mediastinum. The azygoesophageal recess extends from the subcarinal region to the diaphragm inferiorly. Distortion of the azygoesophageal recess may be due to esophageal mass, hiatal hernia, left atrial 
enlargement, and adenopathy. 

Aortopulmomary (AP) window 
• 
The aortopulmonary (AP) window is a mediastinal space nestled underneath the aortic arch (which forms the superior, anterior, and posterior boundaries) and the top of the pulmonary artery. The medial border of the AP window is formed by the esophagus, trachea, and left mainstem bronchus. 

• 
On a normal frontal radiograph, the AP window is a shallow concave contour below the aortic knob and above the pulmonary artery. 

• 
Abnormal convexity (outwards bulging) of the AP window suggests a mass arising from or involving structures that normally live within the AP window, including: 


Lymph nodes: Adenopathy is the most common cause of an AP window abnormality. Left phrenic nerve: Injury may cause paralysis of the left hemidiaphragm. Recurrent laryngeal nerve: The AP window should be carefully evaluated in new-onset hoarseness, 
especially if associated with diaphragmatic paralysis. Left vagus nerve. Ligamentum arteriosum. Left bronchial arteries. Aortic aneurysm or traumatic injury of the aorta. 

Retrosternal clear space 
• 
The retrosternal clear space is a normal area of lucency posterior to the sternum seen on the lateral radiograph. It correlates with the prevascular space on CT. 

• 
Obliteration of the retrosternal clear space suggests a prevascular mediastinal mass, right ventricular dilation, or pulmonary artery enlargement. 

• 
Increase in the retrosternal clear space can be seen in emphysema. 



Left superior intercostal vein (LSIV) 
• 
The left superior intercostal vein (LSIV) is a normal vein that is not often seen on radiography. When visible, the LSIV produces the aortic nipple, appearing as a small round shadow to the left of the aortic knob on the frontal radiograph. 

• 
The LSIV may be dilated as a collateral pathway in SVC obstruction. 




Radiographic localization of a mediastinal mass 
Detection of an anterior mediastinal mass 
• 
Deformation of the anterior junction line suggests a prevascular mediastinal mass. However, since the anterior junction line is not always seen, it is more common to infer the anterior location of a mass by preservation of the posterior lines in the presence of a mass. 

• 
The hilum overlay sign is present on the frontal view if hilar vessels are visualized through the mass. It indicates that the mass cannot be in the visceral mediastinum. The mass may be anterior (more likely) or posterior. 



Anterior mediastinal mass: Frontal radiograph shows a right mediastinal mass with silhouetting of the right heart border. The right pulmonary artery is visible through the mass (arrows), representing the hilum overlay sign and indicating that the mass is not in the middle mediastinum. Lateral radiograph shows the mass in the retrosternal clear space, confirming its anterior mediastinal location. This was a teratoma. 
• Obliteration of the retrosternal clear space on the lateral radiograph is direct sign of prevascular mediastinal location. 

Detection of a middle mediastinal mass 
• Distortion of the azygoesophageal recess, distortion of the posterior junction line, paratracheal stripes, or convexity of the AP window suggests a visceral compartment mediastinal mass. 

Displacement of the descending aortic stripe: Frontal chest radiograph (left) shows lateral displacement and bowing of the left para-aortic interface (arrows). Axial contrast-enhanced CT shows a nonenhancing homogeneous mass (arrow) effacing the esophagus. Although extremely rare, this was a liposarcoma. 
Detection of a posterior mediastinal mass 
• Distortion or displacement of the paraspinal lines suggests paravertebral disease. Chest: 73 


prevascular compartment mediastinal mass 
Overview of prevascular mediastinal masses 
• The differential diagnosis for a prevascular mediastinal mass includes: 
Thymoma 
Thymic epithelial neoplasm, such as thymoma if the patient is middle aged or older, or has a history of myasthenia gravis. Less common would be thymic carcinoma. Germ cell tumor, including teratoma, if the patient is a young adult. Lymphoma. Thyroid goiter, only rarely in the anterior mediastinum. 

Invasive thymoma with drop metastasis: Contrast-enhanced CT shows a slightly heterogeneous mass with calcifications (yellow arrow) anterior to the aorta and SVC, with two pleural metastases (red arrows).

• 
Thymoma is the most common primary tumor of the anterior mediastinum and typically occurs in middle-aged or older individuals, between 35 and 60 years. 

• 
Thymoma is associated with myasthenia gravis (MG). Approximately 33% of patients with thymoma have MG, and 10% of patients with MG have a thymoma. 

• 
In addition to MG, thymomas are associated with other diseases including red cell aplasia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and other paraneoplastic syndromes. 

• 
Thymoma can be pathologically classified as low-risk or high-risk based on histology, and non-invasive or invasive based on whether the capsule is intact. 


Approximately 30% of thymomas are invasive. If invasive, the tumor may invade adjacent structures including the airways, chest wall, great vessels, and phrenic nerves. Elevation of a hemidiaphragm is suggestive of phrenic nerve invasion. 
• 
Thymomas are generally lobulated masses in the anterior mediastinum, often off-center. They may calcify or develop necrosis. 

• 
Drop metastases from invasive thymoma spread along pleural and pericardial surfaces. 

• 
Hematogenous metastases are uncommon given that thymomas tend to be indolent tumors with local recurrence. 



Less common thymic lesions 
• Thymic carcinoma 
Unlike thymoma, thymic carcinoma is histologically malignant, very aggressive, and often metastasizes hematogenously to lungs, liver, brain, and bone. Prognosis is poor. Distinction between invasive thymoma and thymic carcinoma is difficult by imaging alone. 
• Thymic cyst 
A thymic cyst may be secondary to radiation therapy (e.g., administered to treat Hodgkin disease), associated with AIDS or Sjögren’s syndrome (especially when multilocular), or congenital arising from remnants of the thymopharyngeal duct. A congenital thymic cyst may occur anywhere along the course of thymic descent from the neck, but most commonly in the prevascular mediastinum. 
CT shows a simple fluid-attenuation cyst in the prevascular mediastinum, typically centrally located. It may measure greater than simple fluid if it contains proteinaceous or hemorrhagic contents. Cystic nature can be confirmed with MRI. 
• Thymolipoma 
Thymolipoma is a benign fat-containing lesion with interspersed soft tissue. It may become quite large and drape over the mediastinum. 
• Thymic hyperplasia 
Thymic hyperplasia appears as diffuse symmetric gland enlargement without focal mass. 
True thymic hyperplasia is a reaction to systemic stressors such as radiation therapy, burns, chemotherapy, and steroids. Lymphoid hyperplasia is associated with myasthenia gravis, SLE, RA, scleroderma, and Grave’s disease. 
Germ cell tumor (GCT) 
• 
Several different types of GCTs may arise in the prevascular mediastinum from primitive germ cell elements. 

• 
Teratoma is the most common mediastinal germ cell tumor, usually encapsulated and  often predominantly cystic in nature, but fat and calcification are common. A fat/fluid level is specific for teratoma, but is not commonly seen. Teratoma can rarely be malignant, especially if there is a large soft tissue component. 



Teratoma: Chest radiograph shows an extra mediastinal contour (yellow arrow) lateral to the aortic arch (red arrow). Because the mass does not silhouette the aorta it cannot be in the middle mediastinum. On CT there is a mediastinal mass containing a large focus of fat (yellow arrow) likely representing a benign teratoma. 
Case courtesy Ritu R. Gill, MD, MPH, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Seminoma is the most common malignant prevascular mediastinal germ cell tumor. It occurs almost exclusively in men 10 to 39 years old. Pleural effusions are rare but pulmonary metastases are relatively common. 

• 
Malignant GCT occurs almost exclusively in males. There is a higher incidence of mediastinal 


GCT in Klinefelter syndrome. 

Malignant germ cell tumor with mixed pathology: 
Chest radiograph (top left) in a 39-year-old male shows a large soft tissue mass overlying the upper mediastinum. Coronal CT chest image (top right) shows a large heterogeneous mass in the visceral compartment with low density components (blue arrow). Axial CT image (bottom right) demonstrates calcification (yellow arrow) and gynecomastia bilaterally (red arrow). Pathology showed mixed components of teratoma, high grade sarcoma, and leiomyosarcomatous differentiation. 


Lymphoma 
• 
Both Hodgkin disease and non-Hodgkin lymphoma are important differential considerations for an anterior mediastinal mass. 

• 
Lymphoma often presents as an aggressive, invasive mass. There is usually associated mediastinal lymphadenopathy which can be in the prevascular or visceral compartments. In particular, internal mammary lymphadenopathy is very highly associated with mediastinal lymphomas. 

• 
Calcification is rare in untreated lymphoma but common after treatment. 





Visceral compartment mediastinal mass 
Adenopathy 
• 
Lymphadenopathy is an important cause of a middle mediastinal mass on radiography, etiologies of which include malignant and non-malignant causes. 

• 
Lymph node calcification, low attenuation, and avid enhancement are unusual features for lymphoma. An alternative diagnosis should be considered if these imaging findings are seen. 

• 
Eggshell calcification of lymph nodes is often present in silicosis and coal worker’s pneumoconiosis, less commonly in sarcoidosis. Given the greater prevalence of sarcoidosis, however, eggshell calcification may be seen more commonly in sarcoid overall. 

• 
Dense calcification within a lymph node can be seen in sarcoidosis or as a sequela of prior granulomatous disease. 

• 
Low attenuation lymph nodes, while nonspecific, should raise concern for active TB. Low attenuation lymph nodes can also be seen in fungal infection such as histoplasmosis, lymphoma, and metastatic disease. 

• 
Hemorrhagic high-attenuation lymph nodes can be seen in anthrax inhalation as part of hemorrhagic lymphadenitis and mediastinitis. 

• 
Avid lymph node enhancement can be seen in Castleman disease, sarcoidosis, TB, and vascular metastases. Avidly enhancing metastases include: 



Castleman disease 
• 
Castleman disease, also known as angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia, is a cause of highly vascular thoracic lymph node enlargement. The key imaging feature is avidly enhancing lymph nodes. 

• 
Unicentric Castleman disease is seen as a single enlarged lymph node in children or young adults. Surgical resection is usually curative. 

• 
Multicentric Castleman disease is almost always seen in patients with AIDS associated with HHV8. Multicentric disease often results in systemic illness including fever, anemia, and lymphoma. It is typically treated with chemotherapy. 


Epicardial fat pad 

Epicardial fat infarct: Radiograph shows hazy opacity overlying the left heart border (arrow). Axial CT image shows fat stranding and edema of the left epicardial fat pad in keeping with infarct. 
• A prominent epicardial fat pad silhouettes the cardiac border on a frontal radiograph and may simulate cardiomegaly. 

Pericardial cyst 
• 
A pericardial cyst is a benign cystic lesion thought to be congenital. Most are located at the right cardiophrenic angle (between the heart and the diaphragm). 

• 
Imaging shows a cystic lesion abutting the pericardium, which may change in shape on subsequent studies. 



Cardiac masses 
• 
Cardiac masses can be intracavitary, valvular, intramural, or epicardial/pericardial. 

• 
Composition of the mass, behavior at the margins, and enhancement characteristics are important diagnostic imaging features, as further discussed in the Cardiac chapter. 


Thyroid lesion 


Inferior extension of a goiter into the mediastinum: 
Chest radiograph demonstrates a right superior mediastinal mass (arrow) with obscuration of the superior border of the mass, representing the cervicothoracic sign, which implies that the mass is in continuity with the soft tissues of the neck. 
Noncontrast CT shows a large heterogeneous mass (arrows) with coarse calcifications replacing the thyroid gland. 
Although the thyroid is anterior, the goiter extends inferiorly into the middle mediastinum due to an embryologic fascial plane created by the inferior thyroidal artery. 
Case courtesy Ritu R. Gill, MD, MPH, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Benign and malignant thyroid masses may extend into the mediastinum, including goiter, thyroid neoplasm, and an enlarged gland due to thyroiditis. 

• 
The key to diagnosis is to show continuity superiorly with the thyroid. 


Ascending aortic, aortic arch, or descending aortic aneurysm 
• An abnormality of the ascending aorta or aortic arch may appear as a mediastinal mass on radiography. 


Enlarged pulmonary artery (PA) 
• An enlarged pulmonary artery (PA) can simulate a mass on a chest radiograph. As previously discussed, the hilum convergence sign can help distinguish between an enlarged PA and a mediastinal mass. The hilum convergence sign shows the peripheral pulmonary arteries converging into the “mass” if the mass represents an enlarged pulmonary artery. 
Hiatal hernia 

Hiatal hernia: Frontal radiograph shows a retrocardiac lucency (arrows), which was confirmed to be a moderate-sized hiatal hernia on CT (arrows). 
• 
A hiatal hernia is protrusion of a portion of the stomach through the esophageal hiatus. The esophageal hiatus is an elliptical opening in the diaphragm just to the left of midline. 

• 
On radiography, air or an air-fluid level is often present above the diaphragm. 


Morgagni hernia 
• 
Morgagni hernia is a diaphragmatic hernia through the foramen of Morgagni that occurs anteriorly where the two hemidiaphragms meet, containing omental fat and often bowel. The contents of a Morgagni hernia typically fall to the right. 

• 
An anterior mediastinal mass in contact with the diaphragm containing bowel gas is diagnostic for a Morgagni hernia. 

• 
If bowel gas is absent, a key to diagnosis on CT is the detection of omental vessels in the mass that can be traced into the upper abdomen. 


Esophageal neoplasm 
• 
A focal esophageal lesion is concerning for adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Esophageal carcinoma can present on radiography as abnormal convexity of the azygoesophageal recess, mediastinal widening, or a retrotracheal mass. 

• 
Benign mesenchymal esophageal tumors include fibrovascular polyp, leiomyoma, fibroma, or lipoma. 



Foregut duplication cyst 
• Foregut duplication cysts include bronchogenic cysts, esophageal duplication cysts, and neurenteric cysts. Although often low attenuation, internal heterogeneity can be due to hemorrhagic or proteinaceous components or superinfection. Bronchogenic cysts can arise from any mediastinal compartment, but they most commonly arise near the carina in the visceral compartment (typically in right paratracheal space, subcarinal space, or hila). The lesion’s thin walls may enhance or have intrinsic calcifications. 
Esophageal duplication cysts are adjacent to the esophagus. 

Bronchogenic cyst: Frontal radiograph shows a subtle opacity overlying the right heart (arrows), shown to be a fluid attenuation lesion adjacent to the esophagus on CT. 
Case courtesy Darryl Sneag, MD, Brigham and Women's Hospital. 
Paraganglioma 
• 
Cardiac or aortopulmonary paragangliomas can present as a visceral compartment mediastinal mass, arising from phrenic, vagus, and recurrent laryngeal nerves. 

• 
A paraganglioma or extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma is a highly vascular neuroendocrine tumor that originates from embryonic neural crest cells of the peripheral nervous system. It can be sympathetic or parasympathetic. A visceral compartment mediastinal paraganglioma tends to be parasympathetic in origin. 

• 
Malignancy can occur in up to 10% of extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas. They can be functioning or non-functioning. 

• 
CT appearance is of a hypervascular mass with robust feeding arteries. There may be internal heterogeneity representing necrosis. 

• 
MRI shows a T1 intermediate, T2 hyperintense mass with homogeneous enhancement. 



Contrast enhanced axial CT shows a hypervascular mediastinal mass (yellow arrow) with central areas of necrosis (red arrow) directly abutting the borders of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta just above the level of the pulmonary veins, consistent with a parasympathetic paraganglioma. 


Paravertebral compartment mediastinal mass 
Neurogenic tumor 
• 
A neurogenic tumor may arise from either a peripheral nerve or the sympathetic ganglia. Most adult tumors are peripheral nerve sheath tumors and the vast majority of tumors in children are of sympathetic ganglionic origin. Overall, neurogenic tumors are the most common paravertebral compartment mediastinal masses. 

• 
Imaging features typically show a smooth round mass. Benign pressure erosion of adjacent ribs, vertebrae, and enlargement of neuroforamina may occur. 

• 
Interval growth of a neurogenic tumor with regions of internal heterogeneity should raise concern for transformation to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. 

• 
Peripheral nerve tumors (more common in adults) include: 


Schwannoma (most common), neurofibroma, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. 

Frontal radiograph Lateral radiograph 

Axial CT with contrast Axial T2-weighted MRI Schwannoma: Frontal radiograph shows a round opacity overlying the right hilum with the hilum overlay sign (arrow) corresponding to a paravertebral abnormality on lateral radiograph. CT shows a low density lesion without significant enhancement. MRI shows heterogeneous T2 hyperintense signal within the cystic lesion in keeping with a schwannoma. 
• Sympathetic ganglion tumors (more common in children/young adults) include: 
Ganglioneuroma (most common), a benign tumor of sympathetic ganglion cells. Neuroblastoma, a malignant tumor of ganglion cells seen in early childhood. Ganglioneuroblastoma, intermediate in histology between ganglioneuroma and neuroblastoma, seen in 
older children than neuroblastoma. 
• Paragangliomas can arise in the paravertebral compartment from spinal, intercostal, or sympathetic nerves. 

Contrast enhanced axial CT shows a paravertebral hypervascular mass with heterogeneous areas of necrosis (arrow) consistent with a paraganglioma along the sympathetic chain. 

Extramedullary hematopoiesis 
• 
Extramedullary hematopoiesis presents as soft tissue paravertebral masses in patients with severe hereditary anemias including thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. 

• 
On imaging, lobulated soft tissue masses are typically bilateral and inferior to T6. They may contain internal fat. 


Intrathoracic meningocele 
• An intrathoracic or lateral meningocele is herniation of the leptomeninges through either an intervertebral foramen or a defect in the vertebral body. Lateral meningocele is associated with neurofibromatosis. 
Paraspinal abscess 

Osteomyelitis and paraspinal phlegmon: Radiograph shows displacement of the bilateral paraspinal lines (arrows). Sagittal T1- (middle image) and T2-weighted MRI (right image) shows loss of Disc space height and marrow edema in two adjacent lower thoracic vertebral bodies. There is associated paraspinal phlegmonous change (arrows), which caused the paraspinal line displacement on radiography. 
• A clue to vertebral body pathology on radiography may be paraspinal line displacement.
