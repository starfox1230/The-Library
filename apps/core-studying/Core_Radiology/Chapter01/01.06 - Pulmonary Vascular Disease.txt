Pulmonary vascular disease 
Pulmonary Embolism (PE) 
• Pulmonary embolism can be divided into acute and chronic subtypes Acute PE is associated with the typical symptoms of dyspnea, tachycardia, and pleuritic chest pain Chronic PE may be associated with pulmonary hypertension, further discussed in the next section. 
Acute Pulmonary Embolism 
Clinical diagnosis 
• 
Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) can be challenging because the presenting symptoms are both common and nonspecific, including dyspnea, tachycardia, and pleuritic chest pain. 

• 
Most pulmonary emboli originate in the deep veins of the thighs and pelvis. The risk factors 


for deep venous thrombosis include: Immobilization, malignancy, catheter use, obesity, oral contraceptive use, and thrombophilia. Approximately 25% of patients with PE do not have any identifiable risk factor. 
• 
The Wells score assigns point values to clinical suspicion and various symptoms suggestive of pulmonary embolism. 

• 
D-dimer is sensitive for thromboembolic disease and has a high negative predictive value, but is of little value in the typical inpatient population as there are many false positives. 


Imaging findings of acute pulmonary embolism 

Pulmonary embolism: CT pulmonary angiogram shows a large, nearly-occlusive filling defect in the right main pulmonary artery (arrows) extending distally to the bifurcation. 
• 
CT pulmonary angiogram is the most common method to image for PE, where an embolism is typically seen as a central intraluminal pulmonary artery filling defect. Pulmonary emboli tend to lodge at vessel bifurcations. 

• 
Pulmonary infarction can be seen as peripheral wedge-shaped consolidations often with reverse halo sign. 

• 
Pleural effusions often develop after several days. After congestive heart failure (CHF), parapneumonic effusion, and malignancy, pulmonary infarct is the fourth most common cause of pleural effusion. 

• 
In patients with acute PE, one should always examine the heart for imaging findings of right heart dysfunction which is associated with increased mortality. Findings of right heart strain include: 


Bowing of the intraventricular septum to the left. An elevated RV:LV ratio =1. 
• Presence of right heart strain determines categorization of submassive versus massive PE. Submassive PE shows RV enlargement on imaging or clinical signs of RV dysfunction. Massive PE has systemic hypotension (<90 mmHg). 

Axial CT demonstrates bowing of the interventricular septum to the left (arrow). The right ventricle is larger in diameter than the left ventricle. These are signs of right heart strain. 
Management of acute pulmonary embolism 
Low risk PE (Non-massive): anticoagulation (AC) only or surveillance if isolated subsegmental PE with no proximal lower extremity DVT and low risk for recurrence.  
Intermediate risk (Submassive): AC +/- intervention if more moderate to severe RV strain or any acute distress. Intervention includes systemic IV thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy and catheter-directed therapy.  
High risk (Massive): AC + intervention. Intervention includes surgical embolectomy, systemic IV thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy and catheter-directed therapy.  

• 
While a CT pulmonary angiogram is the standard tool to evaluate for pulmonary embolism, it is important to be aware of plain film findings that could suggest pulmonary embolism in case the diagnosis is not clinically suspected.

Clinical diagnosis 
• 
Chronic PEs present with signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension, including shortness of breath exacerbated with activity, fatigue, and chest pressure or pain. 

• 
Note that not all patients with chronic PE develop pulmonary hypertension. 


Imaging fi ndings 
• 
Chronic PEs present as eccentric filling defects, a web, or pruning of the pulmonary artery branches. 

• 
Note that resolving acute PE will involute with eccentric filling defects or webs. 

• 
Parenchymal signs include mosaic attenuation from altered perfusion and occasionally scarring. 

• 
In these patients, it is important to look for signs of pulmonary hypertension which include: 


Enlargement of the pulmonary artery when the PA to ascending aorta ratio is =1. Right ventricular enlargement and hypertrophy. 
Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) 
• 
CTEPH is the constellation of chronic PE and pulmonary HTN (subsequently discussed). 

• 
Patients are often evaluated with V/Q scan and CT PE since each can miss defects. 

• 
CT shows eccentric organized thrombi, pulmonary artery enlargement, mosaic attenuation and vascular pruning. V/Q scan shows segmental perfusion defects. 




Contrast-enhanced CT axial images demonstrate extensive eccentric mural thrombi involving the distal right main pulmonary artery with foci of calcification (blue arrow). Lung-windows demonstrate enlarged pulmonary arterial trunk (red arrow) and mosaic attenuation of the lung parenchyma (green arrow). 
Pitfalls of CT pulmonary angiogram 
• 
Hilar lymph nodes and mucus-impacted bronchi may simulate PE. 

• 
Unopacified pulmonary veins may simulate PE on a single CT slice; however, one may distinguish between a pulmonary artery and vein by tracing the vessel back to the heart. 

• 
During the Valsalva maneuver, transient disruption of contrast bolus occurs when unopacified blood from the IVC enters the right atrium and is pumped into the lungs. This causes dense contrast to be seen in the SVC, no contrast in the pulmonary artery, and dense contrast in the aorta. On the other hand, late contrast timing would show less dense contrast in the SVC. This can be mitigated by a scan in expiration. 

• 
Cardiac and respiratory motion artifacts can decrease image quality. 


Cardiac motion causes blurring of the left lower lobe pulmonary arteries, which may simulate small emboli. Respiratory motion decreases accuracy in evaluation of small pulmonary arteries. 


Pulmonary Hypertension 

Illustration demonstrating the physiologic changes in pulmonary hypertension. 
A normal lung is on the left and abnormal lung on the right. Key findings include dilated vessels with abrupt change in caliber or abrupt cut-off. Chronic eccentrically located pulmonary thrombus may be seen along the vessel walls. Webs, delicate ribbonlike structures attached to the vessel wall, are often seen in the setting of chronic pulmonary embolus. Mosaic perfusion of the lung parenchyma is due to heterogeneous perfusion. 
• 
The term pulmonary hypertension encompasses both pulmonary arterial and pulmonary venous hypertension. The term pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is generally reserved for the WHO class 1 entities (primary pulmonary hypertension), discussed below. 

• 
Pulmonary hypertension is pulmonary arterial systolic pressure =25 mm Hg at rest or =30 mm Hg during exercise. Elevated pulmonary venous pressures are present when pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (an approximation of pulmonary venous pressure) is =18 mm Hg. 


Overview of pulmonary hypertension classification 
• 
There are a number of causes of pulmonary hypertension including chronic thromboembolic disease, chronic respiratory disease, chronic heart disease, and idiopathic causes. 

• 
The World Health Organization (WHO) clinical classification, based on the 2018 World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension, describes 5 groups of pulmonary hypertension. 


Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) may be idiopathic or familial. Congenital left-to-right shunts, such as atrial septal defect (ASD) and ventricular septal defect (VSD), may 
cause PAH and shunt reversal (Eisenmenger syndrome). Group 1 :. Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH). PAH may be caused by pulmonary venous or capillary involvement. Group 2: Pulmonary venous hypertension. Left-sided heart disease (left atrial, left ventricular, or mitral/aortic valve disease may cause elevated pulmonary venous pressure in chronic disease). Group 3: Pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic hypoxemia. 
COPD, interstitial lung disease, and sleep apnea can cause pulmonary hypertension in chronic disease. Group 4: Pulmonary hypertension due to chronic thromboembolic disease. Group 5: Pulmonary hypertension due to miscellaneous disorders. 
Sarcoidosis is a rare cause of pulmonary hypertension. Compression of pulmonary vessels, which can be due to neoplasm, fibrosing mediastinitis, etc., may cause pulmonary hypertension. 

Pulmonary hypertension: 
Chest radiograph shows an abnormal convex mediastinal bulge representing an enlarged main pulmonary artery (red arrow). 
Noncontrast CT (bottom left image) and gated contrast-enhanced cardiac CT (bottom right image) show that the pulmonary arterial atherosclerotic plaque has both calcified (arrow in noncontrast image) and noncalcified (arrow in contrast-enhanced image) components. The diameter of the main pulmonary artery (PA) is clearly larger than that of the aortic root. 

• 
A main pulmonary artery diameter =2.9 cm suggests the presence of pulmonary hypertension but is not highly sensitive or specific, and pulmonary hypertension may be present with a normal caliber pulmonary artery. A main pulmonary artery diameter larger than the aortic root diameter is also suggestive of pulmonary hypertension. 

• 
Pulmonary artery wall calcifications are pathognomonic for chronic pulmonary artery hypertension typically seen due to shunts. 

• 
Pulmonary hypertension may cause mosaic attenuation due to perfusion abnormalities, most commonly seen in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). 

• 
Pulmonary hypertension may be associated with ground glass centrilobular nodules, which may be cholesterol granulomas representing prior microhemorrhages. Centrilobular nodules may also be seen in PCH. 

• 
An enlarged pulmonary artery can mimic a mediastinal mass. The hilum convergence sign is helpful to confirm that the apparent “mass” in fact represents the pulmonary artery. The hilum convergence sign describes the appearance of hilar pulmonary artery branches converging into an enlarged pulmonary artery. 

• 
In contrast, the hilum overlay sign describes the visualization of hilar vessels through a mass. It indicates that a mediastinal mass is present, which cannot be in the middle mediastinum. 

• 
The pathologic hallmark of primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is the plexiform lesion in the wall of the muscular arteries, which is a focal disruption of the elastic lamina by an obstructing plexus of endothelial channels. 

• 
PPH may be idiopathic (females > males) or familial (approximately 10% of cases). 

• 
On imaging, there is typically enlargement of the main pulmonary arteries with rapidly tapering peripheral vessels. 


Pulmonary hypertension due to left-to-right cardiac shunts – WHO group 1, precapillary 
• 
Congenital left-to-right cardiac shunts, such as ventricular septal defect (VSD), atrial septal defect (ASD), and partial anomalous pulmonary venous return, cause increased flow through the pulmonary arterial bed. This chronically increased flow may eventually lead to irreversible vasculopathy characterized by pulmonary hypertension and reversal of the shunt, known as Eisenmenger syndrome. 

• 
Imaging of PAH secondary to a congenital shunt is similar to that of PPH. There is enlargement of the central and main pulmonary arteries, with peripheral tapering. However, radiologists should look for the presence of an intracardiac or extracardiac shunt in any patient with unexplained pulmonary HTN. 


Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH) – WHO group 1, postcapillary 
• 
PAH secondary to PVOD is caused by fibrotic obliteration of the pulmonary veins and venules. PVOD may be idiopathic but is associated with pregnancy, drugs (especially bleomycin), and bone marrow transplant. 

• 
Imaging features interlobular septal thickening, patchy or centrilobular ground glass opacities, pulmonary arterial enlargement, mosaic attenuation, and pleural effusions. 

• 
PCH is an entity that involves capillary proliferation leading to pulmonary hypertension in children and young adults. 


Pulmonary venous hypertension – WHO group 2, postcapillary 
• 
Left-sided cardiovascular disease leads to elevated pulmonary venous pressure, which is a cause of pulmonary hypertension. 

• 
Most common etiologies are left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction and valvular disease. 



Pulmonary hypertension associated with hypoxemic lung disease – WHO group 3, precapillary 
• 
COPD, sleep apnea, and interstitial lung disease can all lead to pulmonary hypertension. 

• 
Chronic hypoxic vasoconstriction is thought to invoke vascular remodeling leading to hypertrophy of pulmonary arterial vascular smooth muscle and intimal thickening. 

• 
Chronic lung disease can further contribute to obliteration of pulmonary microvasculature through emphysema and the perivascular fibrotic changes of pulmonary fibrosis. 


Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) – WHO group 4, precapillary 
• 
Chronic occlusion of the pulmonary arterial bed can lead to pulmonary arterial hypertension, which is a complication affecting 1–5% of patients who develope acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Of note, many patients with CTEPH never had previously diagnosed acute PE. 

• 
V/Q scan or CT pulmonary angiogram are typically done as part of the workup for new diagnosis of pulmonary HTN to rule out CTEPH. 

• 
Features of chronic PE are described previously. Mosaic attenuation is typical. 

• 
Treatment of CTEPH is surgical pulmonary thromboendarterectomy or balloon pulmonary angioplasty. 





Coronal CT Nuclear medicine perfusion scan 
Fibrosing mediastinitis: CT shows dilation of the main and right pulmonary arteries (yellow arrows). There is a partially imaged right lower lobe pulmonary artery stent (red arrow). Indistinct soft tissue (blue arrows) encases the right upper lobe pulmonary artery, which is narrowed and distally dilated. Mediastinal soft tissue with calcified lymph nodes (green arrows) can be seen posteriorly. Nuclear medicine perfusion scan shows markedly heterogeneous pulmonary perfusion, with near-absence of perfusion of the right upper lobe (white arrow). 
• 
Progressive proliferation of fibrous tissue within the mediastinum may lead to encasement and compression of mediastinal structures. The most common causes of fibrosing mediastinitis are histoplasmosis and tuberculosis. 

• 
Fibrous encasement of the pulmonary veins leads to permanent histological changes within the endothelial cells. 

• 
Fibrosing mediastinitis may also encase the pulmonary arteries, creating a pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension. 

• 
Imaging features of fibrosing mediastinitis include increased mediastinal soft tissue, often with calcified lymph nodes due to prior granulomatous infection.
