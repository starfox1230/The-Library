Pulmonary infection 
Clinical classification of pneumonia 
Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) 
• 
S. pneumoniae is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). 

• 
Atypical pneumonia, including Mycoplasma, viral, and Chlamydia, typically infects young and otherwise healthy patients. 


Mycoplasma has a varied appearance and can produce consolidation, areas of ground glass attenuation, centrilobular nodules, and tree-in-bud nodules. 
• 
Legionella most commonly occurs in elderly smokers. Infections tend to be severe. 

• 
Infection by Klebsiella and other gram-negatives occurs in alcoholics and aspirators. Klebsiella classically leads to voluminous inflammatory exudates causing the bulging fissure sign. 


Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) 
• Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) occurs in hospitalized patients and is due to aspiration of colonized secretions. HAP is caused by a wide variety of organisms, but the most important pathogens include MRSA and resistant gram-negatives including Pseudomonas. 
Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) 
• Healthcare-associated pneumonia is defined as pneumonia in a nursing home resident or in a patient with a >2 day hospitalization over the past 90 days. Pathogens are similar to HAP. 
Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) 
• Ventilator-associated pneumonia is caused by infectious agents not present at the time mechanical ventilation was started. Most infections are polymicrobial and primarily involve gram-negative rods such as Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter. 
Pneumonia in the immunocompromised patient 
• 
Any of the above pathogens, plus opportunistic infections including Pneumocystis, fungi such as Aspergillus, Nocardia, CMV, etc., can be seen in immunocompromised patients. 

• 
Different types of immunocompromise can lead to different infections. In particular, neutropenia predisposes to fungal pneumonia. 




Radiographic patterns of infection 
Lobar pneumonia 
• Lobar pneumonia is consolidation of a single lobe. It is usually bacterial in origin and is the most common presentation of community-acquired pneumonia. The larger bronchi remain patent, causing air bronchograms. 
Bronchopneumonia 
• Bronchopneumonia is patchy peribronchial consolidation with air-space opacities, usually involving several lobes, and may be caused by both bacterial and viral pneumonias as well as aspiration. 
Interstitial pneumonia 
• Interstitial pneumonia is a misnomer, a finding on CXR that usually corresponds to ground glass on CT. Generally it can be caused by atypical (e.g., Mycoplasma, Chlamydia), viral, or Pneumocystis pneumonia. 
Round pneumonia 
• Round pneumonia is an infectious mass-like opacity seen in children, most commonly due to 
S. pneumoniae. Infection remains confined due to incomplete formation of pores of Kohn. 


Complications of pneumonia 
Pulmonary abscess 
• 
Pulmonary abscess is necrosis of the lung parenchyma typically due to Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas, or anaerobic bacteria. 

• 
An air-fluid level is often present. 

• 
An abscess is usually spherical, with equal dimensions on frontal and lateral views. 


Empyema 
• 
Empyema is infection within the pleural space. 

• 
There are three stages in the development of an empyema: 

1) Free-flowing exudative effusion: Can be treated with needle aspiration or simple drain. 
2) Development of fibrous strands: Requires large-bore chest tube and fibrinolytic therapy. 
3) Fluid becomes solid and jelly-like: Usually requires surgery. 

• 
Although pneumonia is often associated with a parapneumonic effusion, most pleural effusions associated with pneumonia are not empyema, but are instead a sterile effusion caused by increased capillary permeability. 

• 
An empyema conforms to the shape of the pleural space, causing a longer air-fluid level on the lateral radiograph. This is in contrast to an abscess, discussed above, which typically is spherical and has the same dimensions on the frontal and lateral radiographs. 

• 
The split pleura sign describes enhancing parietal and visceral pleura of an empyema seen on contrast-enhanced study. 



Split pleura sign: Contrast-enhanced CT shows enhancement of the thickened visceral and parietal pleural layers (arrows), which encase a pleural fluid collection. 
The split pleura sign is seen in the majority of exudative effusions, although it is not specific. Similar findings can be seen in malignant effusion, mesothelioma, fibrothorax, and after talc pleurodesis.

Empyema necessitans 
• Empyema necessitans is extension of an empyema to the chest wall, most commonly secondary to tuberculosis. Other causative organisms include Actinomyces. 

Pneumatocele 
• A pneumatocele is a thin-walled, gas-filled cyst that may be post-traumatic or develop as a sequela of pneumonia, typically from Staphylococcus aureus or Pneumocystis. 
Bronchopleural fistula (BPF) 
• 
Bronchopleural fistula (BPF) is an abnormal communication between the airway and the pleural space. It is caused by rupture of the visceral pleura. By far the most common cause of BPF is surgery; however, other etiologies include lung abscess, empyema, and trauma. 

• 
On imaging, new or increasing gas is present in a pleural effusion. A connection between the bronchial tree and the pleura is not always apparent, but is helpful when seen. 

• 
The treatment of BPF is controversial and highly individualized. 




Tuberculosis (TB) 
• 
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains an important disease despite remarkable progress in public health and antituberculous therapy over the past century. Tuberculosis remains a significant problem in developing countries. In the United States, TB is seen primarily in immigrant, institutionalized, and immunocompromised individuals. 

• 
Initial exposure to TB can lead to two clinical outcomes: 

1) Contained disease (90%) results in calcified granulomas and/or calcified hilar lymph nodes. In a patient with normal immunity, the tuberculous bacilli are sequestered with a caseating granulomatous response. 
2) Primary tuberculosis results when the host cannot contain the organism. Primary tuberculosis is seen more commonly in children and immunocompromised patients. 

• 
Reactivation (post-primary) TB is reactivation of a previously latent infection. 


Primary tuberculosis 

Primary TB: Chest radiograph (left image) shows a vague right upper lung opacity (arrow). CT shows a patchy opacification (arrow) in the lower portion of the right upper lobe with adjacent tree-in-bud nodularity. The patient's sputum grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 
Case courtesy Ritu R. Gill, MD, MPH, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Primary TB represents infection from the first exposure to TB. Primary TB may involve the pulmonary parenchyma, the airways, and the pleura. Primary TB often causes adenopathy. 

• 
As many as 15% of patients infected with primary TB have no radiographic changes and the imaging appearance of primary TB is nonspecific. 

• 
The typical imaging manifestation of primary TB is lobar consolidation +/- pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy, although not all of these need to be present. Primary TB may occur in any lobe. Both primary and reactivation TB can also present as isolated pleural disease or miliary disease, see next section on miliary TB. 

• 
Classic imaging findings are not always seen, but include: 


Ghon focus: Initial focus of parenchymal infection, usually located in the upper part of the lower lobe or the lower part of the upper lobe. Ranke complex: Ghon focus and lymphadenopathy. 
• 
Cavitation is rare in primary TB, in contrast to reactivation TB. 

• 
Adenopathy is common in primary TB, typically featuring central low-attenuation and peripheral enhancement, especially in children. 



Tuberculous adenopathy: Contrast-enhanced neck CT shows marked right-sided adenopathy (arrows) with peripheral enhancement and central necrosis.

Reactivation (post-primary) tuberculosis 
• 
Reactivation TB, also called post-primary TB, usually occurs in adolescents and adults and is caused by reactivation of a dormant infection acquired earlier in life. Clinical manifestations of reactivation TB include chronic cough, low-grade fever, hemoptysis, and night sweats. 

• 
Reactivation TB most commonly occurs in the upper lobe apical and posterior segments and superior segments of the lower lobes. 



Reactivation TB: Frontal chest radiograph (left image) shows a cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe (arrow), confirmed by CT (arrow). There was no significant mediastinal adenopathy. The differential diagnosis of this appearance would include cavitary primary lung cancer, which would be expected to feature a thicker wall. 
Case courtesy Michael Hanley, MD, University of Virginia Health System. 
• 
In an immunocompetent patient, the imaging hallmarks of reactivation TB are upper-lobe predominant consolidation with cavitation. Tree-in-bud nodules are common and suggest active endobronchial spread. 

• 
Low-attenuation adenopathy is a common additional finding, seen more often in immunocompromised patients. 

• 
A tuberculoma is a well-defined rounded opacity consisting of an encapsulating fibrous wall with central caseation, usually in the upper lobes. 


Healed tuberculosis 

Healed TB: Radiograph shows scarring, volume loss, and superior hilar retraction (arrows). CT shows apical scarring. Case courtesy Ritu R. Gill, MD, MPH, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Healed TB is evident on radiography as apical scarring, usually with upper lobe volume loss and superior hilar retraction. 

• 
Calcified granulomas may be present as well, which indicate containment of the initial infection by a delayed hypersensitivity response. 


Miliary tuberculosis 

Miliary TB: Radiograph and CT show innumerable tiny nodules in a random pattern, reflecting hematogenous seeding of TB. Case courtesy Ritu R. Gill, MD, MPH, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Miliary TB is a diffuse random distribution of tiny nodules seen in hematogenously disseminated TB. 

• 
Miliary TB can occur in primary or reactivation TB. 




Atypical mycobacteria 
Atypical mycobacteria infection 

Mycobacterium avium intracellulare infection: Coronal (left image) and axial CT show right upper lobe and lingular tree-in-bud opacities and bronchiectasis, with more focal consolidation in the lingula (arrow). 
• 
There are three types of atypical mycobacterial infection: 

(1)
 “Classic” or nodular cavitary form that simulates TB; typically seen in patients with chronic lung disease. 

(2)
 Non-classic or bronchiectatic form (more common). 

(3)
 Disseminated form, typically lymphadenopathy in immunocompromised patients (usually AIDS). 



• 
The presentation of bronchiectatic atypical mycobacteria is an elderly woman with cough, low-grade fever, and weight loss, called Lady Windermere syndrome. Mycobacterium avium intracellulare and M. kansasii are the two most common organisms. 


Radiographic findings are bronchiectasis and tree-in-bud nodules, most common in the right middle lobe and lingula. 
“Hot-tub” lung 
• “Hot-tub” lung is a hypersensitivity pneumonitis in response to atypical mycobacteria, which are often found in hot tubs. There is no active infection and the typical patient is otherwise healthy. Imaging is similar to other causes of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, featuring centrilobular nodules. 

Endemic fungi 
• Endemic fungi can cause pneumonia in normal individuals, with each subtype having a specific geographic distribution. 
Histoplasma capsulatum 
• 
Histoplasma capsulatum is localized to the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys, in soil contaminated with bat or bird guano. 

• 
Acute infection usually produces nodules and lymphadenopathy. 

• 
Chronic sequela of infection is a calcified granuloma. A less common radiologic manifestation is a pulmonary nodule (histoplasmoma), which can mimic a neoplasm. 

• 
Fibrosing mediastinitis is a rare complication of Histoplasma infection of mediastinal lymph nodes leading to pulmonary venous obstruction, bronchial stenosis, and pulmonary artery stenosis. Affected lymph nodes tend to calcify. 


Coccidioides immitis and Blastomyces dermatitidis 
• 
Coccidioides immitis is found in the southwestern United States and has a variety of radiologic appearances, including multifocal consolidation, multiple pulmonary nodules, and miliary nodules. 

• 
Blastomyces dermatitidis is found in the central and southeastern United States. Infection is usually asymptomatic, but may present as flu-like illness that can progress to multifocal consolidation, ARDS, or miliary disease. 




Viral pneumonia 
• 
In general, viral pneumonias have a large overlap with bacterial pneumonias in imaging appearance. 

• 
Classic imaging findings on CT include centrilobular or tree-in-bud nodules, patchy ground glass opacities, and bronchopneumonia (peribronchial consolidations). 


Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
• 
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., COVID-19) is a respiratory viral disease that became a pandemic in early 2020. 

• 
Imaging findings are nonspecific, however bilateral, dependent, lower-lobe predominant ground glass opacities or consolidations are classic features. 

• 
Pleural effusions, centrilobular nodules, and tree-in-bud nodules are typically not associated. 



COVID-19 infection: Chest radiograph (left image) shows bilateral peripheral opacities (arrows). Chest CT (right) in a different patient shows peripheral ground glass and consolidations in both lungs (arrows). 

Infections in the immunocompromised 
• 
Immunosuppressed patients are susceptible to the same organisms that infect immunocompetent patients; however, one must be aware of several additional opportunistic organisms that may present in the immunocompromised. 

• 
An immunocompromised patient with a focal air space opacity is most likely to have a bacterial pneumonia (most commonly pneumococcus), but TB should also be considered if the CD4 count is low. 

• 
In contrast, multifocal opacities have a wider differential diagnosis including Pneumocystis pneumonia and opportunistic fungal infection such as Cryptococcus or Aspergillus. 


Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia 
• Pneumocystis jiroveci (previously called Pneumocystis carinii) is an opportunistic fungus that may cause pneumonia in individuals with CD4 counts <200 cells/cc or other T-cell deficiency (e.g., status post bone marrow transplant or solid organ transplant). The incidence of Pneumocystis pneumonia is decreasing due to routine antibiotic prophylaxis. 


Pneumocystis pneumonia: Radiograph (top left image) shows multiple upper-lobe predominant airspace opacities. CT (top image) shows crazy paving (arrows), with confluent ground glass attenuation in the upper lobes. 
Axial CT in a different patient with Pneumocystis pneumonia (bottom left image) shows asymmetric ground glass opacification, with thin-walled cysts. 
Cases courtesy Ritu R. Gill, MD, MPH, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Chest radiograph findings can be normal but a classic finding of Pneumocystis pneumonia is bilateral perihilar (central) airspace opacities with peripheral sparing. 

• 
The classic CT appearance is ground glass opacification, sometimes with crazy paving (ground glass and thickening of the interlobular septa). 

• 
A normal CT rules out Pneumocystis pneumonia; however, the disease can hide in a normal chest radiograph. 

• 
Pneumocystis pneumonia has a propensity to cause upper lobe pneumatoceles particularly if untreated, which may predispose to pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. 


Cryptococcus neoformans 
• 
Cryptococcus is an opportunistic organism and is the most common fungal infection in AIDS 

patients. Pulmonary infection usually coexists with cryptococcal meningitis. Typically CD4 count is less than 100 cells/cc in affected individuals. 

• 
In the immunosuppressed, Cryptococcus can have a wide range of appearances ranging from ground glass attenuation to focal consolidation to cavitary nodules. Cryptococcus can also present as miliary disease, often associated with lymphadenopathy or effusions. 




Aspergillus 
Overview of Aspergillus 



increased/inappropriate immune response 

ÿnger-in-glove sign:Asthma or CF?
     mucoid impaction of     bronchiectasis

Neutropenic or 

tree-in-bud nodules

halo sign: acute infection     peripheral ground glass 
air crescent sign:      crescentic air in a cavity 
• Aspergillus is a ubiquitous soil fungus that manifests as five distinct categories of pulmonary disease. Aspergillus only affects those with abnormal immunity or preexisting pulmonary disease. Depending on the manifestation, the predisposing abnormality may include asthma, immunocompromised state, prior infection, or structural/congenital abnormality. 
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) 

Finger-in-glove sign of ABPA: Chest radiograph shows upper-lobe predominant bronchiectasis with branching perihilar opacities. CT shows dense bronchial mucoid impaction representing the finger-in-glove sign (arrow). 
Case courtesy Ritu R. Gill, MD, MPH, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a hypersensitivity reaction to aspergillus seen most commonly in patients with long-standing asthma. ABPA is not an infection. 

• 
Patients present clinically with recurrent wheezing, low-grade fever, cough, and sputum production containing fragments of aspergillus hyphae. The diagnosis may be made using serum testing for aspergillus IgE. 

• 
The key finding on CT is central bronchiectasis and mucoid impaction, which can be high attenuation or even calcified. This combination of mucoid impaction within bronchiectatic airways represents the finger-in-glove sign. 


The finger-in-glove sign is not specific to ABPA, however high attenuation mucus is a specific finding. 
Saprophytic aspergillosis (aspergilloma) 
• An aspergilloma is a conglomeration of intertwined aspergillus fungal hyphae and cellular debris (a mycetoma or “fungus ball”) in a preexisting pulmonary cavity. 
The aspergilloma is mobile and will shift position when the patient is imaged in a different position. 
• The most common causes of a preexisting cavity are prior TB and sarcoidosis. Less common causes include congenital anomalies 
such as bronchogenic cyst or sequestration, and post-infectious/post-traumatic pneumatocele. 
Aspergilloma and Monod sign: CT shows an irregular

correct term is Monod sign. The air crescent 
sign is reserved for angioinvasive aspergillus. 


Semi-invasive (chronic necrotizing) aspergillosis 
• 
Semi-invasive aspergillosis is a necrotizing granulomatous inflammation (analogous in pathology to reactivation TB) in response to chronic aspergillus infection. Semi-invasive aspergillosis is seen in debilitated, diabetic, alcoholic, and COPD patients. 

• 
Clinical symptoms include cough, chronic fever, and less commonly hemoptysis. 

• 
On CT, there are segmental areas of consolidation, often with cavitation and pleural thickening, which progress slowly over months or years. 


Airway-invasive aspergillosis 
• 
Airway-invasive aspergillosis is aspergillus infection deep to the airway epithelial cells. It is seen only in the immunocompromised, including neutropenic and AIDS patients. 

• 
The spectrum of clinical disease ranges from bronchiolitis to bronchopneumonia. 

• 
The main CT findings of airway-invasive aspergillosis are centrilobular and tree-in­bud nodules. When bronchopneumonia is present, radiograph and CT findings are indistinguishable from other causes of bronchopneumonia, such as Staph. aureus. 


Angioinvasive aspergillosis 
• 
Angioinvasive aspergillosis is an aggressive infection characterized by invasion and occlusion of arterioles and smaller pulmonary arteries by fungal hyphae. Angioinvasive aspergillosis is seen almost exclusively in neutropenic patients. 

• 
The CT halo sign represents a halo of ground glass attenuation surrounding a consolidation. The ground glass corresponds to hemorrhage. 



Halo sign: CT shows a left upper lobe mass with peripheral ground glass (yellow arrow), representing pulmonary hemorrhage. 
Case courtesy Michael Hanley, MD, University of Virginia Health System. 
The halo sign is not specific to angioinvasive aspergillosis, and can also be seen in viral infection, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), Kaposi sarcoma, hemorrhagic metastasis, and others. 
• The air crescent sign represents a crescent of air from retraction of infarcted lung and occurs with recovery of neutrophil counts. It a good prognostic sign as it indicates that the patient is in the recovery phase. 

Air crescent sign: Noncontrast CT shows a lesion in the left lower lobe with a crescent-shaped air collection anteriorly (arrows).
