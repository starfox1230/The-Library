Pulmonary artery catheter 

Normal position of a Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheter: 
Chest radiograph with a sharpening filter applied shows a left internal jugular pulmonary artery catheter that takes a normal course through the SVC, right atrium, tricuspid valve, right ventricle, pulmonic valve, and finally the right pulmonary artery (arrow). 

• 
The tip of a Swan-Ganz pulmonary artery catheter should be in either the main, right, or left pulmonary artery. 

• 
If the tip is distal to the proximal interlobar pulmonary artery, there is a risk of pulmonary artery rupture or pseudoaneurysm. Other complications of pulmonary artery catheter placement include intracardiac catheter knot and arrhythmia. 



Lung cancer 
Clinical overview of lung cancer 
Epidemiology 
• 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. 

• 
Including all stages and subtypes, the 5-year survival is 15%. 


Risk factors for lung cancer 
• Tobacco smoking is thought to cause 80–90% of lung cancers. Almost all cases of squamous cell and small cell carcinoma are seen in smokers. Adenocarcinoma is also associated with smoking, but primary bronchogenic carcinoma arising in a lifelong 
nonsmoker without history of secondhand exposure is almost always adenocarcinoma. 
• 
Occupational and environmental exposures, including beryllium, radon, arsenic, etc., remain important risk factors for lung cancer. Asbestos exposure increases the risk of lung cancer by a factor of five, synergistic with smoking. 

• 
Pulmonary fibrosis increases the risk of lung cancer by a factor of ten. 

• 
Pulmonary scarring, such as from prior TB, also increases the risk of lung cancer. 




Solitary pulmonary nodule 
Overview of the solitary pulmonary nodule 
• 
A solitary pulmonary nodule is a well-defined round or oval lesion in the lung parenchyma measuring =30 mm. A lesion >30 mm is a mass. 

• 
Differential diagnosis includes neoplastic, inflammatory, congenital etiologies. 

• 
Common mimics on radiograph include nipple shadow, rib lesion, and summation of markings. 



Solid pulmonary nodules 
• Calcified nodules, including central, laminar, and diffuse calcification, are almost always benign. 
Popcorn calcification is suggestive of a pulmonary hamartoma, a benign tumor composed of connective tissue, muscle, fat, bone, and cartilage. 
• 
Noncalcified nodules can be benign or malignant. Intra-lesional fat, suggestive of hamartoma or lipoid granuloma, is benign. 

• 
Amorphous calcification is associated with malignancy (usually mucinous tumors) 



Noncontrast chest CT on bone windows shows a soft tissue mass with popcorn like calcifications in the left upper lobe, consistent with a benign hamartoma. 

Nodule morphology suggesting, but not diagnostic for, a benign etiology 
Small nodules <3 mm have a 0.2% chance of being cancer and a 4–7 mm nodule is malignant in 2.7% of cases. Oblong, polygonal, triangular, flat or geometric in shape, typically intrapulmonary lymph nodes. Subpleural location. Clustering of nodules suggests an infectious process. 

Nodule morphology suggesting malignancy 
Large size is the single most important risk factor for malignancy, regardless of morphology: 0.8 to 3 cm nodules have 18% risk of being lung cancer and masses >3 cm have a high chance of being malignant. 
Irregular edge or spiculated margins. 

Subsolid nodules 
• 
Ground glass nodules (or mixed attenuation nodules containing both solid and ground glass) are more likely to be malignant than a solid nodule. 

• 
A cavitary nodule or nodule containing small cystic spaces is suspicious for malignancy. 



Follow-up of pulmonary nodule 
• 
The 2017 Fleischner Society pulmonary nodule follow-up recommendations apply to noncalcified nodules in patients older than 35 without a history of malignancy. 

• 
Risk factors for malignancy include older age, heavy smoking, emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and upper lobe location. 

• 
Follow-up is not recommended for low risk patients with solitary or multiple pulmonary nodules <6 mm. 

• 
Any interval nodule growth is suspicious. A 26% increase in diameter (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.26 cm) is a doubling in volume. 


Doubling time for lung cancers ranges from 42 days in very aggressive tumors to over 4 years in indolent lesions. 
• 
A solid nodule with well-defined benign morphology that has not changed in size over two years is very likely, but not definitely, benign. Longer follow-up is recommended for subsolid nodules as these often represent indolent adenocarcinomas. 

• 
A decrease in size of a suspicious nodule on a single follow-up study is not sufficient to 


establish a benign etiology. Transient decrease in size of a malignant lesion can occur with collapse of aerated alveoli or fibrosis. 


Histologic subtypes of lung cancer 

• 
Lung cancer can be thought of as two types: “small cell” and all other histologic types that are non-small cell, such as adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, etc. 

• 
Small cell is usually disseminated at diagnosis and has a much worse prognosis. 


Adenocarcinoma 
• 
Adenocarcinoma is the most common subtype of lung cancer. It is related to smoking, but less strongly than squamous cell. 

• 
Cavitation can occur but is less commonly seen compared to squamous cell. 

• 
The typical radiologic presentations of adenocarcinoma include: 

1.
 A solitary nodule with spiculated margins due to surrounding reactive fibrosis. 

2.
 Pure ground glass nodule or sub solid nodule with ground glass and solid components. 

3.
 Consolidative adenocarcinoma which may present as diffuse ground glass opacities or consolidation resembling airspace disease.  



• 
In 2011, the IASLC/ATS/ERS classification removed the term “bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC)” and introduced a new spectrum of adenocarcinoma subtypes. 


Pre-invasive lesions. Atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH). Adenocarcinoma in-situ (AIS): non-mucinous, mucinous, mixed. Minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA): non-mucinous, mucinous, mixed. Invasive adenocarcinomas: lepidic, acinar, papillary, micropapillary, or solid with mucin production. 
• Lepidic growth is a spread of malignant cells using the alveolar walls as a scaffold. The opposite of lepidic growth is hilic growth, demonstrated by most other forms of lung cancer, which describes cancer growth by invasion and destruction of lung parenchyma. 

Axial CT shows a solid nodule with air bronchograms (yellow arrow) and a more peripheral ground glass nodule (red arrow), both shown to be adenocarcinoma subtypes on pathology. 
Axial contrast-enhanced CT shows a right lower lobe consolidative opacity with air bronchograms (arrow). Adenocarcinoma is an important differential consideration for chronic ground glass or consolidation. 

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) 
• 
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is slightly less common today than adenocarcinoma. Prior to filtered cigarettes, SCC was more common. 

• 
SCC most commonly presents as a spiculated nodule, just like adenocarcinoma. However, it can also present as an endobronchial or hilar lesion. 

• 
The majority of SCC arise centrally from main, lobar, or segmental bronchi, where the tumor tends to cause symptoms early due to bronchial obstruction. 

• 
Common radiographic findings are lobar atelectasis, mucoid impaction, consolidation, and bronchiectasis. SCC has a propensity to cavitate. 



Small cell carcinoma 
• 
Small cell carcinoma is the third most common lung cancer cell type (after adenocarcinoma and squamous cell). Neoplastic cells are of neuroendocrine origin and are associated with various paraneoplastic syndromes. Small cell carcinoma is strongly associated with smoking. 

• 
Small cell usually presents as mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy, typically presenting as a large hilar or parahilar mass. Involvement of the SVC may cause SVC syndrome. Small cell rarely presents as a solitary pulmonary nodule. 

• 
The primary tumor is usually not identified. 

• 
For staging purposes, small cell is divided into limited-stage involving one hemithorax and extensive-stage disease. The limited-stage is treated with chemoradiation whereas the extensive-stage disease is treated with chemotherapy alone. 




Radiograph Coronal CT Axial CT 
Small cell carcinoma: Chest radiograph shows a right paratracheal opacity which corresponds to mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy on CT. The lesion encases but does not significantly narrow the involved bronchi and main pulmonary artery. 

Large cell carcinoma 
• 
Large cell carcinoma often occurs in the lung periphery, where it presents as a large solid mass with irregular margins. Focal necrosis can be present. 

• 
Histologically, large cell carcinoma is characterized by large nuclei and nucleoli with a moderate amount of cytoplasm. 

• 
Large cell carcinoma can have rapid growth and early metastasis with overall poor prognosis. 




Carcinoid tumor 
• 
Neoplastic carcinoid cells originate from neuroendocrine cells in the bronchial walls. 

• 
Carcinoid tumor can either present as a pulmonary nodule (up to 20% of cases) or as an endobronchial lesion. The latter typically is located distal to the carina and may cause obstructive atelectasis. 

• 
Carcinoid may be typical (low-grade) or the more aggressive atypical variant. Typical carcinoids without nodal or distant metastases have an excellent prognosis (92% 5-year survival). Atypical carcinoids tend to arise peripherally and have a worse prognosis. 

• 
Diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH) is an uncommon syndrome characterized by multiple foci of neuroendocrine hyperplasia or tumorlets (carcinoid foci <5 mm in size) and bronchiolitis obliterans as well as multiple carcinoid tumors. Radiologic presentation shows multiple pulmonary nodules with mosaic attenuation of the lungs secondary to air trapping from airflow obstruction. 



DIPNECH: Axial CT demonstrates several subcentimeter nodules (yellow arrow) and mosaic attenuation of the lungs (red arrow), in a case of diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia. 

Pulmonary Lymphoma 

Pulmonary lymphoma: Axial CT demonstrates a region of dense consolidation involving the right upper and lower lobes with air bronchograms (arrow). 
• Primary pulmonary lymphoma is rare. 
Most commonly mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALToma), a form of extranodal B-cell 
lymphoma. 
Most common presentation is mass-like consolidations limited to the lung parenchyma without 
mediastinal nodal involvement. Pleural based masses, peribronchial or perivascular thickening, and interstitial infiltrates can also be present. 
• Secondary pulmonary lymphoma is relatively common and includes manifestations of both 
Hodgkin disease and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 
CT imaging features include lymphangitis, nodular, or consolidative pattern. 
Hodgkin disease presents as parenchymal involvement with lymphadenopathy as contiguous spread of 
disease and may cavitate. 
• Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) presents as new pulmonary nodules in a patient after solid organ transplantation. Lymphadenopathy is often present. 

PTLD: Axial CT demonstrates a new nodule (arrow) in the right lower lobe in a patient 7 months following bilateral lung transplantation. 
This was biopsied, with pathology of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. 

Radiologic presentation of lung cancer 
Segmental or lobar atelectasis 
• 
Atelectasis due to bronchial obstruction is a common presentation of lung cancer. 

• 
Despite the presence of atelectasis, volume loss is variable, secondary to the volume-displacing effects of cells, mucus, and fluid. 

• 
Obstructive pneumonia is a common presentation of lung cancer, caused by bronchial obstruction and parenchymal consolidation by inflammatory cells and lipid-laden macrophages. 

• 
If two foci of atelectasis are present simultaneously that cannot be explained by a single endobronchial lesion, a benign process is much more likely. 



Consolidation 
• Consolidation that is indistinguishable from pneumonia can be seen with adenocarcinoma. Although adenocarcinoma and pneumonia may appear similar, adenocarcinoma is usually a non-resolving consolidation with (near) normal white blood cell count. 
Hilar mass 

Lung cancer presenting as a hilar mass: Frontal radiograph (left image) shows a right paramediastinal opacity (arrow), which does not silhouette the right heart border. CT shows a large right infrahilar mass (arrows). 
• 
A hilar mass is a common presentation of squamous cell and small cell carcinoma. 

• 
Hilar enlargement may be due to a primary central tumor or nodal metastasis from a parenchymal neoplasm. 

• 
Tumor may compress and narrow the bronchus. 


Superior sulcus tumor 

Superior sulcus tumor: Chest radiograph shows nearly imperceptible increased opacity in the right apex (arrow). A superior sulcus mass is clearly evident on CT (arrows), with encasement of the vasculature and effacement of the superior mediastinal fat. 
Case courtesy Ritu R. Gill, MD, MPH, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
A superior sulcus tumor is a lung cancer occurring in the lung apex. 

• 
A Pancoast tumor is a type of superior sulcus tumor with involvement of the sympathetic ganglia causing a Horner syndrome, with ipsilateral ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis. 

• 
A superior sulcus tumor is a stage T3 tumor. The staging of lung cancer is subsequently discussed. 


Lymphangitic carcinomatosis 

Lymphangitic carcinomatosis: Axial (left image) and coronal CT shows asymmetric, nodular septal thickening of the right lung in a patient with metastatic uterine sarcoma. Aside from a trace effusion, the left lung is clear. 
Case courtesy Ritu R. Gill, MD, MPH, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Lymphangitic carcinomatosis represents diffuse spread of neoplasm through the pulmonary lymphatics, typically seen in late-stage disease. 

• 
On imaging, carcinomatosis manifests as smooth or nodular interlobular septal thickening, which is often asymmetric. 



Pleural effusion 
• 
Pleural effusions are relatively common in lung cancer, which may be due to lymphatic obstruction or pleural metastases. 

• 
A malignant effusion is the presence of malignant cells within the effusion. A malignant effusion is an M1a lesion, which precludes curative resection. Not all effusions associated with lung cancer are malignant effusions, so cytologic evaluation is necessary. 




Staging of lung cancer 
Overview of lung cancer staging 
• 
The eighth edition of the TNM system, published in 2018, is based on data collected on over 77,000 patients with lung cancer from 1999 to 2010. 

• 
The eighth edition re-categorizes tumor size by upstaging T-classifiers to reflect that survival is inversely proportional to every centimeter increase in size until 7 cm; at this point, the same prognosis as T4 disease is reached. 

• 
Extrathoracic metastases that were classified as M1b in the seventh edition are further subcategorized into M1b (oligometastatic) and M1c (multiple metastases) in the eighth edition, to better define oligometastasis, which has a better prognosis and may benefit from more aggressive local therapy. 


Treatment based on staging 
• 
For early stages up to IIB and sometimes IIIA, surgery is usually performed. Neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be used. 

• 
Stage IIIB (N3 – contralateral or supraclavicular nodes; or T4/N2) is unresectable. 

• 
Stage IV disease is generally not treated surgically unless there is a solitary adrenal or brain metastasis. 



T (tumor) 
• 
T1: Tumor =3 cm surrounded by lung or visceral pleura. T1a: Tumor =1 cm; T1b: >1 and =2 cm; T1c: >2 and =3 cm 

• 
T2: Tumor >3 cm and =5 cm, or local invasion of the visceral pleura, or endobronchial 


lesions. T2a: >3 to =4 cm; T2b: >4 and =5 cm 
• 
T3: Tumor >5 to =7 cm, or local invasion of chest wall, pericardium, phrenic nerve, or metastatic nodules in the same lobe 

• 
T4: >7 cm, or invasion of mediastinum, diaphragm, heart, great vessels, recurrent laryngeal nerve, carina, trachea, esophagus, spine or separate tumor nodule in a different lobe in the ipsilateral lung 


N (nodes) 
• The color coding of the lymph nodes on the diagram on the following page represents the nodal staging of lung cancer for an example left-sided mass: 

N1: ipsilateral hilar nodes and intrapulmonary nodes N2: ipsilateral mediastinal nodes 
10 - hilar 2 - upper paratracheal 
11 - interlobar (adjacent to interlobar bronchi) 3 - prevascular (anterior to aorta, not shown) 
12 - lobar (adjacent to lobar bronchi) 4 - paratracheal 
13 - segmental 5 - subaortic (AP window) 
14 - subsegmental 6 - paraaortic 
7 - subcarinal 
8 - paraesophageal 
9 - pulmonary ligament 
N3:   1 - supraclavicular nodes (any side)          any contralateral node 
•
the boundary between right and left for level 2 and 4 lymph nodes is set as the left lateral border of the trachea due to ˜ow of lymphatic drainage. 

• 
in this example of a left-sided primary, the right-sided nodes are drawn in orange to demonstrate N3 due to contralaterality 


• 
N0: No lymph node metastases. 

• 
N1: Ipsilateral hilar or intrapulmonary lymph nodes (green in diagram above). 

• 
N2: Ipsilateral mediastinal nodes (yellow in diagram above). 

• 
N3: Contralateral mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes, or supraclavicular nodes on either side (orange in diagram above). 


M (metastasis) 
• 
M0: No metastatic disease. 

• 
M1a: Local thoracic metastatic disease. Separate tumor nodule in contralateral lung Malignant pleural or pericardial effusion 

• 
M1b: Single extrathoracic metastasis, including single non-regional lymph node. 

• 
M1c: Multiple extrathoracic metastases in one or more organs. 


Example staging: Stage IIIA 

Stage IIIA lung cancer: Axial CT in lung windows (left image) shows a right upper lobe peripheral mass (arrow) that abuts the pleura. There is diffuse centrilobular emphysema. Soft-tissue window CT shows ipsilateral right paratracheal adenopathy (arrow). The T staging is T2 (for size >3 cm) and the N staging is N2 for ipsilateral mediastinal nodes. The overall stage is therefore IIIA and this tumor is resectable.

Example staging: Stage IV 

Stage IV lung cancer: Axial CT (left image) shows a dominant, spiculated right upper lobe T2 mass. More inferiorly (right image), a small contralateral nodule (arrow) is present. This nodule was determined to be malignant on follow-up, for an M staging of M1a and stage IVA disease.
