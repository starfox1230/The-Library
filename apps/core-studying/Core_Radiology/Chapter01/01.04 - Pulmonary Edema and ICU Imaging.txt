Pulmonary edema and ICU imaging 
Pulmonary edema 
Overview of pulmonary edema 

Mild pulmonary edema: Radiograph demonstrates moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and sternotomy wires. There are increased interstitial markings with Kerley B lines (arrows). Chest CT shows smooth interlobular septal thickening (arrows), corresponding to the Kerley B lines seen on radiography. Mild geographic ground glass attenuation likely corresponds to early alveolar filling. 
• 
The radiographic severity of pulmonary edema typically progresses through three stages, corresponding to progressively increased pulmonary venous pressures. 

• 
Vascular redistribution is the first radiographic sign of increased pulmonary venous pressure. Imaging shows increased caliber of the upper lobe vessels compared to the lower lobe vessels. 

• 
Interstitial edema is caused by increased fluid within the pulmonary veins, which surround the periphery of each secondary pulmonary lobule. On radiography, there are increased interstitial markings, indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature, peribronchial cuffing, and Kerley B lines. 


Kerley B lines are seen at the peripheral lung and represent thickened interlobular septa. 
• 
Alveolar edema is caused by filling of the alveoli with fluid. Edema typically has a perihilar (central) distribution. Pleural effusions and cardiomegaly are often present. 

• 
CT findings of pulmonary edema include dependent or central ground glass opacification and interlobular septal thickening. 

• 
Pulmonary edema is usually symmetric and dependent. A classic cause of asymmetric pulmonary edema is isolated right upper lobe pulmonary edema, caused by acute mitral regurgitation secondary to myocardial infarction and papillary muscle rupture. 

• 
A complication of aggressive thoracentesis is reexpansion pulmonary edema, caused by rapid reexpansion of a lung in a state of collapse for more than three days.

Support devices 
Endotracheal tube 
• 
The endotracheal tube tip should be approximately 4–6 cm above the carina with the neck in neutral alignment. However, in situations with low pulmonary compliance (e.g., ARDS), a tip position closer to the carina may reduce barotrauma. 

• 
Direct intubation of either the right or left mainstem bronchus (right mainstem bronchus far more common) is an emergent finding that can cause complete atelectasis of the un-intubated lung. 



Central venous catheters 

Right mainstem bronchus intubation: Chest radiograph shows the endotracheal tube terminating in the right mainstem bronchus (yellow arrow), a few centimeters distal to the carina (red arrow). 

Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) in the azygous vein: Frontal radiograph shows a left-sided PICC coursing medially at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein and the SVC (arrow). Lateral radiograph shows the PICC curves anteriorly before heading inferiorly and posteriorly into the azygous vein (arrow).

• 
The tip of a central venous catheter, including a PICC should be in lower SVC or the cavoatrial junction. Azygous malposition is seen in approximately 1% of bedside-placed PICCs. Azygous malposition is associated with increased risk of venous perforation and catheter-associated thrombosis, and repositioning is recommended. 

• 
A dialysis catheter should be located in the right atrium.
