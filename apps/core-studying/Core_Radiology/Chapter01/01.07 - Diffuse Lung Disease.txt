Diffuse lung disease 
Interstitial Lung Disease 
Overview of interstitial lung disease 
• Interstitial lung disease (ILD) may be idiopathic, or secondary to known insults which include drug toxicity, collagen vascular disease, or occupational exposure. 
A disease can only be classified as an idiopathic interstitial lung disease if there is no other explanation for the pathologic changes. 
• 
Non-specific clinical symptoms of ILD consist of cough and dyspnea, however factors such as age, gender, risk factors, course of disease, and imaging features can help distinguish between the various entities. 

• 
Histologically, the lung responds to injury by recruiting lymphocytes or macrophages, increasing inflammatory debris, and instigating a fibrotic reaction. 

• 
There are eight entities which fall under ILD. The pathologic entities may have different clinical syndromes.

Table showing types of interstitial lung disease. 

Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) 
• Idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis (IPF) is the clinical syndrome of UIP with unknown cause and is the most common cause of UIP. IPF has a much worse clinical outcome compared to secondary causes of UIP. 
The mean survival of IPF is not much diff erent compared to lung cancer. Of all the intersti ti al pneumonias, only acute intersti ti al pneumoniti s (AIP) has a worse prognosis. Clinical symptoms of IPF include dry cough and dyspnea. IPF usually aff ects male pati ents >50 years old, and typically smokers. 
• Other triggers of lung injury that may result in a UIP patt ern include: Collagen vascular disease (rheumatoid arthriti s much more commonly than scleroderma). Drug toxicity. Asbestosis. An imaging clue to the presence of asbestosis is calcifi ed plaques indicati ve of prior asbestos 
exposure. 
• The pathology of UIP features intersti ti al fi broblasti c foci and chronic alveolar infl ammati on with temporal and spati al heterogeneity. 
Noncontrast CT shows subpleural reti culati ons and honeycombing (arrow). 
• 
Early UIP features reti culati on in the posterior subpleural lung bases. 

• 
In later stages of UIP, tracti on bronchiectasis and subpleural honeycombing develop. The lung bases are the most severely aff ected. 

• 
Surgical biopsy can be avoided if characteristi c features, in parti cular peripheral basal locati on of reti culati on, are present. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) developed updated guidelines in 2018 for how to characterize a UIP patt ern on CT. 


Nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP) 

NSIP: Axial CT shows posterior basal predominant subpleural and peribronchial reticulation, mild ground glass attenuation, and mild traction bronchiectasis. This presentation likely represents the fibrotic subtype of NSIP. 
Esophageal dilation (arrow) is a clue to the presence of scleroderma, which is often associated with NSIP.

• 
Nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP) is both the name of the clinical syndrome and the corresponding pathologic diagnosis. Affected patients are typically younger (40–50 years old) compared to IPF. Symptoms are similar to IPF with chronic dry cough and dyspnea. 

• 
NSIP has a better 5-year survival compared to IPF. Unlike IPF, NSIP does respond to steroids. 

• 
NSIP is almost always associated with an underlying disease. NSIP is the most common 


pulmonary manifestation in patients with collagen vascular disease. NSIP may be associated with dermatomyositis, SLE, mixed connective tissue disease, and scleroderma. NSIP may also be caused by drug reaction. 
• 
Histologically, NSIP features thickened alveolar septa from chronic inflammation – in contrast to IPF/UIP. 

• 
An important imaging feature of NSIP is the presence of ground glass opacities (GGO) with peribronchial predominance which is a key feature to distinguish NSIP. 

• 
A key imaging finding (not always seen but very specific) is sparing of immediate subpleural lung. This feature is NOT seen in UIP. 

• 
Like UIP, NSIP tends to affect the lower lobes. Other diagnoses should be considered (e.g., chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis or sarcoidosis) if there is primarily upper lobe disease. 



Organizing pneumonia (OP) 

Axial CT shows patchy consolidative and ground glass opacities in a peribronchovascular distribution. There is a reverse halo or atoll sign in the right lower lobe (arrow), where a central lucency is surrounded by a peripheral opacity. 
Case courtesy Seth Kligerman, MD, University of Maryland. 
• 
Organizing pneumonia is the histological pattern of alveolar inflammation with granulation tissue polyps that fill the distal airways and alveoli. OP may be a response to infection, drug reaction, or inhalation. OP may be idiopathic or related to connective tissue disease as well. 

• 
Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) is idiopathic OP, previously called bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). 

• 
COP clinically responds to steroids with a good prognosis and may resolve completely, although recurrences are common. 

• 
CT shows consolidation or ground glass opacities in a peripheral and peribronchovascular distribution. The reverse halo sign (also known as the atoll sign) features a central lucency surrounded by a ground glass halo. Reverse halo sign is not specific but in the appropriate context is highly suggestive of OP. 


The reverse halo sign should not be confused with the halo sign that is typical of invasive aspergillus, which shows a central opacity with peripheral ground glass. 

Respiratory bronchiolitis – interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD) 

Axial CT shows innumerable subcentimeter centrilobular nodules of ground glass attenuation (arrows). None of the nodules extend to the pleural surface, which is typical of a centrilobular distribution. This was a case of respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD). 
• 
Respiratory bronchiolitis – interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD) is both the clinical syndrome and the pathologic diagnosis of this smoking-related interstitial lung disease. 

• 
Respiratory bronchiolitis (RB, without the ILD) is common in smokers, where pigmented macrophages are found in respiratory bronchioles. RB is usually asymptomatic, but if symptomatic (usually cough and shortness of breath), the clinical syndrome is called RB-ILD. 

• 
Histologically, RB-ILD is characterized by sheets of macrophages filling the terminal airways, with relative sparing of the alveoli. 

• 
The key imaging features of RB-ILD are centrilobular nodules in the lung apices. Chest: 57 



Desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) 

DIP: Axial CT shows extensive ground glass opacities. This is a nonspecific pattern. 
Case courtesy Ritu R. Gill, MD, MPH, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Like RB-ILD, desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) is both the clinical syndrome and the pathologic diagnosis. Pathologically, RB, RB-ILD, and DIP represent a continuous spectrum of smoking-related lung disease. 

• 
Like RB, brown-pigmented macrophages are involved in DIP; however, sheets of these abnormal macrophages also extend into the alveoli in DIP. 

• 
Imaging of DIP shows diffuse basal-predominant ground glass opacification. Although the predominant abnormality is ground glass, a few cysts may also be present. 


Acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP) 
• 
Acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP), representing idiopathic diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), is the pathologic diagnosis seen in the clinical syndrome of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Unlike the other IIPs, AIP is the only syndrome with an acute onset and has the worst prognosis.  

• 
Two phases of AIP are recognized: early (exudative) and chronic (organizing). 

• 
The early (exudative) phase features hyaline membranes, diffuse alveolar infiltration by immune cells, and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. 



AIP (early or exudative phase): 
Axial CT shows extensive geographic ground glass attenuation. This is a nonspecific pattern and may represent pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, infection, or ARDS/AIP. 
Case courtesy Seth Kligerman, MD, University of Maryland. 
• 
The chronic (organizing) phase features alveolar wall thickening due to granulation tissue. The chronic phase usually begins one week after the initial injury. 

• 
On imaging, opacities coalesce with architectural distortion and bronchial dilation. These features will resolve over time, sometimes with residual fibrosis. 




Antigen and exposure-related lung disease 
• Most inhalational lung diseases predominantly affect the upper lobes because the lower lobes have more robust blood flow and lymphatic drainage. 
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) 
• 
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is a common lung disease caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to inhaled organic antigens, such as bird proteins or thermophilic actinomycetes, although a history of antigen exposure is not elicited in about 1/3 of patients. 

• 
HP is characterized by two clinical courses: acute/subacute and chronic. Chronic has progressive symptoms (+/- acute exacerbation) and fibrosis; acute/subacute may have recurrence but no fibrosis. 

• 
Acute/subacute HP is characterized by inflammatory exudate filling the alveoli, which manifests on imaging as nonspecific ground glass or consolidation. Small, ill-defined centrilobular nodules and ground glass can also be seen. 


Mosaic attenuation (geographic areas of relative lucency) can be secondary to mosaic perfusion on inspiration and air trapping on expiration. 

HP: Diffuse ground glass opacities affecting both lungs with mosaic attenuation. There are diffuse small centrilobular nodules (arrow). This was a case of acute/subacute HP. 
• Chronic HP, from long-term exposure to the offending antigen, leads to pulmonary fibrosis, typically but not always upper-lobe predominant. Often the findings of acute/subacute disease, including centrilobular nodules, ground glass, and mosaic attenuation, may be superimposed. 
Symptoms may follow a chronic, progressive course or present as multiple exacerbations. The key feature of chronic HP, in either case, is fibrosis. Fibrosis is typically peribronchovascular. The head-cheese sign describes the combination of patchy ground glass and areas of lucency due to air 
trapping. Unlike IPF, honeycombing is not common in HP, but when present may involve the upper lobes. 
Pneumoconioses 
• 
A pneumoconiosis is a lung disease secondary to inorganic dust inhalation. In contrast, hypersensitivity pneumonitis is caused by organic dust inhalation. 

• 
Silicosis and coal workers pneumoconiosis (CWP) are the two most common pneumoconioses. They have indistinguishable imaging findings even though they are due to different inhaled dusts and have different histologic findings. Imaging features also overlap with sarcoidosis. 


Silicosis is due to inhalation of silica dust, which miners may be exposed to. CWP is caused by inhalation of coal dust, which does not contain any silica. The most characteristic finding of uncomplicated disease is multiple upper-lobe predominant 
perilymphatic nodules. Eggshell lymph node calcifications are commonly seen in silicosis, less commonly in CWP. Silicosis or CWP can become complicated with large conglomerate masses or progressive massive fibrosis. 

Both silicosis and CWP confer an increased risk of TB. Caplan syndrome is seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and either CWP or silicosis (more common in CWP) and represents necrobiotic rheumatoid nodules superimposed on the smaller centrilobular and subpleural nodules of the pneumoconiosis. 
• Asbestosis is lung disease caused by inhalation of asbestos fibers. End-stage asbestosis can lead to pulmonary fibrosis with a UIP pathology. 
Unlike the other inhalational lung diseases, asbestosis predominantly affects the lower lobes because the asbestos particles are too large to be removed by the alveolar macrophages and lymphatic system. The radiographic/CT appearance and distribution of advanced asbestosis may be indistinguishable from 
IPF; however, an important clue seen in asbestosis is pleural thickening and plaques. Even though pleural plaques (which may or may not be calcified) are due to asbestos exposure, they are not a component of asbestosis, do not lead to fibrosis, and are usually asymptomatic. 


Eosinophilic lung disease 
• Eosinophilic lung disease is a spectrum of diseases that feature accumulation of eosinophils in the pulmonary airspaces and interstitium. 
Simple pulmonary eosinophilia (Löffler syndrome) 
• 
Simple pulmonary eosinophilia (also known as Löffler syndrome) is characterized by transient and migratory areas of focal consolidation, with an elevated eosinophil count in the peripheral smear. 

• 
An identical appearance can be seen as a response to injury, especially with parasitic disease and drug reactions. The term simple pulmonary eosinophilia is reserved for idiopathic cases. 


Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia 

Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia: Chest radiograph demonstrates upper lobe and peripheral consolidation. Axial CT shows bilateral patchy peripheral consolidative opacities. 
Case courtesy Ritu R. Gill, MD, MPH, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia is an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of chronic consolidation. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia causes extensive alveolar filling and interstitial infiltration with inflammatory eosinophils. 

• 
Consolidation is patchy and peripheral, with an upper lobe predominance, in a reverse batwing configuration. Furthermore, consolidation may cross fissures, distinguishing it from COP. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia is also much less common than COP. 

• 
Compare to prior films for transient or changing infiltrates over time. 

• 
Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia responds rapidly to steroids but relapse is common after steroid discontinuation. Patients almost always have peripheral blood eosinophilia. 



Pulmonary vasculitis 
• 
Pulmonary vasculitis includes a group of inflammatory conditions involving small vessels, large vessels, and granulomatous disease. 

• 
Imaging manifestations include 1) alveolar hemorrhage and 2) nodular foci with cavitation. 



Alveolar hemorrhage due to ANCA-associated microscopic polyangiitis: Axial CT shows basal predominant central ground glass with associated mild interlobular septal thickening. This patient had renal insufficiency and had a P-ANCA positive vasculitis with alveolar hemorrhage. 
• Microscopic polyangiitis is the most common cause of pulmonary hemorrhage with rapidly 
progressive renal failure as part of the pulmonary-renal syndrome. P-ANCA is positive. Alveolar hemorrhage only occurs in about 20–30% of patients. Imaging shows diffuse central-predominant ground glass opacities due to hemorrhage. 
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), previously called Wegener granulomatosis (WG) 
• 
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a systemic small-vessel vasculitis with a classic clinical triad of sinusitis, lung involvement, and renal insufficiency. C-ANCA is positive. 

• 
In the upper airways, GPA may cause nasopharyngeal and eustachian tube obstruction. Involvement of the larynx and bronchi is common, leading to airway stenosis, most commonly subglottic. 

• 
In the lungs, GPA may cause multiple nodules often with ground glass halo in the acute setting. The nodules may cavitate as well. 




Chest radiograph shows numerous cavitary lesions bilaterally (arrows). 
Coronal and axial CT confirms multiple thick-walled cavitary lesions (arrows). The primary differential consideration would be septic emboli; however, this patient was C-ANCA positive.

Iatrogenic lung disease 
Drug toxicity 
• 
The lung has a diverse but finite repertoire of responses to injury, including pulmonary edema (due to increased capillary permeability), ARDS, organizing pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, bronchiolitis obliterans, pulmonary hemorrhage, NSIP, and UIP. 

• 
Pulmonary drug reaction, most commonly to cytotoxic drugs, may elicit any of these injury responses. 


Radiation lung injury 
• Up to 40% of patients develop radiographic abnormalities after external radiotherapy, although most patients are asymptomatic. The radiographic abnormality is often but not always confined to the radiation port, usually with non-anatomic linear margins. 

Acute radiation pneumonitis: Coronal and axial CT demonstrate geographic left upper lung ground glass (arrows) with non-anatomic superior and lateral linear margins. Radiation-associated findings may cross fissures. Case courtesy Ritu R. Gill, MD, MPH, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Radiation pneumonitis is the early stage of radiation injury, which can occur within one month of radiotherapy and is most severe 3–4 months after treatment. Radiation pneumonitis features ground glass centered on the radiation port, although extension out of the port is relatively common. 

• 
Radiation fibrosis is the late stage of radiation injury. Fibrosis becomes apparent approximately 6–12 months after therapy. The key imaging finding is the distribution of fibrosis and traction bronchiectasis within the radiation port, although fibrosis may extend outside the port in 20%. 



Radiation fibrosis: Chest radiograph and enhanced CT shows paramediastinal fibrotic changes within the radiation port. Despite radiation, the patient has persistent left mediastinal adenopathy (arrow). 


Idiopathic systemic diseases affecting the lungs 
Sarcoidosis 
• 
Sarcoidosis is an idiopathic systemic disorder of noncaseating granulomas that become coalescent to form nodules and masses throughout the body. 

• 
Pulmonary sarcoidosis may progress to pulmonary fibrosis. Unlike IPF (the most common cause of pulmonary fibrosis), the fibrotic changes of sarcoid have a mid and upper-lung predominance, similar to end-stage hypersensitivity pneumonitis. 

• 
A historical staging system has been used for radiographic findings (not CT) in sarcoidosis; however, patients do not necessarily progress through the stages. 


Stage 0: Normal radiograph. Stage 1: Hilar or mediastinal adenopathy only, without lung changes. Stage 2: Adenopathy with lung changes. Stage 3: Diffuse lung disease without adenopathy. Stage 4: End-stage fibrosis. 
• While the most common radiographic finding in sarcoidosis is symmetric adenopathy, sarcoid does NOT ALWAYS present with lymphadenopathy, and can be present without lymph node enlargement. Lymph nodes may contain stippled or eggshell calcification in up to 50%. 

Stage 1 sarcoidosis: Frontal (left image) and lateral radiographs show symmetric adenopathy 
demonstrating the 1-2-3 sign:      Right paratracheal adenopathy (yellow arrows, “1”)     Right hilar adenopathy (red arrow, “2”)      Left hilar adenopathy (red arrow, “3”) 
The lateral radiograph demonstrates the donut sign with adenopathy circumferentially encircling the airways (arrows). 
The lung parenchyma is normal. 

Sarcoidosis: Axial CT in a different patient shows peripherally-calcified ("eggshell") lymph nodes (arrows). 
Case courtesy Ritu R. Gill, MD, MPH, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• The most common CT finding in sarcoidosis, in addition to adenopathy, is upper-lobe predominant perilymphatic nodules of variable sizes, representing sarcoid granulomas. 


CT in a different patient with sarcoidosis shows slightly larger nodules in a peribronchovascular distribution. 

Coronal CT demonstrates upper-lobe predominant progressive massive fibrosis of sarcoid, with the galaxy sign – an area composed of numerous smaller granulomas resembling a galaxy. 
• 
Perilymphatic nodules are found along the course of the pulmonary lymphatics, which are peribronchovascular, subpleural, and within the interlobular septa. Septal thickening may occur but is uncommon in sarcoid. 

• 
Perilymphatic nodules may coalesce into a mass up to several centimeters in diameter. The 


galaxy sign is seen when small nodules are peripheral to a nodule or mass. Nodules may occasionally be miliary. Diffuse micronodules may simulate ground glass. 
• 
Fibrotic sarcoid affects predominantly the upper lobes and can produce progressive massive fibrosis just as seen in pneumoconioses. 

• 
Bronchial involvement may cause mosaic perfusion due to air trapping. 

• 
Sarcoidosis may involve other organs, including the spleen, brain, and rarely bone. 



Axial contrast-enhanced CT through the liver and spleen in a patient with sarcoidosis shows innumerable small hypoattenuating splenic nodules.

Miscellaneous diffuse pulmonary disease 
Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) 
• 
Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is an idiopathic disease causing filling of the alveoli with a proteinaceous lipid-rich material. 

• 
On chest radiography, PAP may resemble pulmonary edema with perihilar opacification; however, the heart is normal in size in PAP and pleural effusions are not typically seen. 

• 
The CT hallmark of PAP is the crazy paving pattern of smooth interlobular septal thickening in areas of patchy or geometric ground glass. Although initially described for PAP, the crazy paving pattern is not specific for PAP, as described at the beginning of the chapter. 



Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis:  CT shows ground glass opacification with interlobular septal thickening representing the crazy paving pattern. 
• 
Patients with PCP are susceptible to superimposed infection, classically with Nocardia, which typically presents as a consolidation. 

• 
Treatment of PAP is whole lung bronchoalveolar lavage. 



Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis with superimposed Nocardia: 
CT shows bilateral crazy paving predominantly in the right lung, with a dense consolidative opacity in the left upper lobe (arrow) representing superimposed Nocardia pneumonia.

Cystic Lung Disease 
Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH) 


Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis: Chest radiograph shows multiple upper-lobe predominant cysts with the suggestion of multiple small nodules. There is a moderate left pneumothorax (yellow arrow). 
CT confirms the pneumothorax (yellow arrow) but more clearly delineates the upper-lobe predominant cysts (better seen in the top right image) and nodules (bottom left image, red arrows). 
Case courtesy Ritu R. Gill, MD, MPH, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH) is a smoking-related lung disease – nearly 
100% of adults with PLCH are smokers. The other smoking-related interstitial lung diseases (aside from emphysema) are RB-ILD and DIP. Multiple smoking-related lung diseases may be present simultaneously. 
• 
PLCH may present as a spontaneous pneumothorax. 

• 
Disease in adults is most often isolated to the lungs; however, lucent bone lesions, diabetes insipidus from inflammation of the pituitary stalk (hypophysitis), and skin involvement can occasionally be seen. 


In addition to LCH, the differential diagnosis for diseases affecting the lungs and bones includes malignancy, tuberculosis, fungal disease (including Blastomycosis, Histoplasmosis, and Coccidiodomycosis), sarcoidosis, and Gaucher disease (pulmonary involvement is rare and may resemble DIP). 
• 
The first detectable abnormality is nodules associated with airways. As the disease progresses, the nodules cavitate and resultant irregular cysts predominate. 

• 
The natural progression is from nodules . cavitary nodules . irregular cysts. 

• 
At any point in time, a patient may have nodules only; nodules + cysts; or cysts only. 

• 
Radiographic and CT findings include upper-lobe predominant cysts and irregular peribronchovascular nodules, both sparing the costophrenic sulci. 


The cheerio sign in LCH refers to pulmonary nodules with a central lucent cavity supplied by a patent bronchus on CT imaging. 
• Smoking cessation is critical for stopping the progression of PLCH. However, the cysts will not resolve. 
Chest: 67 
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) 


Two separate patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis: 
Patient 1 (top radiograph and top CT) has end-stage LAM with severe cystic change and moderate right pneumothorax. 
Patient 2 (bottom left CT) shows a less severe stage of disease, with multiple smooth-walled cysts and bilateral pleural effusions. Although the pleural fluid was not sampled in this case, there is an association of LAM with chylous effusion. 
Case courtesy Ritu R. Gill, MD, MPH, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a diffuse cystic lung disease caused by bronchiolar obstruction and lung destruction due to proliferation of immature smooth muscle cells in small vessels, lymphatics, and bronchioles. 

• 
Approximately 1% of patients with tuberous sclerosis (triad of seizures, mental retardation, and adenoma sebaceum) have LAM. 

• 
Sporadic LAM is seen in women of childbearing age or older; the cysts do not disappear over time. 

• 
The current treatment is mTOR inhibitors. 

• 
LAM is associated with pneumothorax and chylous pleural effusion. 

• 
CT of LAM shows numerous thin-walled lung cysts. In contrast to LCH, the cysts tend to be round and regular. Also, LAM affects the lungs diffusely while LCH is upper-lobe predominant. 


Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP) 
• 
Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP) is both a clinical syndrome and the pathologic diagnosis. LIP is exceptionally rare as an isolated idiopathic disease and is most commonly associated with connective tissue disease (Sjögren syndrome), though also can be seen with HIV or CVID.  

• 
The histologic hallmark of LIP is diffuse infiltration of the interstitium by lymphocytes and other immune cells, with resultant distortion of the alveoli. 

• 
LIP imaging most commonly presents with cysts and nodules, though cysts alone, nodules alone, ground glass, or interlobular septal thickening may also be seen. The scattered thin-walled perivascular cysts are thought to be due to air trapping. LIP may be complicated by pneumothorax in advanced disease. 



LIP: Unenhanced axial CT shows patchy ground glass opacities, scattered perivascular cysts, and a right-sided pneumothorax. 
Case courtesy Ritu R. Gill, MD, MPH, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 

Birt-Hogg Dube syndrome (BHD) 
• 
Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the folliculin (FLCN) gene on chromosome 17p11.2. 

• 
The syndrome is characterized by fibrofolliculomas (noncancerous skin lesions), renal tumors (most common chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and renal oncocytoma), and renal and pulmonary cysts. Spontaneous pneumothoraces can occur as sequelae of pulmonary cysts. 

• 
Imaging findings include lower lung predominant cysts which are often subpleural or perivascular, with a polygonal or “floppy” shape.
