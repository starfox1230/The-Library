Pleura 
Pleural malignancy 
Metastatic disease 
• 
Metastatic disease is the most common cause of pleural malignancy. 

• 
Lung and breast cancer, gastrointestinal and genitourinary adenocarcinoma, and invasive thymoma can metastasize to the pleura. 



Chest wall metastases: Axial CT image shows a heterogeneously enhancing mass invading the chest wall and adjacent pleural of the left lung. This was a case of breast cancer metastasis. 
Features to help differentiate malignant pleural effusions 
• 
Unexplained recurrent pleural effusions should raise suspicion for underlying malignancy regardless of associated visualized pleural nodularity. 

• 
The split pleura sign is characteristic of an empyema, formed by fibrin coating both parietal and visceral pleuras resulting in in-growth of blood vessels. Although rare, empyema can be seen in lung cancer. 

• 
Features of malignant effusion include: 


Nodular pleural thickening. Large or recurrent effusion without etiology. Thickening of mediastinal (medial) pleura. 

Multiple myeloma/plasmacytoma 
• Osseous metastases may have soft tissue components that are extrapleural, which may secondarily invade the pleura.

Mesothelioma 

Mesothelioma: Contrast-enhanced CT through the thorax (left image) shows extensive nodular pleural thickening of the left hemithorax (arrows). Images through the upper abdomen show extensive soft tissue abnormality with invasion of the chest wall (arrows). 

Mesothelioma (in different patient from above): Axial (left image) and coronal T1-weighted post-contrast fat-suppressed MR images demonstrate circumferential nodular thickening of the left pleura. 
• 
Mesothelioma is a highly aggressive neoplasm arising from the pleura. Most cases are due to prior asbestos exposure, with a latency of >20 years. 

• 
The epithelial subtype is more common and has a slightly better prognosis. Sarcomatoid and mixed subtypes are more aggressive. 

• 
CT of mesothelioma typically shows nodular concentric pleural thickening, often with an associated pleural effusion. 

• 
The role of surgery is evolving, with the goal to resect all visible tumor. Trimodality therapy involving surgery, intraoperative heated chemotherapy, and radiation has been shown to provide benefit for a subset of patients.

Fibrous tumor of the pleura (FTP) 
• 
Fibrous tumor of the pleura (FTP), also known as solitary fibrous tumor, is a focal pleural mass not related to asbestos or mesothelioma. It is not mesothelial in origin. 

• 
Approximately 20–30% of FTP are malignant, so all are excised. Malignant potential is determined by number of mitoses seen at pathology. 

• 
FTP may be associated with hypoglycemia or hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy, although these associated conditions are uncommon (5%). 

• 
FTP may be pedunculated. A pleural-based mass that changes position is suggestive of FTP. FTP tends to have low FDG uptake on PET. 



Fibrous tumor of the pleura: CT topogram (left image) shows a round opacity (arrow) with a circumscribed medial margin and indistinct lateral margin, suggesting a pleural-based mass. CT confirms that the mass (arrow) is pleural-based, with a broad attachment to the pleura.

Pleural effusion 
Transudate 
• A transudative effusion is caused by systemic or local imbalances in hydrostatic and oncotic forces. Common causes include systemic low-protein states, heart failure, and nephrotic syndrome. 

Exudate 
• 
An exudative effusion is distinguished from a transudate by thoracentesis. There are no reliable imaging features to distinguish between transudative and exudative effusions. 

• 
The presence of an exudate implies pleural disease causing increased permeability of pleural capillaries, which may be due to: 


Pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion, empyema, or tuberculous pleuritis. Mesothelioma or pleural metastasis. Rheumatoid arthritis or other collagen vascular diseases. 

Chylothorax 
• 
A chylothorax is a pleural effusion consisting of intestinal lymph, most commonly caused by iatrogenic injury, less commonly neoplastic obstruction of the thoracic duct. Chylothorax is also associated with lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). 

• 
The thoracic duct originates at the cisterna chyli in the upper abdomen and drains into the left brachiocephalic or subclavian vein.
