Interlobar fi ssures 
• 
The minor fissure separates the right upper lobe (RUL) from the right middle lobe (RML) and is seen on both the frontal and lateral views as a fine horizontal line. 

• 
The major (oblique) fissures are seen only on the lateral radiograph as oblique lines. However, if they are fluid-filled, the major fissures can be seen on the frontal view as concave curvilinear opacities in the lateral hemithorax. 


On the right, the major fissure separates the RUL and RML from the right lower lobe. On the left, the major fissure separates the left upper lobe (LUL) from the left lower lobe (LLL). 
Accessory fi ssures 
• 
The azygos fissure is an accessory fissure present in less than 1% of patients, seen in the presence of an azygos lobe. An azygos lobe is an anatomic variant where a portion of the apical right upper lobe is encased in its own parietal and visceral pleura. 

• 
The superior accessory fissure is seen in approximately 5% of patients and separates the superior and basal segments of the right lower lobe. 

• 
The inferior accessory fissure is seen in approximately 12% of patients, more commonly in the right lung, and divides the medial basal segment from the other basal segments. 

• 
The left minor fissure is present in approximately 8% of patients and separates the lingula from the left upper lobe. 

• 
Atelectasis is loss of lung volume due to decreased aeration. Atelectasis is synonymous with collapse. Atelectasis may be caused by bronchial obstruction, mucus plugging, or external compression (e.g., by small lung volumes or pleural effusions). 

• 
Direct signs of atelectasis are from lobar volume loss and include: 

• 
Indirect signs of atelectasis are due to the effect of volume loss on adjacent structures and include: 



Elevation of the diaphragm. 
Overinflation of adjacent or contralateral lobes. 
Rib crowding on the side with volume loss. 
Hilar displacement. 
Mediastinal shift to the side with volume loss. 
• Air bronchograms are not seen in atelectasis when the cause of the atelectasis is central bronchial obstruction, but air bronchograms can be seen in atelectasis caused by external compression. 


Mechanisms of atelectasis 
• Obstructive atelectasis occurs when alveolar gas is absorbed by blood circulating through alveolar capillaries but is not replaced by inspired air due to bronchial obstruction. 
Obstructive atelectasis can cause lobar atelectasis, which is complete collapse of a lobe, discussed on the following pages. Obstructive atelectasis occurs more quickly when the patient is breathing supplemental oxygen since 
oxygen is absorbed from the alveoli more rapidly than nitrogen. 
In children, airway obstruction is most often due to an aspirated foreign object. In contrast to adults, the affected side becomes hyperexpanded in children due to a ball-valve effect. Subsegmental atelectasis is a subtype of obstructive atelectasis commonly seen after surgery or general 
illness, due to mucus obstruction of the small airways. 
• 
Relaxation (passive) atelectasis is caused by relaxation of lung adjacent to an intrathoracic lesion causing mass effect, such as a pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary mass. 

• 
Adhesive atelectasis is due to surfactant deficiency. 


Adhesive atelectasis is seen most commonly in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, but can also be seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 
• Cicatricial atelectasis is volume loss from architectural distortion of lung parenchyma by fibrosis. 


Lobar atelectasis 
• Lobar atelectasis is usually caused by central bronchial obstruction (obstructive atelectasis), 
which may be secondary to mucus plugging or an obstructing neoplasm. If the lobar atelectasis occurs acutely, mucus plugging is the most likely cause. Mucus plugging is most common in the lower lobes, least common in the left upper lobe. If lobar atelectasis is seen in an outpatient, an obstructing central tumor must be ruled out. 
• Lobar atelectasis, or collapse of an entire lobe, has characteristic appearances depending on which of the five lobes is collapsed, as discussed on the following pages.

   Illustration showing direction of collapse for each of the five lobes. 

Left  upper lobe collapse and luftsichel sign: Frontal radiograph (left image) shows veil-like opacity with obscured left cardiac margin, a characteristic finding of left upper lobe collapse on frontal view; note the crescent of air lateral to the aortic arch representing the luftsichel sign (yellow arrow). The lateral view (right image) shows the anterior displacement of the left major fissure and collapsed left upper lobe (red arrows). 
• 
Key imaging findings include the veil-like opacity on frontal radiograph, anterior displacement of major fissure and anterior collapsed lung on lateral radiograph. 

• 
The luftsichel (air-sickle in German) sign is a crescent of air seen on the frontal radiograph, which represents the interface between the aorta and the hyperexpanded superior segment of the left lower lobe. However, this sign is not always present. 

• 
It is important to recognize left upper lobe collapse and not mistake the left lung opacity for pneumonia or pleural effusion, since a mass obstructing the airway may be the cause of the lobar atelectasis. 


Right upper lobe atelectasis 

Right upper lobe collapse: Frontal radiograph (left image) shows a right upper lobe opacity with superior displacement of the minor fissure (blue arrow) and a convex mass (Golden S sign; yellow arrow). Lateral radiograph (right image) shows the wedge-shaped collapsed RUL projecting superiorly (red arrows). 
• 
The reverse S sign of Golden is seen in right upper lobe collapse caused by an obstructing mass. The central convex margins of the mass form a reverse S. Although the sign describes a reverse S, it is also commonly known as the Golden S sign. Similar to left upper lobe collapse, a right upper lobe collapse should raise concern for an underlying malignancy in adults or mucus plugging, particularly common in children. 

• 
The juxtaphrenic peak sign is a peridiaphragmatic triangular opacity caused by 


diaphragmatic traction from an inferior accessory fissure or an inferior pulmonary ligament, seen in upper lobe volume loss from any cause. 
Left lower lobe atelectasis 

Left  lower lobe collapse: Frontal radiographs demonstrate a triangular retrocardiac opacity representing the collapsed left lower lobe (yellow arrows). Lateral radiograph shows posterior hazy opacity (red arrows). 
• 
Triangular retrocardiac opacity is the main imaging feature of left lower lobe collapse. 

• 
The .at waist sign describes the flattening of the left heart border due to posterior shift of hilar structures and resultant cardiac rotation. 


Right lower lobe atelectasis 

Right lower lobe collapse: Frontal radiograph shows a triangular opacity at the right lower zone with apex pointing towards the right hilum and obscuration of the medial right hemidiaphragm (blue arrow). Note there is preservation of the right heart border. Lateral radiograph shows a hazy posterior opacity of the collapsed right lower lobe (red arrows). 
• 
Right lower lobe atelectasis is the mirror-image of left lower lobe atelectasis. Lower lobe collapse is not well-seen on lateral view since the lobes mostly collapse medially. 

• 
The collapsed lower lobe appears as a triangular retrocardiac opacity. 



Right middle lobe atelectasis: Frontal chest radiograph shows an indistinct opacity in the right lung with focal silhouetting of the right heart border (blue arrows). There is elevation of the right hemidiaphragm due to volume loss. The lateral radiograph shows a triangular opacity (red arrow) projecting over the mid-heart representing the collapsed right middle lobe. 
• 
The findings of right middle lobe atelectasis can be subtle on the frontal radiograph. Silhouetting of the right heart border by the collapsed medial segment of the middle lobe may be the only clue. The lateral radiograph shows a triangular opacity anteriorly. 

• 
Collapse of both right middle and lower lobes occurs from obstruction of the bronchus intermedius, and it causes obscuration of both the right heart border and right hemidiaphragm, with a linear superior margin directed towards the hilum. 



Round atelectasis 
• 
Round atelectasis is focal atelectasis with a round morphology that is always associated with an adjacent pleural abnormality (e.g., pleural effusion, pleural thickening or plaque). 

• 
Round atelectasis is most common in the posterior lower lobes. 

• 
All five of the following findings must be present to diagnose round atelectasis: 


1) Adjacent pleura must be abnormal. 
2) Opacity must be peripheral and in contact with the pleura.
