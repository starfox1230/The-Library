Paget-Schroetter syndrome 

Coronal contrast-enhanced MR venography with arms Diagnostic venography confirms complete occlusion abducted demonstrates right subclavian vein thrombus of the right subclavian vein (arrow) with complete (arrow). The MRI did not demonstrate a mechanical lack of opacification of the SVC and the formation of cause for the thrombosis. numerous collaterals. 


• 
Paget-Schroetter syndrome is compression and thrombosis of the subclavian vein as it enters the thorax and is usually seen in muscular young men. Chronic compression causes intimal hyperplasia, which leads to subclavian vein thrombosis. Paget-Schroetter syndrome clinically presents with upper-extremity swelling or pain worsened with effort. 

• 
During diagnostic venography, it is necessary to evaluate the arm both in neutral position and abducted. Both sides should be evaluated. Frequently, both subclavian veins are compressed, even if only one side is symptomatic. 

• 
Treatment is thrombolysis, then subsequently surgical thoracic outlet decompression. 

• 
If there is residual stenosis following thrombolysis, surgical decompression should generally be performed prior to angioplasty. However, if pre-procedure imaging demonstrated no mechanical cause, then angioplasty can be performed, as in the case above. 

• 
Stents should generally not be used, especially if there is a mechanical obstruction, due to high risk of device failure. 


Nutcracker syndrome 
• 
Nutcracker syndrome is compression of the left renal vein between the aorta and the SMA. 

• 
Clinical presentations are variable, including pain, hematuria, orthostatic proteinuria, pelvic congestion, and varicocele (in a male). The term Nutcracker phenomenon is used when the patient is asymptomatic. 

• 
There is a lack of established treatment guidelines. Prolonged observation with or without medical management is preferred, as the majority of cases of hematuria resolve spontaneously within two years. Endovascular treatments (angioplasty and stenting of the renal vein) and surgical options (most commonly left renal vein transposition) are also available. 


May-Thurner syndrome 

May-Thurner syndrome: A patient with two months of left lower extremity pain was found to have extensive clot burden extending from the left internal iliac vein to the left popliteal vein. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) revealed severe venous compression of the left iliac vein by the right iliac artery with reduced cross-sectional area (top left image). Percutaneous venoplasty (bottom left image) and stenting (bottom right image) across the left iliac vein were performed. After stenting, IVUS revealed good wall apposition and improved cross-sectional area (top right image). 
• 
May-Thurner syndrome is venous thrombosis of the left common iliac vein caused by compression from the crossing right common iliac artery. Both genders are equally affected. 

• 
Chronic compression leads to fibrous adhesions, intimal proliferation, and spur formation along the vein wall, predisposing to thrombosis. 

• 
Conventional venography with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is gold standard for diagnosis. 

• 
Treatment is initial catheter-directed thrombolysis to treat acute thrombus, followed by stenting. Self-expanding stents are preferred. 

• 
Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) can occur in up to half of all patients who have DVT and is a costly, burdensome complication. PTS consists of edema, pain, ulceration, discoloration, and varicose veins. 


Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome 
• 
Acute obstruction of the SVC causes SVC syndrome, which clinically presents as facial and upper extremity edema and cyanosis. Acute SVC syndrome is a vascular emergency. 

• 
In contrast to acute SVC syndrome, chronic occlusion or stenosis of the SVC may be asymptomatic. If symptoms are present, facial edema that improves with standing is characteristic. 

• 
The most common causes of SVC obstruction are compression by thoracic malignancy, catheter-associated thrombosis, and mediastinal fibrosis after histoplasmosis exposure. 

• 
A classic cross-sectional abdominal imaging finding in SVC obstruction is increased enhancement of hepatic segment IVa due to collateral opacification of the vein of Sappey. 


The vein of Sappey drains the liver in the region of the falciform ligament and communicates with internal thoracic veins, which act as collateral vessels in the setting of SVC occlusion. 
• Combined internal jugular and femoral approaches may be necessary for treatment of SVC occlusion. Stenting is often necessary. 

SVC syndrome in a patient with small cell lung cancer: Superior vena cava venogram (left image) shows lack of contrast opacification in the SVC with irregular tapering of the right brachiocephalic vein (arrow). After placement of a 15 mm x 5 cm Gianturco-Rosch stent (right image, arrows) in the area of obstruction, normal flow is restored. 

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement 
• 
The purpose of an IVC filter is to reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) originating from a lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Indications for filter placement include DVT and contraindication to anticoagulation; recurrent PE while anticoagulated; and high risk of developing DVT/PE in a patient with contraindication to anticoagulation, such as a multi-trauma patient. 

• 
The most common complication of IVC filter placement is access site thrombosis, followed by IVC thrombosis. IVC perforation occurs not uncommonly, but is almost always inconsequential. Filter fracture or embolization are rare. 

• 
The first step of the procedure is an inferior vena cavogram, performed with a high-flow (pigtail) catheter. The cavogram guides the selection of filter type and placement location. 

• 
If a duplicated IVC is present, in order to prevent a clot from circumnavigating the filter, either a single filter is placed above the IVC confluence or a filter is placed in each duplicated 


IVC. If pre-procedural imaging is not available, a clue to the presence of a duplicated IVC on initial cavography is the absence of iliac vein influx contralateral to the side injected. 

Duplicated IVC: Pre-procedure contrast-enhanced CT (left image) shows duplicated IVCs on either side of the aorta (arrows). The presence of duplicated IVCs is confirmed by cavography of the left IVC (bottom left image), where the left renal vein (arrow) drains into the left IVC. 
Post-procedure radiograph (bottom right image) shows the IVC filter (arrow at filter tip) placed above the confluence of the duplicated IVC.

• Most IVC filters are suitable for vessel diameters smaller than 28–30 mm. Only the special Bird’s Nest filter can be placed in larger IVCs up to 40 mm in diameter, however it is permanent/non-retrievable. Alternatively, separate retrievable filters can be inserted in each common iliac vein in the case of a megacava (IVC diameter >30 mm).

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement (continued) 
• The preferred location of the IVC filter is immediately inferior to the lowest renal vein, including any variant renal veins (circumaortic or retroaortic). Placement inferior to the lowest renal vein prevents the anomalous vein from acting as a conduit for clot propagation. Circumaortic left renal vein is an anatomic variant seen in 2–10% of the population, where the left renal vein is composed of two separate components. One component passes anterior to the aorta (the normal configuration) and a second retroaortic component passes posterior to the aorta to meet the IVC. 
Retroaortic left renal vein is a slightly less common variant (seen in 2–7% of the population), where a single renal vein passes posterior to the aorta. A retroaortic left renal vein usually joins the IVC more inferiorly than the right renal vein. 

Retroaortic left renal vein: Initial digital subtraction inferior vena cavography (left image) shows the left renal vein (yellow arrow) entering the IVC markedly inferior to the right renal vein (red arrow), indicating that the left renal vein is likely retroaortic. Post-procedure radiograph shows the filter tip placed a few mm inferior to the confluence of the left retroaortic renal vein, indicated by the ruler (top of the filter at 148; retroaortic left renal vein at 152).

Interruption of the IVC with azygous continuation is a rare anomaly where blood from the lower IVC flows into the azygous and hemiazygous veins, into the thorax, and then into the right atrium. Interruption of the IVC with azygous continuation is associated with polysplenia and congenital heart disease. It is caused by embryologic failure of the right subcardinal vein to join the intrahepatic venous complex. 
• The presence of preexisting IVC thrombus may interfere with the positioning of IVC filter, requiring higher than normal placement. 


Venous thromboembolic disease 
Phlegmasia cerulea dolens (PCD) 
• 
PCD is a vascular emergency consisting of acute limb swelling, cyanosis and severe pain that occurs due to complete thrombotic occlusion of venous drainage of a limb. PCD occurs most often in the setting of malignancy, trauma, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or other prothrombotic state. 

• 
Massive limb swelling, hypertension in the capillary bed, and eventually ischemia and gangrene can occur if untreated. 

• 
PCD requires anticoagulation with IV heparin and treatment with angioplasty, catheter-directed thrombolysis, or surgical thrombectomy. 


Ovarian and pelvic vein embolization 

Pelvic venous congestion syndrome: Left gonadal vein venogram shows reflux of contrast to the level of the left renal vein (left image, arrow). Platinum coils were deployed, followed by embolization with 1% sodium tetradecyl sulfate (right image, arrow). 
• 
Ovarian vein reflux (i.e., pelvic venous congestion syndrome) is a common cause of chronic pelvic pain and most commonly affects multiparous women. 

• 
The left gonadal vein is typically affected due to the acute angle it makes with the IVC, predisposing it to reflux. 

• 
Minimally invasive embolization has shown excellent treatment efficacy. Rare complications include migration of coils to the pulmonary artery, thrombophlebitis, and pain. 

• 
Via internal jugular or femoral vein access, venography of the internal iliac veins and left renal vein are performed to assess for reflux or stenosis. If the valves are incompetent during Valsalva, reflux will be seen, often with collateralization and reflux to contralateral pelvic veins. 

• 
A combination of liquid embolic agent, foam sclerotherapy, metallic coils, or vascular plug can be used. The use of metallic coils alone has fallen out of favor due to high recurrence rate with this method. 

• 
Metallic coils are deployed in the inferior ovarian vein, usually at the level of the inguinal canal. Liquid embolic is then injected above the site of occlusion. A repeat venogram is then done to confirm resolution of reflux. 


Varicocele embolization 

• 
A varicocele is a collection of varicose veins in the pampiniform plexus. Primary varicocele (most common) is due to absent or incompetent valves in the proximal gonadal vein causing reflux. Secondary varicocele is due to a mass obstructing venous return. 

• 
Varicoceles are usually seen on the left side due to the acute angle of insertion on the renal vein, predisposing it to reflux, but can be bilateral. However, an isolated right varicocele should prompt workup for an obstructing retroperitoneal mass. 

• 
Diagnosis by scrotal ultrasound shows a dilated (>2 mm) venous plexus with a bag of worms appearance, which worsens on Valsalva maneuver. 

• 
Indications for treatment are pain, infertility, or testicular atrophy. 

• 
Treatment is coil embolization or surgical ligation of the gonadal vein, which have been shown to be equivalent in outcome. 

• 
Right femoral vein or right internal jugular vein access is preferred for a left-sided varicocele; internal jugular vein or basilic vein access is preferred for a right-sided varicocele.  


Lower extremity venous insufficiency 
• 
Lower extremity venous insufficiency most commonly results from venous hypertension secondary to incompetent valves but can also be seen following prior DVT. 

• 
Various treatment options are available, including thermal endovascular ablation with either laser or radiofrequency, or non-thermal ablation by injection of sclerosing agents into the vessels. Thermal and non-thermal interventions work by damaging the endothelium, causing the vessels to fibrose and resulting in irreversible occlusion. 

• 
Thermal ablation procedures require tumescent anesthesia, which is injection of a mixture of lidocaine, saline, and epinephrine into the subcutaneous tissue surrounding the treated vessel. The injection acts as a local anesthetic, but also as a heat sink, protecting the overlying skin by preventing skin burns.  

• 
Commonly treated vessels are the great saphenous vein (GSV), small saphenous vein (SSV), anterior accessory great saphenous vein (AAGSV), and their tributaries. 

• 
Sclerotherapy is the injection of a chemical irritant into the vessel, usually for small or superficial venous disease, but can also be used for perforators or deep veins, and results in ablation of the vessel(s). 

• 
Post-procedure management includes compression stockings for all of the above options.
