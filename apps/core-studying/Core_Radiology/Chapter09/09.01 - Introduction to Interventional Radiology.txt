Introduction to interventional radiology 
Pre-procedure preparation 
General 
• 
Pre-procedure patient evaluation and planning is imperative for all interventional radiology (IR) procedures. 

• 
Consultations should include a directed history and physical examination, discussion of the procedure including risks and benefits, formal signed consent, and address any safety concerns. 


Anesthesia type 
• 
There are three main categories of anesthesia for procedures. Patient factors and preference as well as invasiveness of the procedure determine which type is used. 

• 
Local anesthetic: Topical lidocaine injection, or topical lidocaine cream/gel. 

• 
Moderate procedural sedation: Midazolam and fentanyl IV, administered by non-anesthesiologist procedural staff under continuous monitoring. Specific antagonist agents are available for opioids (e.g., naloxone, peak effect 1–2 minutes) and benzodiazepines (e.g., flumazenil, peak effect 6–10 minutes). 

• 
Anesthesiology consultation: Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC) for deep procedural sedation or general endotracheal intubation. 


Pre-procedural fasting 
• NPO is not needed for local anesthesia. Practice guidelines from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) aim to reduce the risk of pulmonary aspiration when undergoing sedation/analgesia by fasting for 8+ hours for full meals (meats, fried or fatty foods), 6 hours for light meals (toast and clear liquids), 2 hours for clear liquids (water, juice without pulp, black coffee). 
Allergies 
• As most IR procedures use iodinated CT contrast, it is important to screen patients as part of the pre-procedure evaluation and consider prophylactic premedication treatment as indicated. Alternatively, other contrast agents such as gadolinium or barium can be considered. 

Prophylactic antibiotics 
• Variable levels of evidence exist for prophylactic antibiotics, which are generally not needed for “clean procedures” (e.g., line/port placement, angiography/angioplasty, IVC filter or stent placement), but can be considered for “clean-contaminated” (e.g., causing solid organ cell death/necrosis, TIPS), and are recommended for “dirty procedures” (e.g., those that traverse the gastrointestinal (GI), biliary or urinary tract, or known infection such as abscess). 
Procedural consent risks (not a comprehensive list) 
• 
All procedures: Infection, bleeding, target organ damage. 

• 
Sedation: Respiratory and cardiac depression, allergy. 

• 
Angiography procedures: Contrast risks, vessel damage (hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, thrombosis, dissection). 

• 
Lung procedures: Pneumothorax, systemic air embolism. 

• 
Embolization procedures: Nontarget embolization, post-embolization syndrome. 

• 
Biopsies: Nondiagnostic sample. 

• 
TACE: Hepatic failure, biloma/abscess. 



Procedural consent risks (not a comprehensive list; continued) 
• 
GI embolization procedures: Bowel infarction. 

• 
Pelvic embolization: Buttock claudication, rectal/bladder ischemia, impotence. 

• 
Biliary procedures: Biliary sepsis, bile leak. 

• 
GU procedures: Urosepsis. 

• 
IVC filter: Migration, perforation, IVC thrombosis. 

• 
Thrombolysis: Severe bleeding including cerebral hemorrhage, reperfusion syndrome, distal embolization. 

• 
Gastrostomy tube: Tube malposition (in peritoneum or colon), bowel damage. 

• 
TIPS: Hepatic failure, encephalopathy, death. 

• 
Transjugular liver biopsy: Capsular perforation (severe bleeding). 

• 
Uterine fibroid embolization: Premature menopause, reduced fertility, fibroid expulsion (submucosal). 

• 
Ablation: Collateral damage to adjacent organs (especially bowel), biliary stricture, abscess. 



Bleeding risk 
• 
Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) Consensus Guidelines in 2019 assess bleeding risk according to two general categories of procedures. 

• 
For patients on anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents, cessation for several half-lives or use 


Screening group  Procedures  
Low bleeding risk Screening PT/INR, platelet count, hemoglobin not routinely recommended. Thresholds: INR >2.0–3.0 Platelets >20 x 10./L  Catheter exchanges Arterial and venous interventions (<6 French sheath) Dialysis access interventions IVC filter placement and removal Lumbar puncture Venous access placement and removal (including ports) Thoracentesis/Paracentesis Superficial abscess drainage or biopsy Transjugular liver biopsy  
High bleeding risk Screening PT/INR, platelet count, hemoglobin is routinely recommended. Thresholds: INR >1.5–1.8 Platelets >50 x 10./L  Ablations Arterial interventions (>7 French sheath) Catheter directed thrombolysis Procedures involving new tract traversing solid organs (e.g., deep abscess drainage/biopsies, cholecystostomy, gastrostomy, nephrostomy tube placement) IVC filter removal (complex) Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt  

of reversal agents may be necessary for high bleeding risk procedures. 
Protamine sulfate is the reversal agent for heparin/enoxaparin. 
For reversal of vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin, options are IV vitamin K (minimum 6–12 hours) plus 
fresh-frozen plasma or prothrombin complex concentrates (e.g., Kcentra). The new factor Xa reversal agent andexanet alfa (AndexXa) can be used for apixaban and rivaroxaban. 
• Occasionally, bridging to shorter-acting therapy is needed in high thrombosis risk patients (e.g., heparin for anticoagulants, and cangrelor for antiplatelet agents). 

Achieving hemostasis 
• Manual compression remains the standard of care for hemostasis. Arterial puncture: Firm continuous pressure is applied for at least 15 minutes. Most recommend near-occlusive pressure for the first few minutes, then slight decrease in pressure to feel arterial flow beneath your fingers for the remainder of the hold. The arteriotomy is usually at least 1 cm above the skin access site. Release of pressure after 15 minutes should be gradual so as to not dislodge the platelet plug. If there 
is continued oozing after 15 minutes, pressure should be re-applied and avoid releasing and checking every few minutes. Venous puncture: Usually 5–10 minutes is sufficient, depending on the size of the venotomy and clotting 
status of the patient. 

• 
Closure device: Several arterial closure devices are available and may improve patient comfort, allow for early post-procedure mobility, and reduced bleeding and vascular complications. 

• 
Radial access is being done more frequently which allows for earlier ambulation with hemostasis obtained using a wrist compression device that is taken off 1–2 hours following procedure.
