Dialysis access and interventions 
Arteriovenous fistula 
• 
A surgical fistula for dialysis access provides good long-term patency (85% at two years), but requires several months to “mature” and about 30% of fistulas fail to mature. A fistula is mature when the veins have enlarged sufficiently to allow the high flow rates for dialysis. 

• 
Once mature, a fistula can remain patent even with relatively low flow rates. 

• 
The two common fistula locations are: Radial artery g cephalic vein at the wrist Brachial artery g variable veins in the forearm 

• 
Common causes of late fistula failure include venous outflow stenosis and peri-anastomotic venous stenosis. 



Polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) graft 
• 
A polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) graft is a short bridge of synthetic graft material placed surgically between an adjacent artery and vein. Grafts have only 50% patency at two years, but are able to be used sooner than fistulas. Grafts require higher flow rates to remain patent compared to fistulas. 

• 
Similar to a fistula, the most common cause of graft failure is a venous stenosis, either at the venous anastomosis or outflow vein. 


Clinical evaluation of surgical dialysis access 
• 
A pulsatile fistula with lack of thrill suggests venous outflow obstruction. 

• 
High access recirculation at dialysis suggests venous outflow stenosis. 

• 
Weak pulse and poor thrill suggests arterial inflow stenosis. 

• 
Complete absence of a pulse suggests arterial thrombosis. 

• 
A pulseless fistula suggests thrombosed fistula. 


Venous stenosis of surgical dialysis access 
• 
Venous outflow stenoses are typically treated with angioplasty, often requiring high-pressure or cutting balloons to dilate the fibrotic lesions. 

• 
The goal of the procedure is to restore a palpable thrill and pulse, or to restore the venous to brachial artery pressure ratio to less than 0.4. 


Thrombosis of surgical dialysis access 
• 
Both arteriovenous fistulas and PTFE grafts may become thrombosed. In general, PTFE grafts are simpler to declot compared to fistulas as the thrombus is usually limited to the graft. 

• 
Thrombosis is often secondary to venous stenosis, which must be treated as well. 

• 
Either pharmacologic or mechanical thrombosis can be performed. 





Central venous access 
• 
Central venous access can either be centrally inserted or peripherally inserted. There are multiple different catheter options and determining factors include type of treatment, duration, and frequency of infusions. 

• 
Common indications for central venous access include inability to obtain adequate peripheral venous access, frequent blood draws, administration of substances that are not safe to administer in peripheral veins (chemotherapy, vasopressors, TPN), hemodialysis, and plasmapheresis.  

• 
The patient is prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. The preferred vein of choice for centrally inserted catheters is the internal jugular vein, but if occluded, other neck veins like the external jugular vein can be used. Access is obtained under ultrasound guidance. 

• 
After placement, it is important to aspirate blood to confirm proper placement and to subsequently flush the catheter with heparinized saline to prevent thrombosis. 

• 
Common complications include infection, accidental arterial puncture, bleeding, and pneumothorax. 


Nontunneled catheter 
• 
Nontunneled catheters are typically placed at bedside or in the ICU setting when the patient is too unstable to travel and only local anesthesia is necessary. 

• 
Nontunneled catheters can have up to 5 lumens. Indications include the general indications for a central venous catheter, need for rapid resuscitation and pressure monitoring. 

• 
Prolonged use (weeks to months) of a nontunneled catheter at the femoral, internal jugular, or subclavian site should be avoided due to the increased risk of infection. 

• 
When no longer needed, these can be easily removed at bedside. 



Tunneled catheter 
• 
Tunneled catheters are placed in the interventional radiology suite and require conscious sedation. 

• 
The lifespan of a tunneled catheter is weeks to months, some are even used for years. 

• 
Common indications for tunneled catheters are administration of chemotherapy, TPN, plasmapheresis, and hemodialysis. 

• 
Ongoing infection or positive blood cultures are contraindications for placement. 

• 
Subcutaneous lidocaine is infused along the expected course of the catheter. The catheter cuff is typically placed 1 cm from the skin entry into the tunnel to facilitate easy removal. 

• 
Tunneled catheters can usually be removed at bedside. Care must be taken to ensure complete removal of the cuff. 

• 
If there is concern of infection, submit the tip for culture after removal. 


Subcutaneous port catheter 
• 
The lifespan of a port is months to years. 

• 
The preferred vessel of choice for the interventional radiologist is again the internal jugular vein. However, surgeons typically use the subclavian vein. 

• 
Placement requires conscious sedation and antibiotic prophylaxis. 

• 
The pocket should be snug around the port so that it does not flip. Some interventional radiologists also suture the port in place. 

• 
A port catheter should only be accessed using a Huber needle to protect the integrity of the silicone septum as a regular needle will remove a core of silicone with each puncture. 


Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement 

• 
The basilic vein, located medial and superficial to the brachial veins, is the first choice for peripherally inserted catheter (PICC) placement. The cephalic vein adds an extra curve as it joins the axillary/subclavian vein, but is generally the second choice if the basilic is not available. There is risk of damaging the median nerve with placement in a brachial vein as the median nerve lies superficial to the brachial veins. 

• 
A PICC should not be placed in a patient with chronic renal failure who may need a fistula in the future. Central access using the neck veins should be used instead. 




Fluid drainage and aspiration 
• 
Fluid collections in the body include sterile serous collections or abscesses. Conventional wisdom states that hematomas should not be drained; however, there is evidence that hematoma aspiration may lead to more rapid symptom relief. 

• 
The Seldinger technique is a common method by which a catheter is inserted over a guidewire. 

• 
The direct trocar technique can be performed safely with large superficial collections. The catheter is directly inserted into the collection with the inner stylet. The stylet is then removed and the catheter is aspirated to ensure placement in the fluid collection and to obtain the initial sample. The catheter is then coiled and locked. 

• 
Iatrogenic seeding of infection can be minimized with sterile technique. A fresh sterile preparation is needed for each separate fluid collection to avoid cross contamination. Sepsis should be anticipated prior to a drainage procedure and supportive care started promptly. 

• 
Creation of persistent fistulous connection may occur with indwelling catheters, and is a complication that should be considered during procedural planning. 

• 
When attempting to drain an acute collection that has not yet been walled off with inflammatory granulation tissue, the guidewire or catheter may advance beyond the collection and perforate adjacent structures, not meeting adequate resistance at the far end of the collection. 

• 
Post-procedure, drainage catheters require daily maintenance to ensure proper function and resolution of the collection. The catheter, connections, and fixation devices should be checked daily and flushed up to three times a day with saline depending on the collection. The drain site should be kept clean and dry. 


Thoracentesis 
• 
One of the most common procedures in IR, thoracentesis typically involves ultrasound-guided removal of fluid through a valved 7-French catheter. 

• 
When deciding the intercostal approach, choose the level with the most fluid, ideally with fluid above and below the level of entry to allow for margin of error as the lung moves during respiration. 

• 
Pre-procedure ultrasound imaging can demonstrate high viscosity, septations, or clot for which a larger bore needle may be needed. The needle should enter the intercostal space just above the rib, to avoid the neurovascular bundle coursing along the inferior margin. 

• 
No more than 1 liter should be removed in 24 hours to avoid re-expansion pulmonary edema. 

• 
Upon removing the needle, gauze saturated with petroleum jelly should be applied to the entry wound. 



Paracentesis 
• 
Paracentesis for ascites is usually performed in the lower quadrants. Care should be taken to mark or observe the epigastric vessels under ultrasound. Visualization of the needle tip during entry is important to avoid viscus perforation. 

• 
Typically, up to 5 liters can be removed before it is necessary to replenish serum albumin. 




Enteric access 
Percutaneous gastrostomy indications 
• 
Esophageal, head and neck, and neurologic disease may necessitate percutaneous gastrostomy. Of note, there is strong evidence that gastrostomy does not improve survival or quality of life in elderly patients with dementia and decreased oral intake. 

• 
A less common indication for gastrostomy is for long-term bowel decompression, for instance due to palliation of malignant bowel obstruction or prolonged ileus. 


Percutaneous gastrostomy technique 
• 
Absolute contraindications to percutaneous gastrostomy include lack of appropriate window (such as colonic interposition), extensive gastric varices, and uncorrectable coagulopathy. 

• 
A nasogastric tube is inserted under fluoroscopic guidance, through which the stomach is insufflated with air. 

• 
Under fluoroscopic guidance, three T-fastener gastropexy clips are deployed to pexy the anterior wall of the stomach to the anterior abdominal wall. After each deployed T-fastener, intra-gastric position is confirmed with a small amount of contrast injected into the stomach. 

• 
After the pexy clips are in place and the stomach is firmly fastened against the anterior abdominal wall, the definitive gastrostomy puncture is made and serially dilated. The gastrostomy can be used in 24 hours after the patient is evaluated for peritoneal signs. 

• 
The gastrostomy tube must remain in place for at least a month to form a mature transperitoneal tract.
