Needles 
Needle sizing 
• 
Needle sizes measured as gauge — bigger number means smaller needle. 

• 
Smaller needles (e.g., 22 and 21 gauge) can be used for initial access into target structures, fine needle aspirations, small abscesses, and small vessels for vascular access. 

• 
Larger needles (e.g., 18 gauge) can be used for large abscesses, larger vessels that are easily accessible, and core needle biopsies. 




Wires 
Wire sizing 
• 
Wires are measured by diameter and sized in inches, with a standard wire measuring 0.035” in diameter and a microwire measuring 0.018” in diameter. 

• 
An 0.018” wire fits through a 22 gauge needle (or bigger), and a 0.035” wire fits through an 18 gauge needle (or bigger). 


Standard floppy tip wires 
• 
Standard wires have a floppy tip or J-tip which allows the wire to be safely inserted blindly (although once in the vessel the course should be followed on fluoroscopy). 

• 
A Bentson wire has 20 cm flexible tip length that is available as a standard or stiff shaft. 

• 
Rosen (Cook Medical) wire has a stiff shaft with short flexible tip and tight (1.5 mm) J-curve. 


Hydrophilic wires 
• 
Hydrophilic wires are used to cross a stenosis or for initial cannulation of an indwelling device, as would be performed for a routine check and change. 

• 
Roadrunner (Cook) and Glidewire (Terumo) wires are hydrophilic. 


Stiff wires 
• 
Stiff wires are used when structural rigidity is required. For instance, a device that dilates the subcutaneous tissues (such as a sheath, biliary drain, nephrostomy tube, etc.) needs to be inserted over a stiff wire. 

• 
Amplatz (Boston Scientific) and Lunderquist (Cook Medical) wires are stiff wires.

Catheter sizing 
• Catheters are measured by outer circumference and sized in French (Fr), where 1 Fr = 0.33 mm. For instance, a 6 Fr catheter has an external diameter of 2 mm. The luminal diameter will be slightly smaller. 
High-flow catheters 
• 
High-flow (also known as flush) catheters have multiple sideholes and may be coiled (most commonly; known as a pigtail or OmniFlush [Angiodynamics] catheter), curved, or straight. 

• 
High-flow catheters are used for large vessel angiography, such as the aorta and vena cava, and selection of the contralateral iliac artery. 


Selective and superselective catheters 
• 
Selective and superselective catheters have a single hole at the end of the catheter. There are numerous shapes of the distal portion, each tailored towards a specific situation or general purpose use. 

• 
C2 and SOS are reverse curved-tip catheters, best for basic visceral selection. 

• 
Mickelson is for more difficult selections, particularly bronchial, intercostal and lumbar arteries, and must be reformed in a large artery or branch vessel. 

• 
Simmons catheters have excellent stability for difficult selections, and must be reformed. 

• 
Berenstein, Kumpe and MPA catheters are angled-tip catheters.

Sheaths 
• 
Measured by inner circumference French size. 

• 
Sheaths are used for stabilizing access during a procedure. 

• 
A “peel-away” sheath is commonly used for maintaining access when placing catheters. 

• 
Sheath versus catheter: A sheath has a defined luminal diameter; however, the overall diameter of the sheath will be slightly larger. For instance, a 6 Fr sheath can by definition fit a 6 Fr catheter inside, but will be 7 or 8 Fr in external diameter. 


Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) 
• 
Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is the first-line technique for treatment of a stenosis, where a balloon is inflated across the stenosis to create a controlled stretch injury and increase the luminal cross-sectional area. 

• 
When treating a stenosis caused by atherosclerotic plaque, angioplasty widens the luminal diameter due to disruption of the intima and extension of the plaque into the media. 

• 
Most balloons are non-compliant. That is, they have a fixed diameter that does not further expand with increased applied pressure, though it will burst above a maximum rated pressure. They expand to open a blockage or stricture (seen as a “waist” in the balloon) or dilate the vasculature. 

• 
Cutting balloons are non-compliant balloons with microsurgical blades to break through a tight stricture. 

• 
In general, a balloon should be selected that is 10–20% larger than the vessel diameter. 

• 
Compliant balloons are inflated by volume, rather than pressure. They are used to fully conform to the vascular contour or occlude the vessel, commonly used for fully expanding/ molding a stent-graft against a vessel wall. 

• 
Balloons are sized by diameter in millimeters and length in centimeters. For instance, a 10 x 6 balloon is 10 mm in diameter and 6 cm in length. 

• 
Risks of angioplasty include distal emboli, vessel rupture, and dissection. Anticoagulation (typically heparin) should usually be used with angioplasty. 




Stents 
Self-expandable versus balloon-expandable 
• 
The two broad categories of stents are balloon-expandable and self-expandable stents. 

• 
In general, balloon-expandable stents have a higher radial force upon deployment but will stay deformed if crushed. Thus, balloon-expandable stents are suboptimal for sites prone to external compression, such as around joints or the adductor canal in the leg. 

• 
Self-expandable stents are more flexible and trackable through vessels than balloon- expandable stents. Their use is favored when the route to the lesion is tortuous or when the anatomy is prone to external compression. 



Covered or uncovered 
• 
Most stents are bare metal stents and provide only a scaffolding-like support that allows blood to still flow through the interstices; however, covered stents (e.g., stent grafts) are impervious to fluid and create a new conduit, commonly employed for treatment of aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms, ruptures, dissections, and TIPS. 

• 
Because stents are prone to in-stent stenosis, drug-eluting stents were developed to deliver antiproliferative agents into the arterial wall. 

• 
In general, a stent should be selected that is 1–2 cm longer than the stenosis, with a diameter that is 1–2 mm wider than the non-stenosed vessel lumen. A rule of thumb is 10% oversizing of an arterial stent and 20% oversizing of a venous stent. 


Embolic materials 
• 
The two main categories of embolic materials are permanent (coils, plugs, particles, glue, and sclerosing agent) and temporary (absorbable gelatin sponge and autologous clot). 

• 
Coils create thrombosis by inducing vascular stasis. The main advantage of coils is the ability for precise and quick placement, without distal embolization. The primary disadvantage is sacrifice of distal access: Once a vessel is coiled, it cannot be re-accessed for retreatment. 


When using coils for embolization of a specific lesion, the general technique is to first coil distal to the lesion, then proximal to it. This prevents recurrent bleeding from retrograde collaterals. 
• 
Plugs are cylinder-shaped baskets that act similarly to coils but are used for larger vessels with high flow rates. These are commonly used in splenic trauma or plug-assisted gastric variceal embolization (PARTO). 

• 
Particles are microscopic (diameter measured in microns) entities that flow distally to occlude small capillaries. Particles can be made of trisacyl gelatin or polyvinyl alcohol. Common uses include for tumors and various organs. Careful consideration must be used to avoid nontarget embolization. 

• 
Liquid embolic agents (e.g., glue) can be injected to quickly embolize a structure. Cyanoacrylate and ethylene vinyl alcohol are examples of glue that rapidly polymerizes when it comes in contact with blood. 

• 
Sclerosant agents damage the endothelial cells of the vessel wall, causing the vessel to shrink and dissolve over a period of weeks. Sodium tetradecyl sulfate, polidocanol, and ethanol are examples of sclerosants and can be used to treat lymphovascular malformations, varices or smaller varicose veins. 

• 
Absorbable gelatin sponge/slurry is the most commonly used temporary embolic agent, lasting 2–6 weeks. Common use is for emergent traumatic bleeding. Of important note, post-procedural CT imaging can show numerous gas locules in the embolized organ, and can mimic an abscess. 



Complications of embolization 
• 
Post-embolization syndrome usually occurs within the first day after embolization and clinically presents with pain, cramping, fever, and nausea/vomiting, thought to be due to release of endovascular inflammatory modulators by infarcted tissue. Treatment is NSAIDS, opioids when appropriate, and IV fluids. 

• 
Non-target embolization is unintentional embolization of structures other than the target. For instance, during uterine fibroid embolization there is a risk of non-target embolization of the ovaries. During bronchial artery embolization, there is a risk of non-target embolization to the brain causing stroke and to the spinal arteries causing paralysis.
