General Considerations for Angiography 
Vascular access 
Femoral arterial access technique 

needle should enter skin here 
(inferomedial femoral head) needle should be angled 45 degrees cranially for retrograde access (to the aorta) 
needle should be angled 45 degrees caudally for anterograde access (to the leg) 
• 
The common femoral artery (CFA) is the most common site for arterial access. Prior to obtaining access, distal pulse and capillary refill should be checked, and confirmed again after the procedure. 

• 
The CFA begins inferior to the inguinal ligament. From lateral to medial, the mnemonic NAVL helps to localize the femoral nerve, artery, vein, and lymphatics. 

• 
The ideal position to access the femoral artery is the inferomedial margin of the femoral head, for two reasons. First, the femoral head provides a hard surface to press 


nerve artery lymphatics 
against to provide adequate hemostasis. Second, at the level of the femoral head, the femoral artery and nerve are side by side. Additionally, if arterial puncture is performed too low, the femoral vein may be traversed with possible formation of arteriovenous fistula. 
Transradial artery access 
• 
While access via the radial artery has been largely adopted for coronary interventions, this is only starting to gain traction for the general IR practice, often limited by operator experience and training. 

• 
Advantages include earlier post-procedure ambulation, more effective hemostasis and patient comfort. 

• 
Disadvantages include higher rates of vasospasm (mitigated with an antispasmodic cocktail of heparin, nitroglycerin, and verapamil) and radial artery occlusion (can occur between 2–10% of cases). 

• 
Barbeau’s test is an alternative to the Allen’s test for evaluating collateral circulation of the hand. It involves placing a pulse oximeter on the ipsilateral thumb and then evaluating the morphology of the plethysmography tracing before, immediately after and two minutes after manual occlusion of the radial artery. Patients with type D tracing morphology have absent and non-recruitable flow, and should not undergo transradial catheterization. 

• 
The reverse Barbeau test is used for ulnar artery access. The pulse oximeter should be placed on the fifth finger when testing occlusion of the ulnar artery.  




Complications of vascular access 
Hematoma 
• 
A hematoma may be superficial or retroperitoneal. A superficial subcutaneous hematoma has a generally benign clinical course, while a retroperitoneal hematoma carries a risk of fatal hemorrhage. 

• 
There is increased risk of retroperitoneal hematoma with a high (more cranial) arterial puncture above the pelvic brim. 



Pseudoaneurysm 
• 
Pseudoaneurysm formation occurs in approximately 1% of arterial punctures. On color Doppler, a pseudoaneurysm appears as a swirling yin-yang with high-velocity flow at the site of communication with the femoral artery. 

• 
Watchful waiting can be performed for a small pseudoaneurysm <1 cm in size. Ultrasound-guided thrombin injection is the treatment of choice for a pseudoaneurysm >1 cm. Less commonly, ultrasound-guided compression of the neck of the pseudoaneurysm can be performed to thrombose the pseudoaneurysm. 


Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) 
• 
An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is an anomalous connection between an artery and a vein. AVFs are usually asymptomatic but may enlarge and ultimately cause high-output cardiac failure. 

• 
There is increased risk of developing an iatrogenic AVF with a low (inferior/distal) femoral arterial puncture. The femoral vein often passes deep to (instead of medial to) the femoral artery distal to the standard puncture site. 

• 
On Doppler ultrasound, an AVF demonstrates arterial flow within a vein and there is loss of the normal triphasic waveform in the artery. Increased diastolic flow is often seen in the artery proximal to the fistula. 





Injection rates 
• 
The terminology for injection rates for angiographic runs is “cc/sec for total cc.” For instance, “25 for 50” means an injection rate of 25 cc/sec for a total of 50 cc. 

• 
The diameter in mm of a vessel is a rough guide to the injection rate (in cc/sec), and the total volume of contrast injected depends on the intravascular volume of the vascular bed. 

• 
Air embolism is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of vascular procedures. 

• 
The most dangerous portion of a venous access procedure is the insertion of the catheter into the peel-away sheath. 

• 
If air embolism is suspected (e.g., if the patient becomes acutely hypoxic as the catheter is inserted into the peel-away sheath), the patient should be immediately placed in the left-lateral decubitus (left side down) position so the air bubble remains antidependent in the right heart. 100% oxygen should be administered. If practical, fluoroscopy can be used to identify the air bubble. Catheter aspiration can be considered if the air bubble is large.

Approach to interpreting an angiogram 

Early arterial phase Late arterial phase 

Parenchymal phase Venous phase (renal vein drains into IVC) 
Normal selective digital subtraction angiogram of the right renal artery demonstrates 4 phases of vascular opacification. 
• The mnemonic “what, where, when, VIA (vessels, interventions, anything else)” can be helpful to remember the comprehensive approach to evaluating a vascular case. 
What? 
• What type of study is it – angiogram, digital subtraction angiogram (DSA), venogram? 

Where? 
• 
Where in the body is the catheter and in which vessel? 

• 
Is a flush catheter in a large vessel or is it a selective/superselective angiogram? 



When? 
• 
Early arterial phase, late arterial phase, parenchymal phase, or venous phase? 

• 
Is there opacification of any veins during an arterial phase? If so, that suggests a shunt. 


Vessels? 
• 
Is there any contrast going where it shouldn’t, such as active extravasation or neovascularity? 

• 
Do the vessels have a normal contour? Is there any dissection, irregularity, stenosis, or encasement (external compression)? 




Interventions? 
• Any previously placed stents, grafts, filters, coils, surgical clips, or drains? 
Anything else? 
• Any other finding on the film? Bony fracture to suggest trauma? 


Abdominal and pelvic vascular anatomy 
Osseous landmarks 
• 
Celiac artery: Arises from the aorta at the level of T12 vertebral body. 

• 
Superior mesenteric artery (SMA): Arises at the level of the T12–L1 disc space. 

• 
Renal arteries: Arise at the level of the L1–L2 disc space. 

• 
Inferior mesenteric artery (IMA): Arises left of midline at the level of L3 vertebral body. 


Celiac axis anatomy 
• Approximately 75% of the time the celiac artery demonstrates normal arterial anatomy with 
three main branches: The left gastric, the common hepatic, and the splenic artery. The left gastric artery may be the source of bleeding in esophageal Mallory-Weiss tear.

Hepatic arterial anatomy and variants 
• 
Most commonly (75%), the proper hepatic artery supplies blood to the liver. The proper hepatic artery is the continuation of the common hepatic artery after the takeoff of the gastroduodenal artery. The proper hepatic artery divides into the right and left hepatic arteries. The cystic artery arises from the right hepatic artery to supply the gallbladder. 

• 
The left gastroepiploic artery arises from the splenic artery and anastomoses with the right gastroepiploic artery along the greater curvature of the stomach. The right gastroepiploic artery arises from the gastroduodenal artery. 

• 
A replaced right hepatic artery (RRHA) is present in 10–18% of patients, where the right hepatic artery arises from the SMA. A RRHA may become clinically significant in the setting of SMA disease or during abdominal surgery. 


left 

It is essential for the surgeon to be aware of a RRHA prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy to prevent 
inadvertent arterial injury. RRHA is beneficial in case of a living right hepatic donor, as the RRHA is longer and larger than a regular RHA. This allows a better anastomosis to the recipient vasculature. In contrast, there may be increased arterial complications if the hepatic transplant recipient has a RRHA, due to reduced diameter of the common hepatic artery. 
In the setting of a RRHA, SMA stenosis may theoretically predispose the right lobe of the liver to ischemia, although this is usually not clinically relevant due to intrahepatic collaterals and portal vein supply. 
• 
An accessory right hepatic artery is an artery arising from the SMA that supplies the right hepatic lobe in the presence of a normal right hepatic artery (arising from the proper hepatic artery). 

• 
An accessory left hepatic artery is an artery arising from the left gastric artery that supplies the left hepatic lobe in the presence of a normal left hepatic artery (arising from the proper hepatic artery). 

• 
A replaced left hepatic artery (RLHA) is present in 11–12% of patients, where the left hepatic artery arises from the left gastric artery. 



The presence of a RLHA is clinically significant during gastrectomy, as resection of the RLHA may predispose to liver injury. 
Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) 
• 
The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) arises from the anterior aorta at about the level of T12–L1 to supply the distal duodenum, the entire small bowel, and the proximal large bowel from the cecum to the mid-transverse colon. 

• 
The inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery is the first branch of the SMA. The inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery forms collaterals with the celiac artery. 

• 
The middle colic artery arises from the SMA and supplies the transverse colon. The middle colic artery anastomoses with the inferior mesenteric artery via the marginal artery of Drummond and the arc of Riolan. 

• 
The right colic artery courses retroperitoneal, supplying the right colon and hepatic flexure. 

• 
The terminal artery of the SMA is the ileocolic artery, which sends arterial branches to the terminal ileum, cecum, and appendix.

Inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) 
• 
The inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) originates at the left anterior aspect of the aorta at approximately the level of L3. 

• 
The IMA gives off the left colic artery to supply the descending colon. 

• 
The sigmoid arteries are variable in number. They run in the sigmoid mesocolon to supply the sigmoid. 

• 
The IMA terminates as the superior rectal (hemorrhoidal) artery, which supplies the upper rectum.

External iliac branches 
• 
The inferior epigastric artery anastomoses with the superior epigastric artery. 

• 
The deep circum.ex iliac artery anastomoses with the internal iliac via the iliolumbar artery. 

• 
The femoral artery is its terminal branch after passing posterior to the inguinal ligament and continues distally to supply the leg.

division 
• The anterior division of the internal iliac artery supplies most of the pelvic viscera. 
The major branches of the anterior division include the inferior gluteal artery, obturator artery and internal pudendal artery. 
The prostatic or uterine/vaginal artery, superior/inferior vesicle artery and middle/inferior rectal arteries can have variable origins and are best identified on selective angiography based on their area of supply. The pathway of Winslow is an important anastomotic connection from the subclavian, internal mammary, superior epigastric, and inferior epigastric arteries into the external iliac artery. 
The internal iliac artery arcades create important collateral pathways between the superior and middle rectal arteries. 
A corona mortis “crown of death” is a normal variant in which the obturator artery arises from the external iliac artery, and is an important consideration in procedural planning or pelvic trauma. 
• The posterior division of the internal iliac artery supplies the pelvic and gluteal musculature. 
The branches of the posterior division include the lateral sacral artery, the iliolumbar artery (anastomoses with external iliac via the deep circumflex iliac artery), and the superior gluteal artery.
