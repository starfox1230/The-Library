Lymphatic interventions 
Anatomy of the lymphatic system 

• 
The lymphatic system is made up of a large network of lymphatic vessels, organs and tissues. 

• 
The thoracic duct carries 1–2 liters of lymphatic fluid a day, most of which comes from the intestinal and hepatic lymphatic ducts. Flow varies in relation to fatty content of a meal. 

• 
Elevation of hepatic sinusoidal pressure such as cirrhosis and right-sided heart failure increases thoracic duct flow substantially.

Thoracic duct embolization (TDE) 

Thoracic duct embolization: A) Lymphatic access is obtained as seen on left abdominopelvic lymphangiogram. 
B) Select puncture of the cisterna chyli was performed with a 15 cm 21-gauge trocar needle (arrow), access maintained with V18 wire and inner cannula advanced over the wire. C) Lymphangiogram of the chest shows contrast pooling at T8-9 (arrow), likely the site of thoracic duct leak (yellow arrow). D) Embolization using n-BCA glue in 1:1 ethiodol to glue mixture (vol 2mL) was performed of the thoracic duct leak.

• 
Chylous leaks can be caused by rupture of the thoracic duct and its tributaries from thoracic surgery such as esophagectomy, abdominal surgery, or nontraumatic causes such as malignancy (lymphoma) or idiopathic. 

• 
Initial treatment is diet modification with a non-fat diet for 2–3 days prior to attempting TDE. 

• 
It is important to consent patients for pancreatitis as well as non-targeted embolization. 

• 
5 mL of lipiodol is injected in each leg followed by a 20 mL saline push. Once the lymphographic dye reaches the abdomen, the cisterna chyli is visualized at the level of L1–3. 

• 
After direct puncture with a long spinal needle, a wire is extended to the thorax. The thoracic duct is coiled along its entirety to provide a matrix for glue polymerization with a 

1:1 mixture of glue and lipiodol. 


• 
It is important to carefully watch the glue as it is injected to identify nontargeted embolization. If the IVC is transgressed, glue can embolize to the pulmonary arteries resulting in acute pulmonary embolus. 

• 
Rare complications include transgression of visceral organs with the puncture needle, resulting in peritonitis or bleeding. 

• 
Embolization of the pulmonary artery which may or may not be symptomatic. 

• 
Rare long-term complications that should be consented for include chronic lower extremity edema, chronic
