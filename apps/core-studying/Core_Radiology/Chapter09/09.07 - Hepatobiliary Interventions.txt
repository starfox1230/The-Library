Hepatobiliary interventions 
Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis 
• 
The classic angiographic finding of liver cirrhosis is corkscrew appearance of the hepatic artery branches. 

• 
A hypervascular mass in a cirrhotic liver may represent hepatocellular carcinoma. 

• 
Parenchymal liver biopsy can give useful prognostic information based on the grade of hepatic fibrosis in the setting of cirrhosis, hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Results may initiate treatment of chronic hepatitis, assess response to therapy, and help predict relapse in autoimmune hepatitis. 

• 
Typically, ultrasound-guided biopsy of the left or right lobe is performed in the most peripheral aspect to ensure that no major vessels, dilated bile ducts or gallbladder are in the path of the biopsy needle. 



Biliary disease 
Biliary intervention overview and technique 
• 
Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) is the injection of contrast into the biliary tree through a percutaneous approach, traversing the hepatic parenchyma. 

• 
The two most common indications for PTC are relief of biliary obstruction and to provide biliary diversion in the case of ductal injury, which may be post-traumatic or postsurgical. Less common indications include percutaneous treatment of biliary calculi (endoscopic treatment is much 


more common) and adjunctive pre-surgical treatment prior to a biliary anastomosis. A biliary anastomosis is technically facilitated by having a pre-placed catheter to sew around. 
• 
Pre-procedure prophylactic antibiotics are administered, as biliary stasis predisposes to bacterial overgrowth. Gram-negative coverage is needed, typically with levofloxacin. 

• 
The right and left biliary trees are accessed using slightly different techniques. 

• 
The right biliary tree is accessed via a right midaxillary line two-puncture approach. The needle should be inserted directly over the ribs, as the neurovascular bundle runs underneath each rib. 


A 22-gauge needle is inserted, parallel to the table and to the inferior border of the liver. Contrast is injected as the needle is withdrawn in an attempt to opacify the biliary tree. Once a bile duct is opacified, the needle is temporarily left in place and a second puncture is made with a 
21-gauge needle as low as possible to access the duct. 
Once the second needle has accessed a duct, a 0.018” wire is advanced, exchanged for a 5 or 6 Fr sheath, 
and subsequently a hydrophilic wire (such as a Roadrunner or Glidewire) is guided into the small bowel. 
The hydrophilic wire is exchanged for a stiff wire (e.g., Amplatz) and the biliary drain is placed. 
Extra sideholes may be manually cut, if necessary, to allow sideholes to extend from the biliary puncture 
site to the bowel. The role of regular flushing is controversial. Some institutions advocate regular forward flushing, while 
others do not routinely flush. Regardless, a biliary drain should never be aspirated, as aspiration could draw up bowel contents into the biliary system and risk the development of cholangitis. Three-month preventative maintenance is recommended. 
• The left biliary tree is accessed by a left subxiphoid approach, in a similar manner to the right side; however, ultrasound can often visualize dilated ducts, obviating the need for two punctures. 

Biliary intervention overview (continued) 
• 
If stent placement is required to treat a stricture, a metallic stent is usually only placed in patients with a life expectancy of less than six months. Most metallic stents cannot be removed and have a median patency of 6–8 months, although newer covered metal stents can be removed. 

• 
Plastic stents, which are placed endoscopically, do allow regular exchange. 

• 
An alternative to stent placement is an internal/external biliary drain, although this option is less comfortable for the patient due to the external drain. 

• 
Most contraindications to PTC are relative. For instance, although an intrahepatic tumor (primary or metastasis) should not be traversed, a directly accessible bile duct may still be present. Similarly, ascites is a contraindication but therapeutic paracentesis can be first performed. 

• 
Complications of percutaneous biliary drainage include sepsis, hemorrhage, bile leak, hemobilia (due to arterial-biliary fistula), and abscess.

Bile duct injury 
• 
The most common cause of bile duct injury is iatrogenic from a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A less common cause of bile duct injury is from orthotopic liver transplant. 

• 
Treatment is to provide biliary diversion to drainage bag to allow the leak to heal. 



Sclerosing cholangitis 
• 
Sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic inflammatory and fibrosing process leading to multifocal strictures of the intra- and extrahepatic biliary tree. Sclerosing cholangitis clinically presents with obstructive jaundice, malaise, and abdominal pain. It occurs more commonly in men and is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis). 

• 
Sclerosing cholangitis ultimately leads to biliary cirrhosis and increases the risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma. 

• 
Treatment of sclerosing cholangitis is liver transplant, although percutaneous biliary drainage can provide palliative relief for the symptoms of obstructive jaundice. 

• 
Cholangiogram shows multifocal biliary strictures throughout the intra- and extrahepatic biliary tree. The differential diagnosis of multifocal biliary strictures includes: 


Sclerosing cholangitis. Primary biliary cirrhosis. Multifocal cholangiocarcinoma. Chronic bacterial cholangitis. AIDS cholangitis (usually associated with papillary stenosis). 

Malignant biliary obstruction 
• 
Unilateral biliary obstruction of either the right or left hepatic ductal system may be due to metastatic disease or primary malignancy of the bile ducts. In the majority of cases, only the affected biliary system requires treatment. 

• 
Hilar obstruction, in contrast, is due most commonly to a hilar cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor), which most often requires two biliary drains, one each in the right and left ducts. Occasionally an anatomic anomaly, such as anomalous drainage of the right duct directly into the left duct, may allow complete drainage of a hilar obstruction with a single biliary drain. Pre-procedure MRCP may be helpful to delineate biliary anatomy.

• 
Percutaneous gallbladder drainage (cholecystostomy) is indicated for the treatment of acute calculous or acalculous cholecystitis in patients who are not surgical candidates. 

• 
Cholecystotomy is a temporizing measure for treatment of calculous cholecystitis prior to cholecystectomy, but it may cure acalculous cholecystitis without surgery. 

• 
Of note, cultures are negative in 40% of acute cholecystitis. 

• 
Similar to percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, prophylactic antibiotics are given. 

• 
The two percutaneous approaches to the gallbladder are transhepatic and transperitoneal. Transhepatic (through the liver): In the transhepatic approach, a needle is inserted in the midaxillary line (either intercostal or subcostal) and directed towards the bare area of the gallbladder fossa through the 


liver under sonographic guidance. Transhepatic cholecystostomy has decreased risk of peritoneal bile leak, but increases the risk of liver laceration. The transhepatic approach is more commonly performed. Transperitoneal (avoiding the liver): In the transperitoneal approach, the needle is directed into the 
gallbladder from a subcostal approach in the right anterior abdomen, beneath the liver margin. While there is less risk of damaging the liver, a transperitoneal approach carries an increased risk of peritoneal bile leak. Additionally, a transperitoneal approach necessitates penetration of the gallbladder fundus, which is the most mobile portion. 
• The drainage tube must remain in place until the following criteria are met: Patient is clinically improved. There is a risk of sepsis if the tube is removed prematurely. Cystic duct and common bile duct are demonstrated to be patent on repeat cholangiogram. At least 6 weeks have passed since placement (regardless of transhepatic or transperitoneal approach), 
to allow a fibrous tract to develop extending from the gallbladder to the skin puncture. Transperitoneal cholecystostomy has greater risk of incomplete tract formation and bile peritonitis following tube removal. 

Portal hypertension 
Measuring portal pressure 
• 
Direct portal vein (PV) pressure measurement requires traversing the hepatic parenchyma and is thus invasive and impractical. Wedged hepatic vein pressure is routinely measured via an internal jugular vein catheter and is thought to equal PV pressure in most patients. 

• 
The corrected sinusoidal gradient is an estimate of the portosystemic gradient and represents the actual sinusoidal resistance to portal flow. It is calculated as: 


(Wedged hepatic vein pressure) – (free hepatic vein pressure) 
• Portal hypertension is defined as a portosystemic gradient >5 mm Hg. 
Collateral pathways seen in portal hypertension 

Light blue represents portal veins • dark blue represents systemic veins 
• 
Esophageal varices: Coronary vein • azygos/hemiazygos veins 

• 
Gastric fundal varices: Splenic vein • azygos veins 

• 
Splenorenal shunt: Splenic or short gastric • left adrenal/inferior phrenic • left renal vein 

• 
Mesenteric varices: SMV or IMV • iliac veins 

• 
Caput medusa: Umbilical vein • epigastric veins 

• 
Hemorrhoids: IMV • inferior hemorrhoidal veins 



Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) 
• 
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) lowers elevated portal pressures by the creation of a direct connection between the portal vein and the hepatic vein. 

• 
The most common indication for TIPS is treatment of variceal hemorrhage that cannot be controlled endoscopically and refractory ascites. Other indications for TIPS include Budd-Chiari (hepatic vein thrombosis), and hepatic hydrothorax. 

• 
Assessment of hepatic dysfunction is performed pre-procedure with either the Child-Pugh classification or Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. 


The Child-Pugh classification of hepatic dysfunction combines lab values (INR, bilirubin, and albumin) with clinical assessment (ascites and hepatic encephalopathy). The MELD score of hepatic dysfunction combines INR, bilirubin, and creatinine in a complex logarithmic 
formula. The higher the MELD score, the higher the post-TIPS mortality. 
• Absolute contraindications to TIPS include: Right-sided heart failure, which will be worsened by TIPS, as right-sided venous return increases. Severe active hepatic failure, as the post-TIPS shunting of blood beyond the hepatic sinusoids can cause 
liver function to worsen further. Severe hepatic encephalopathy, which TIPS can worsen. 
• 
Portal vein patency should be established pre-procedure with cross-sectional or ultrasound imaging. 

• 
Usually the right hepatic vein is connected with the right portal vein via a covered stent. The right hepatic vein has relatively constant anatomy and tends to be larger than the left. 

• 
After the right hepatic vein is cannulated, wedged balloon CO2 occlusion venography is performed and the portal vein is retrogradely opacified. CO2 is the preferred contrast agent as it is 400 times less viscous than iodinated contrast and is therefore easily able to pass through the hepatic sinusoids. 

• 
The most demanding portion of the procedure is establishing access into a portal vein. Once a tract between the hepatic and portal circulation is secured, the tract is sequentially dilated and stented, aiming for a reduction of the portosystemic gradient to <12 mm Hg. 

• 
TIPS patency is followed by Doppler ultrasound, discussed in the gastrointestinal imaging chapter.
