Gastroesophageal varices and portosystemic shunts 
Ballon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) 
• Ballon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO) is used for the management of gastric variceal bleeding due to portal hypertension and is more commonly performed in Asia. In the United States and Europe, BRTO is usually performed when endoscopic therapy fails and TIPS is not an option. 
In the United States and Europe, TIPS is the first-line treatment for gastric variceal hemorrhage. By decompressing portal hypertension, TIPS induces hemostasis of gastric varices and reduces the risk of rebleeding, but may cause liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy as described previously. 
• BRTO involves endovascular obliteration of gastric varices by injection of a sclerosing agent directly into the varix via a gastrorenal or gastrocaval shunt while the variceal blood outflow is occluded by an inflated balloon. 
In patients without spontaneous gastrorenal or gastrocaval shunt, BRTO is not a treatment option. 
• 
By obstructing a major gastrorenal shunt, BRTO increases portal venous pressure, therefore improving liver function, lowering the risk of liver failure and hepatic encaphalopathy. However, it can worsen ascites and esophageal varices if present. 

• 
BRTO has comparable efficacy to TIPS in treating refractory gastric variceal hemorrhage. In fact, it is associated with lower rates of rebleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, and mortality. 

• 
Overview of the procedure: Percutaneous access is achieved through the femoral vein (most common) or jugular vein. Then, catheterization of the gastrorenal shunt via the left renal vein is performed. Balloon occlusion of the gastrorenal shunt outflow is done followed by a shunt venogram to map the 


anatomy. Sclerosant is injected upstream into the varices. Occlusive balloon is left in place for 4–24 hours until sclerosant has reached stasis. 
• 
Variations to BRTO have been developed with shorter procedural time and occlusion of the shunt by either coiling or vascular plugging. 

• 
Common complications include gross hematuria, aggravation of esophageal varices, ascites, hydrothorax/pleural effusion, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and portal vein thrombosis. 




Oncologic interventions 
Ablation therapy 
• 
Percutaneous tumor ablation is a safe alternative to surgical resection in carefully selected patients. The role of ablation is actively evolving and expanding. Ablation is commonly performed in the liver, kidney, lung, and bone, and its role in other sites (e.g., prostate, thyroid) is also expanding. Common indications include local control of solitary or oligometastatic disease (1–5 metastatic lesions) and/or pain palliation. The best outcomes for local control are obtained for lesions that are <5 cm in maximal diameter, but indications for debulking and palliation of larger lesions are increasing. The most common techniques for percutaneous ablation include cryoablation, microwave ablation, and radiofrequency ablation. Other techniques include irreversible electroporation, laser, and ethanol ablation. 

• 
Heat sink phenomenon is a limitation of all thermal ablation techniques, where adjacent blood vessels prevent large temperature variations, resulting in cooler temperatures of the surrounding tissue and the potential for residual unablated tissue.

B) Intraprocedure axial CT shows three ablation probes in place. The ablation zone is not well seen during the procedure. C) Follow-up post-contrast axial CT at three years shows expected appearance of the ablation zone (arrow) with peripheral calcification. 
• 
Mechanism: The RF electrode generates a simple electrical circuit through the body with alternating electromagnetic fields that agitate adjacent molecules, resulting in frictional heating of tissue around the probe, and ultimately results in coagulation necrosis and cell death at temperatures greater than 55°C. There is an exponential drop in temperature as you get further from the probe. Grounding pads are used to serve as a dispersive electrode. 

• 
Technique: A single heating cycle slowly heats the tissue to 50–100°C for 6–15 minutes. Care must be taken to not increase the temperature too quickly, which can char the soft tissues and cause evaporation with formation of microbubbles, both of which increase the electrical impedance and limit flow of current, reducing the effectiveness of the probe. 

• 
Advantages: RFA is the most established and widely available option. The total procedure time is shorter when compared to cryoablation. RFA cauterizes small vessels and decreases bleeding risk. RFA is the most cost-effective option compared to other ablation techniques. 

• 
Disadvantages: RFA is heavily dependent on good electrical and thermal tissue conductivity. The ablation zone is not well monitored in real time. RFA is most susceptible to the heat sink effect, which can result in residual unablated tissue and an unpredictable ablation zone. 


Microwave ablation (MWA) 
• 
Mechanism: An electromagnetic field is used to force polar molecules (mostly H2O) to continuously realign with an oscillating electric field, which increases the kinetic energy of the molecules and results in heating. The microwave energy is transmitted through the antenna and directly into the volume of tissue around the antenna. Rapid cell death occurs at temperatures greater than 55°C, and surrounding tissue can reach over 100°C. The antennas are then cooled with water or gas. 

• 
Technique: One MWA probe is placed with imaging guidance and the ablation is typically completed with one heating cycle. The power and duration of the heat is dependent on tumor size, but usually varies between 45W and 80W for 5–10 minutes. 

• 
Advantages: MWA can generate very high temperatures, ablate through charred or necrotic tissue, and rapidly heats a large volume of tissue. It is less susceptible to heat sink effects from adjacent vessels and can cauterize blood vessels, decreasing bleeding risk. MWA has potential for simultaneous use of multiple antennas and does not require grounding pads, unlike RFA. 

• 
Disadvantages: MWA uses larger diameter probes. There is a higher risk when ablating central tumors and any region with critical structures due to the inability to monitor the ablation zone in real time and relative unpredictability of the size and shape of the ablation zone. Similarly, due to the inability to precisely control the ablation zone, MWA is less precise with smaller tumors.

Cryoablation (CA) 
• 
Mechanism: Rapid expansion of gas within the cryoablation (CA) probe cools the probe to –190°C, resulting in an “iceball” of the surrounding tissue. At least two cycles of rapid freezing and slow thawing are done, each lasting 5–20 minutes. Cell death occurs secondary to immediate cellular toxicity or delayed apoptosis and ischemia. 

• 
Technique:  Probes are usually placed under CT or MRI guidance and should be spaced 1–2 cm apart. The iceball should extend at least 0.5 cm beyond the tumor to decrease likelihood of recurrence. 

• 
Advantages: The iceball is well visualized in real time on CT, MRI, and ultrasound. There is comparatively less risk with cryoablation of central tumors. Multiple probes can be used simultaneously in cryoablation rather than sequentially. Cryoablation has a lower complication rate with typically less post-procedural pain. 

• 
Disadvantages: Cryoablation has a slightly increased bleeding risk due to the lack of concurrent cautery. Multiple probes and several freeze-thaw cycles result in longer procedural time. Cryoablation creates a robust inflammatory response that may result in “cryoshock,” typically seen with large volume liver cryoablation, which is mediated by cytokine production and consists of hypotension, multi-organ failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Cryoablation may be associated with higher cost.

Hepatocellular carcinoma and Liver metastases 
• 
Normal liver parenchyma receives majority of its blood supply from the portal vein, whereas hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is preferentially supplied by the hepatic artery. Catheter-directed transarterial therapies for palliative treatment of HCC, such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or transarterial radioembolization (TARE) described below, take advantage of this mismatch in blood supply by deliverying treatment directly into feeding arteries of the tumor while minimizing adverse effect to normal liver parenchyma. 

• 
TACE and TARE are also used as bridging therapy to liver transplant for patients with HCC, and for locoregional treatment of other primary hepatic malignancies (e.g. cholangiocarcinoma) and hepatic metastases. 


Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) 
• 
Conventional TACE (cTACE) consists of intra-arterial infusion of chemotherapy followed by embolization of the tumor’s arterial blood supply with particles or gelfoam. 

• 
TACE with drug eluting beads (DEB-TACE) uses microspheres that embolize and deliver chemotherapy. 

• 
Both types of TACE promote tumor cell death by 1) delivering high dose of cytotoxic chemotherapy to the tumor than can be administered via a systemic route, and 2) inducing local hypoxia and ischemia. 

• 
Common contraindications of TACE include: Portal vein thrombosis (associated with post-treatment liver failure). High tumor burden (>50%). Extrahepatic metastases. Decompensated cirrhosis (encephalopathy, tension ascites, Child-Pugh C). Elevated bilirubin (>3 mg/dL). 

• 
Pre-procedural cross-sectional imaging is usually performed for treatment planning, with the goals of: evaluate for variant anatomy, extrahepatic collateral blood supply (i.e., right phrenic artery), and possible contraindications. 

• 
Procedural steps: After obtaining arterial access, celiac arteriogram is done to map out anatomy. Selective or super-selective embolization can be done with the use of a catheter or micro-catheter into the 


proximal arterial branches of a small tumor. 

Alternatively, medications or embolic agents can be delivered from a proximal point (left or right hepatic artery), called lobar embolization, if there are multiple lesions. Materials are injected until stasis/low flow is seen under fluoroscopy. Arteriography is performed to document persistent low flow or absence of flow to the region. 
• Immediate post-procedural CT imaging is usually avoided because normal post-procedural changes may mimic an abscess.

Follow-up angiography demonstrated pruning of distal arterial branches and no residual tumor enhancement in the embolized territory.

• 
Post-embolization syndrome is very common after TACE. Symptoms include right upper quadrant pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. LFT may show transaminitis. 

• 
Other common complications include: abscess, acute liver failure, or biliary injuries (the biliary tree is primarily supplied by hepatic arteries). 

• 
TARE, also called selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT), consists of intra-arterial infusion of microspheres with radioactive isotopes (i.e., Yttrium-90). 

• 
TARE does not have the same macro-embolic effects as TACE. Treatment effect depends on radiation emitted by the spheres which induce tumor necrosis. Intra-arterial administration allows for targeted delivery of high radiation dose to the tumor than can be given via external beam radiation. 

• 
Due to less disruption of vessels, TARE can be performed in the setting of portal vein thrombosis. 

• 
Absolute contraindications include: pregnancy, breastfeeding, uncorrectable GI vascular reflux, and uncorrectable hepatopulmonary shunting. 

• 
TARE procedure is similar to TACE except for a few differences as below: 




After angiography to map out the anatomy, labeled macroaggregates of albumin (MAA) are injected, followed by a nuclear medicine study to confirm tracer uptake. The distribution of MAA is similar to that of the radioembolization microspheres, which allows mapping, 
calculation of dose, and evaluation for potential extrahepatic shunt or nontarget embolization (i.e., uptake 
in lungs, GI, skin). TARE should NEVER be performed when there is a shunt to the GI tract, because even small amounts can cause enteritis or ulceration. 
To prevent nontarget embolization, coil embolization of nearby arteries can be performed. TARE does NOT cause significant post-embolization syndrome. 
Portal vein embolization 
• 
Portal vein embolization is typically performed prior to partial hepatectomy. 

• 
Blood supply is redirected to the future liver remnant (FLR) which causes hypertrophy. 

• 
Most commonly, target for embolization is the right lobe. Right hepatic lobe is usually large enough to maintain function after left hepatectomy. 

• 
The portal vein is accessed percutaneously. 

• 
Contraindications: Patients with portal hypertension or extensive ipsilateral tumor thrombus should not undergo portal vein embolization due to risk of altered hemodynamics and massive tumoral necrosis. 




Renal neoplasms and angiomyolipoma 
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) 
• 
Most renal cell carcinomas (RCC) are hypervascular. The tumors often feature arteriovenous shunting and venous lakes, with a classic angiographic appearance of bizarre neovascularity. 

• 
Radiofrequency ablation has been a successful minimally invasive treatment for RCC in patients who are not good operative candidates. 


Oncocytoma 
• 
Oncocytoma is a benign renal mass that cannot be reliably distinguished from renal cell carcinoma on cross-sectional imaging. 

• 
Angiography classically shows a spokewheel appearance with a peritumoral halo. In contrast to RCC, bizarre neoplastic vessels are absent. 



Axial T1-weighted MRI shows a mass in the lower pole Coronal T1-weighted post-contrast fat-saturated MRI 
of the right kidney which is isointense to fat (arrow). shows saturation of the upper component of the mass (yellow arrow), consistent with macroscopic fat. An inferior enhancing component is present (red arrow). 



Angiomyolipoma: Case courtesy Bela Kis, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Renal angiomyolipoma is a hypervascular hamartoma containing blood vessels (angio), smooth muscle (myo), and fat (lipoma). An AML is diagnosed on cross-sectional imaging as a renal mass containing macroscopic fat. 

• 
Angiography shows tortuous feeding arteries, which have a sunburst appearance on the parenchymal phase. Occasionally, small aneurysms are visible, which predispose to risk of hemorrhage, especially if the AML is >4 cm in diameter. In contrast to a renal arteriovenous fistula, AMLs do not feature arteriovenous shunting – that is, no veins will be opacified during arterial phase imaging. 

• 
It is not always possible to differentiate an AML from RCC on angiography, so cross-sectional imaging is usually indicated if a suspected AML is diagnosed incidentally.
