Upper urinary tract obstruction 
Percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) indications 
• 
The most common indication for percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) is urinary diversion of an obstructed kidney due to stone, malignancy, or stricture. Pyonephrosis (pus in the collecting system) is an emergent indication for percutaneous nephrostomy. 

• 
Less commonly, PCN may be used to place an anterograde ureteral stent if a retrograde ureteral stent is unable to be placed cystoscopically. 


Percutaneous nephrostomy technique 
• 
Direct visualization of the collecting system is necessary. In most cases, urinary obstruction will lead to hydronephrosis, allowing ultrasound-directed puncture. If there is no dilation of the collecting system, intravenous contrast can be administered to opacify the nondilated collecting system and allow fluoroscopic guidance. 

• 
The patient is positioned prone and a 22-gauge needle is used for direct posterior access. Bleeding complications can be minimized by entering the kidney in the relatively avascular zone of Brödel, which is defined as the plane between the ventral and dorsal renal artery branches. The optimal entry plane is therefore in the posterolateral kidney directed towards a posterior calyx. 

• 
Complications most commonly include bleeding and infection. Although transient hematuria occurs in nearly every patient, serious bleeding complications are rare. Of particular concern in cases of pre-existing infection is the risk of sepsis caused by extensive manipulation.

Uterine fibroids and menorrhagia 
Uterine artery embolization (UAE) 
• 
The two primary indications of uterine artery embolization (UAE) are symptomatic treatment of fibroids and postpartum hemorrhage. 

• 
In the United States, particles (e.g., tris-acryl gelatin microspheres, polyvinyl alcohol particles) are most commonly used in UAE for fibroids, while gelatin foam is usually used for postpartum hemorrhage. 

• 
The goal of fibroid treatment is to produce hemorrhagic infarction of the hypervascular fibroids while still maintaining adequate perfusion to the endometrium and myometrium, thus preserving future fertility. 

• 
There is approximately a 1.25% serious complication rate for UAE, which is especially important to consider as many of these patients are otherwise healthy reproductive-age women. Serious complications include abscess, endometritis, and ovarian insufficiency due to non-target embolization, leading to transient amenorrhea or premature menopause.

Prostate disease 
Prostate artery embolization (PAE) 
• 
Prostate artery embolization (PAE) is a safe and effective treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia. PAE is recommended for patients with moderate to severe symptoms of urinary obstruction. 

• 
PAE causes ischemic necrosis of the prostate gland which in turn results in gland volume reduction, thereby improving symptoms. 

• 
Preprocedural cross-sectional imaging is usually done to assess internal iliac artery anatomy. The prostate artery origin is highly variable. Common origin of prostate artery includes: Superior vesical artery, internal pudendal artery, obturator 


artery, or from the internal iliac artery directly. 

• Procedural steps: 
Patients are treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications during the procedure and recovery. Access can be performed from common femoral or radial artery approach. From the femoral approach, the contralateral internal iliac artery is catheterized and catheter is positioned 
in the proximal internal iliac artery. 

Then, an angiogram is performed and the prostate artery is selected with a microcatheter. Prostate artery angiogram is performed to evaluate for prostate opacification and for collateral vessels. To avoid potential non-target embolization, superselective catheterization or coil embolization of 
anastomoses may be performed. Embolization is performed until near stasis. Angiogram is repeated to document slow or absence of flow. Ipsilateral internal iliac artery is selected and procedure is repeated. 
• 
Common minor complications include hematuria, hematospermia, and dysuria. 

• 
Recent randomized control trial comparing PAE to TURP showed that International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) did not differ significantly between patient groups at 12 weeks, with significantly lower adverse events and blood loss after PAE. 



Adrenal vein sampling 
• 
Adrenal vein sampling can be performed to determine laterality or diagnose adrenal hyperplasia in the setting of hyperaldosteronism. 

• 
The procedure can be performed either with simultaneous left and right sampling or sequentially sampling the right and left. 

• 
A Renal Double Curve (RDC) catheter is helpful for selecting the adrenal vein.
