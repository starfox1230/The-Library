Arterial Interventions 
Trauma 
General considerations 
• 
Trauma accounts for the majority of IR emergencies. Level 1 trauma centers must have IR procedures available 24 hours a day. 

• 
Management of traumatic solid organ injury depends on the degree of injury and hemodynamics of the patient. Conservative management involves resuscitation, monitoring of vitals and laboratory values and serial exams, and is best for stable patients with low-grade solid organ injury. IR angiography and embolization are best for stable patients with moderate-to-high grade organ injuries and CT findings showing contrast extravasation or pseudoaneurysm. IR embolization can be applied to either contained or uncontained hemorrhage, with the intention of avoiding surgery. Management of high-grade injuries can vary based on the organ involved. 


Aortic injury 
• 
CTA is the gold standard for evaluation of suspected traumatic aortic injury. 

• 
Open surgical repair is the gold standard treatment for acute traumatic aortic injury with endovascular stent-graft repair becoming more commonly performed recently.

Renal trauma 
• 
Renal trauma can be classified as blunt (>80% of injuries), penetrating (such as gunshot or stab wound), or iatrogenic. Hematuria is usually present with renal trauma, regardless of etiology. A horseshoe kidney is especially susceptible to traumatic injury as it is not protected by the inferior ribs and may be compressed against the vertebral column. 

• 
The Organ Injury Scale (OIS) from the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) classification is the most widely used classification of renal injury. This scale is further discussed in the “Genitourinary imaging” chapter. 


Grades I–III include nonexpanding hematomas or parenchymal laceration without collecting system injury. 
These injuries are usually managed conservatively. Grade IV includes a deep parenchymal laceration which extends to the collecting system, causing the CT finding of extravasation of opacified urine on delayed imaging. Injury to the renal vessels with contained hemorrhage is also OIS grade IV, often treated with endovascular coil embolization as in the case below. 
Grade V (most severe) injury is a shattered kidney with avulsion of the renal hilum. Treatment is surgical. 

Renal trauma (continued) 
• 
Other important vascular injuries not included in the OIS classification include traumatic renal artery thrombosis and renal artery pseudoaneurysm. 

• 
Indications for endovascular treatment of renal trauma include active extravasation, dissection, or pseudoaneurysm. Treatment is usually superselective coil embolization. 



OIS Grade IV renal injury: Selective DSA angiogram of the left kidney (left image) shows lack of vascularization of the lower pole of the kidney and two foci of active contrast extravasation (red arrows). These were treated super selectively with coiling. Post-embolization unenhanced CT (right image) shows residual irregular pooling of contrast in the renal cortex (red arrow) and a large perinephric urinoma (yellow arrows) diagnostic of grade IV injury. There are bullet fragments in the left hemiabdomen.

Renal arteriovenous fistulas 
• 
Renal arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are almost always acquired, secondary to trauma or renal biopsy. 

• 
The majority of renal AVFs are asymptomatic and often heal spontaneously. When symptomatic, hematuria is the most common complaint. Less commonly, a renal AVF can lead to high-output cardiac failure or spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage. 

• 
Angiography of an AVF shows venous opacification during the arterial phase. 

• 
Treatment is with embolization (coils, glue, or alcohol). 


Pelvic vascular trauma 

Initial trauma-board pelvic radiograph shows diastasis Contrast-enhanced CT shows a large hematoma in of the pubic symphysis (arrows). the right hemipelvis (red arrows) with foci of active extravasation (yellow arrows). 


Case courtesy Alisa Suzuki Han, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Pelvic trauma can lead to catastrophic hemorrhage from arterial injury. It is possible to exsanguinate completely within the pelvis: A 3 cm diastasis of the symphysis pubis doubles the potential intra-pelvic volume to approximately 8 liters. 

• 
In the setting of active pelvic bleeding and pelvic fractures, angiography is usually performed prior to orthopedic surgery. Active bleeding can be difficult to control surgically. 

• 
The first step in treating a pelvic arterial injury is to perform a nonselective pelvic arteriogram, followed by selective bilateral internal iliac arteriograms of the anterior and posterior divisions. 

• 
Because of the rich collateral supply in the pelvis, rapid nonselective gelfoam embolization of either the entire anterior or posterior division of the internal iliac artery is often acceptable. A potentially time-consuming superselective embolization should be avoided in the setting of life-threatening hemorrhage. 





Massive hemoptysis 
• 
Massive hemoptysis is defined as gross hemorrhage (typically 300–600 mL of blood in a 24-hour period) and can be a life-threatening emergency as a result of asphyxia rather than hemorrhagic shock. Thus, hemodynamics is not a suitable measure for severity. 

• 
Most cases originate from the bronchial arteries as opposed to the lower-pressure pulmonary-artery system. 

• 
Risk factors include smoking, cystic fibrosis or vasculitis. 

• 
The patient should be positioned with the affected lung down to improve oxygenation and reduce fluid accumulation in the other lung. 

• 
Pre-procedure bronchoscopy or CTA are useful to localize the site of bleeding. 


Bronchial artery embolization for hemoptysis 



Massive hemoptysis caused by thoracic malignancy treated with particle embolization of the common bronchial artery trunk (post-embolization images not shown). In this case, the right bronchial arteries were not able to be accessed. Due to the emergent nature of the hemoptysis, the common bronchial trunk was embolized to complete stasis with particles. There was complete resolution of the active extravasation. The mass was later shown to be a thymoma. 
Case courtesy Alisa Suzuki Han, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Massive hemoptysis has a very high mortality, most commonly due to asphyxiation. The vast majority (90%) of cases of hemoptysis involve the bronchial arteries, with the pulmonary arteries involved in most of the rest of cases. Occasionally, other systemic arteries may be involved, so if a patient continues to bleed after evaluation of the bronchial and pulmonary arterial circulation, the subclavian, internal mammary, inferior phrenic, and celiac arteries should be evaluated as well. 

• 
Chronic inflammation can lead to hypertrophied bronchial arteries and subsequent hemoptysis. In the United States, cystic fibrosis and thoracic malignancy are the most common causes of hemoptysis. Worldwide, tuberculosis and fungal infection are more common. 


Bronchial artery embolization (continued) 
• 
The bronchial arteries arise from the thoracic aorta at T5–T6, although the arterial anatomy is quite variable. There are usually one or two bronchial arteries on each side. 

• 
Embolization is performed with a distal embolic agent, most commonly particles. Initial angiography should carefully evaluate for the rare presence of a left to right shunt prior to particle embolization to prevent inadvertent cerebral embolization. Embolization is usually performed to near-stasis. 


Because rebleeding after treatment is common, coils are rarely used to treat hemoptysis. Because coils prevent repeat access, the use of coils would preclude retreatment. 
• A potentially devastating complication is nontarget embolization of the spinal cord via the anterior spinal artery or smaller tributaries arising from bronchial and intercostal arteries. A complete neurological exam should be documented prior to the procedure. 
Pulmonary massive hemoptysis 
• 
Before performing a pulmonary angiogram, it is essential to evaluate an EKG to ensure that a left bundle branch block (LBBB) is not present. If the pulmonary artery catheter were to cause temporary right bundle branch block in the presence of a LBBB, the lack of left-sided conduction may cause complete heart block, which can be fatal. A temporary pacer should be placed prior to pulmonary arteriography in the presence of a LBBB. 

• 
Normal right-sided pressures: Right atrium: 0–8 mmHg. Right ventricle: 0–8 mmHg diastolic; 15–30 mmHg systolic. Pulmonary artery: 3–12 mmHg diastolic; 15–30 mmHg systolic. 


Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (AVM) 


Case courtesy Alisa Suzuki Han, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
A pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is an abnormal connection between the pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins, causing a right to left shunt. 

• 
Patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, may have multiple pulmonary AVMs. HHT can clinically present with brain abscess, stroke, or recurrent epistaxis (due to nasal mucosa telangiectasia). 


IR: 608 
Pulmonary AVM (continued) 
• 
Coils must be used to embolize a pulmonary AVM. Particles are contraindicated as the right to left shunt would cause brain emboli and infarction. 

• 
Most pulmonary AVMs have a single feeding artery and coiling of this inflow artery (via a pulmonary arterial approach) is usually sufficient treatment. 


Note that the treatment of peripheral (e.g., in a limb) AVM generally requires elimination of the entire nidus, which is often fed from multiple arterial branches. 
• An asymptomatic lesion with a feeding artery size >3 mm or a symptomatic lesion (i.e., prior infarct or brain abscess) are indications for treatment. 



Obstetric emergencies 
Hemorrhage 
• 
Antepartum hemorrhage can be caused by placenta previa, placental abruption, and uterine rupture. These are usually treated with urgent Caesarean section or hysterectomy. Role of IR includes placing balloon catheters prior to going to the operating room, minimize blood loss, control of hemorrhage, use cell saver capability. 

• 
Postpartum hemorrhage can be caused by uterine inversion, uterine atony, and genital tract trauma. IR serves both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes by interrogating the internal iliac arteries for the source of hemorrhage, often the uterine artery.  


Pseudoaneurysm 
• 
Uterine artery pseudoaneurysms (UAPs) typically present several weeks after delivery. They are usually diagnosed by ultrasound or CT prior to transcatheter arterial embolization. 

• 
Intervention includes bilateral internal iliac or uterine artery ligation. When other treatments fail, hysterectomy is the last resort. 




Postpartum uterine artery pseudoaneurysm:

(C) and late (D) images. Coil embolization (blue arrow) of the UA was performed, without residual contrast extravasation (E). Case courtesy Arjun Sharma, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 


Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeding 
Upper GI bleeding 
• 
Endoscopy is the best initial procedure for acute upper GI bleeding, defined as above the ligament of Treitz. Endoscopy can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. 

• 
If the patient failed endoscopic attempts at hemostasis or is too unstable for evaluation by endoscopy, IR embolization can be considered as long as a clear bleed is seen on pre­procedure CTA or on endoscopy. 

• 
In some cases, empiric embolization of a gastric artery or the gastroduodenal artery may be considered if the angiogram is negative due to the copious collaterals between the celiac axis and the SMA. However, lower GI collaterals are much less well developed and there is a significant risk of bowel infarct with indiscriminate lower GI embolization. 


Lower GI bleeding 
• For lower GI bleeding, a hemodynamically stable patient should first be evaluated by mesenteric CT angiogram or nuclear medicine tagged red blood cell scan to localize the bleed, as these tests are thought to be more sensitive than angiography. A bleeding rate of 0.5–1.0 mL/min is generally required to be angiographically positive. 
A tagged red blood cell scan can detect bleeding rate as low as 0.2–0.4 mL/min. Many institutions now favor mesenteric CT angiography as the first test for evaluation of acute lower GI bleeding because CT is rapid, easy to perform, and readily available. On CTA, acute bleeding is seen as contrast extravasation. CTA may be able to detect bleeding rates as low as 0.35 mL/min. 
• 
A hemodynamically unstable patient with clinical evidence of current GI bleeding may go straight to angiography. 

• 
Intra-arterial infusion of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) can often control active lower GI bleeding, but there is a very high rebleeding rate once the infusion is stopped. Vasopressin is most useful in cases of bleeding from antimesenteric vessels, which are more difficult to reach directly by catheter. Major complications of vasopressin are seen in up to 20% including arrhythmia, pulmonary edema, and hypertension. 


Vasopressin is directly infused into the SMA or IMA. The dose of vasopressin is 0.2–0.4 units per minute (100 units mixed in 500 mL saline given at 1 mL/minute), given as a continuous infusion for up to 24 hours. Vasopressin can only be used for 24 hours before tachyphylaxis (lack of further response) develops. 
Diverticular bleed 


Diverticular bleed: Initial selective DSA angiogram of the SMA (top left image) shows an area of active extravasation (arrow) in a distal right branch of the middle colic artery. 
Superselective DSA angiogram of the middle colic artery (top right image) shows that the area of active extravasation is too distal to be reached by catheter. At this point, the surgery team was consulted and it was determined that the patient was not a good operative candidate. The decision was made to embolize as selectively as possible, knowing the possible risk of bowel ischemia. 
After placement of several coils in the middle colic branches, follow-up selective SMA angiogram (left image) demonstrates resolution of the active extravasation. There was no post-procedural evidence of bowel ischemia. 
Case courtesy Alisa Suzuki Han, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Diverticulosis is the most common cause of lower GI bleeding in older adults. 

• 
Most patients respond to conservative management, but angiography can be used for stable or unstable patients who fail medical management. 

• 
If active extravasation is seen, potential therapies include superselective embolization (most commonly with coils) or vasopressin infusion. 


Angiodysplasia 
• 
Angiodysplasia is a small age-related vascular malformation and common cause of unexplained GI bleeding and anemia. It is most common in the cecum and ascending colon but can be found anywhere in the GI tract. 

• 
Heyde’s syndrome is a classic association of aortic valve stenosis and bleeding from angiodysplasia. 



Hemorrhoidal bleed 
• 
Endovascular coil occlusion of the distal branches of the superior rectal artery has the advantages of leaving the hemorrhoidal tissue in place, preserves anal continence, and does not involve the creation of rectal wounds (no local care required). 

• 
Coil or particle embolization may be used. Particles may involve more distal branches and decrease the risk of recurrence. 



Hemorrhoid embolization: A) Selective IMA runoff shows the superior rectal artery branches. B) Superselective DSA of the superior rectal artery shows contrast blush corresponding to hemorrhoids (arow). C) Coil embolization  (arrows) was performed with subsequent angiography (D) showing successful embolization of the hemorrhoids.

Mesenteric ischemia 
• Mesenteric ischemia is inadequate blood supply to the bowel. It is seen most commonly in the elderly and has multiple causes, including acute arterial embolism, chronic arterial stenosis, venous occlusion, and low-flow states. For the purposes of interventions, the etiologies can be divided into acute or chronic. 
IR: 612 
Acute mesenteric ischemia 
• 
Acute mesenteric ischemia typically presents as catastrophic abdominal pain, often with lactic acidosis. Acute mesenteric ischemia is most commonly caused by an SMA embolus. 

• 
An SMA embolism distal to the middle colic artery carries the highest high risk of intestinal ischemia, as there are few native distal collaterals. The middle colic artery anastomoses with the IMA via the marginal artery of Drummond and the arc of Riolan. 

• 
In most patients with acute mesenteric ischemia, treatment is surgical revascularization (embolectomy or bypass), direct inspection of bowel, and resection of necrotic bowel. 

• 
In select patients with acute embolic mesenteric ischemia (patients without peritoneal signs or clinical findings suggestive of bowel necrosis), endovascular therapy with thrombolysis or suction embolectomy may be performed. 

• 
Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) is a highly lethal (70–100% mortality) form of acute mesenteric ischemia. NOMI is also known as “intestinal necrosis with a patent arterial tree” and features spasm and narrowing of multiple branches of the mesenteric arteries. Direct arterial infusion of the vasodilator papaverine (60 mg bolus, then 30–60 mg/hr) is the primary treatment of NOMI. 



Acute mesenteric ischemia: 79-year-old female presented with altered mental status, found to have bowel wall thickening and multifocal thrombus of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) on CT. Diagnostic angiogram shows extensive atherosclerotic calcifications and near total occlusion of the proximal SMA (left image, arrow). A catheter was positioned across the thrombus and left in place for overnight infusion of tPA. The next day, angiography of the superior mesenteric artery demonstrates substantially decreased clot burden with improved flow to the jejunal branch vessels (right image, arrow). 

Chronic mesenteric ischemia 
• 
Chronic mesenteric ischemia is usually caused by atherosclerosis. The classic clinical presentation is postprandial abdominal pain out of proportion to the physical exam. 

• 
Mesenteric angiography shows ostial narrowing of the mesenteric vessels, often with post­stenotic dilation. The lateral aortogram is the most useful view to evaluate the origins of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. 

• 
Because mesenteric collaterals are so extensive, at least two of three mesenteric arteries (celiac, SMA, and IMA) must be diseased to produce symptoms in chronic disease. 

• 
Chronic mesenteric ischemia can be treated with endovascular angioplasty and stenting. 




Aneurysmal disease 
• 
Aneurysms are considered when an artery is 1.5 times the size of the normal vessel.  

• 
A true aneurysm involves all three layers of the arterial wall: Intima, media and adventitia. 

• 
A pseudoaneurysm contains only one to two layers of the vessel wall and  occurs in the setting of trauma, malignancy or infection. 

• 
Aneurysms can vary with respect to size and growth, and management decisions should be based on the risk of rupture. 


Aortic aneurysmal disease 
• 
Minimally invasive endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is a widely accepted alternative to surgical repair, with decreased perioperative morbidity and mortality. 

• 
A comprehensive review of aortic aneurysmal disease and the 5 types of endoleaks is listed in the “Vascular” chapter. Interventional radiology is best suited for treating the following types of endoleaks: 

• 
Type I endoleaks result from failure of the stent graft to form an adequate seal at the proximal (type IA) or distal (type IB) attachment sites. Prompt intervention is indicated and management consists of balloon angioplasty at the attachment sites 


to attempt to approximate the stent graft with the vessel wall, deploying another expandable bare metal stent over the attachment sites, or embolization. 
• Type II endoleaks are the most common type and result from retrograde filling of the excluded aneurysm sac by branch vessels, typically the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and lumbar arteries. 
Many have slow flow and tend to spontaneously thrombose, resulting in no change or even decrease in 
size of the aneurysm sac. While there is risk for retrograde flow to increase sac size, the majority of aneurysms will decrease or stay the same, thus management is controversial and is considered when there is persistent endoleak or the sac enlarges by greater than 5 mm. 
Management consists of accessing the sac either by transarterial approach or direct sac puncture, and subsequent embolization of the feeding vessel. 
• Type III endoleaks are uncommon and result from loss of device integrity. 
Prompt management is indicated and consists of deploying a new stent graft over the defect, with subsequent angioplasty to obtain a good seal. 
Visceral artery aneurysm 
• Visceral artery aneurysm can occur anywhere, with splenic and hepatic artery aneurysms amongst the most common types. 
Splenic artery aneurysm 
• 
Splenic artery aneurysm is the most common visceral aneurysm. Multiparous females and patients with portal hypertension are at increased risk of developing splenic artery aneurysms. Splenic artery aneurysms have an increased risk of rupture during pregnancy. 

• 
A splenic artery pseudoaneurysm may be the result of trauma or pancreatitis. 

• 
Indications for treatment of a splenic artery aneurysm include presence of symptoms (such as left upper quadrant pain), aneurysm size >2.5 cm, and prior to expected pregnancy. 

• 
Endovascular coil embolization is the preferred approach. In general coils are first placed distal to the aneurysm neck (to exclude retrograde collateral flow), then placed proximally. 

• 
Proximal splenic embolization is less painful and better at preserving splenic function because collateral blood supply can be preserved. Embolization should be performed in the mid splenic artery between the dorsal pancreatic and pancreatica magna arteries to reduce potential pancreatic complications such as ischemic pancreatitis. Distal embolization causes more tissue necrosis and can be more painful. 



Splenic artery aneurysm: Selective DSA angiogram of the splenic artery (left image) shows an outpouching of contrast (arrow) in the proximal artery. Proximal coil embolization (right image) demonstrates resolution of the active extravasation. 

Hepatic artery aneurysm 
• 
Hepatic artery aneurysm is the second most common visceral aneurysm. 

• 
Indications for treatment of a visceral artery aneurysm include presence of symptoms (such as pain), aneurysm size >2.5 cm, and prior to expected pregnancy. 

• 
Embolization of the right hepatic artery distal to the cystic artery (which arises from the right hepatic artery) is preferred, as embolization proximal to the cystic artery increases the risk of ischemic cholecystitis, which may be seen in up to 10% of cases. 




Renal artery stenosis 
• 
Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of renal artery stenosis in older adults and tends to affect the ostia (origin) of the renal arteries. 

• 
RAS resulting from atherosclerotic disease typically involves the ostium and proximal third of the main renal artery. 

• 
The success of atherosclerotic RAS angioplasty is debatable. However, angioplasty ± stenting may be advocated in the setting of hemodynamically significant RAS, resistant hypertension, deteriorating renal function, bilateral atherosclerotic RAS, unexplained CHF, and recurrent episodes of flash pulmonary edema. 



Upper e.tremity vascular anatomy 
• 
The upper extremity vascular tree begins at the aortic arch branching into the brachiocephalic artery on the right, or directly into the subclavian artery on the left. The subclavian artery gives rise to five main branches: vertebral artery, internal thoracic artery (internal mammary artery), thyrocervical trunk, costocervical trunk, and dorsal scapular artery. 

• 
Once the subclavian artery crosses the lateral margin of the first rib, it continues as the axillary artery divided into 3 parts and 6 major branches that supply the muscles of the shoulder girdle, humerus, scapula, and chest wall (see “Vascular” chapter for details). 

• 
Once the axillary artery crosses the inferior lateral margin of the teres major muscle, it continues as the brachial artery coursing along the medial aspect of the upper arm. It gives rise to the deep brachial artery and anteriorly in the antecubital fossa, divides into the radial and ulnar arteries. 

• 
Arising immediately beyond the origins of the radial and ulnar arteries, the radial recurrent artery and the posterior and anterior ulnar recurrent arteries form anastomoses with branches of the brachial and deep brachial arteries. The common interosseous artery divides into anterior and posterior branches. 

• 
In the lateral forearm, the radial artery courses to the wrist, traverses the snuffbox, and turns medially to give rise to the deep palmar arch. In the medial forearm, the ulnar artery arises from the common interosseous artery and continues into the superficial palmar arch, giving off the common palmar digital arteries.

Hypothenar hammer: Digital subtraction angiogram of the hand shows an approximately 2–3 cm occlusion of the ulnar artery (between the blue arrowheads), and multifocal occlusions of the proper palmar digital arteries in the second through fourth digits (red arrowheads). 

DSA angiogram of the wrist better shows the segmental occlusion of the ulnar artery (between the blue arrowheads). At surgery, an ulnar artery aneurysm (not visible on angiography) was found and treated. 
Case courtesy Alisa Suzuki Han, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital 
• 
Hypothenar hammer syndrome represents injury to the ulnar artery as it crosses the hamate bone. Chronic repetitive trauma causes the ulnar artery to chronically be traumatized at the hamate, leading to intimal injury, thrombus, aneurysm, or pseudoaneurysm. 

• 
The classic clinical history of hypothenar hammer syndrome is a jackhammer operator with ischemia of the fourth and fifth digits. 

• 
Imaging shows occlusion of the ulnar artery, often with distal embolic occlusions due to distal thrombi, usually in the fourth and fifth fingers (but third finger also seen in the case above). 

• 
Treatment is surgical, as there is often ulnar artery injury not apparent on angiography. 



Buerger disease 
• 
As previously discussed in the “Vascular” chapter, Buerger disease is a small- and medium- vessel vasculitis that typically occurs in male smokers. It more commonly involves the legs but may also involve the hands, presenting with ischemia, ulcerations, and even gangrene. 

• 
Small vessel occlusions and prominent corkscrew collaterals are typical features. 


Raynaud disease 
• 
Raynaud disease is small arterial vasospasm triggered by cold temperature. 

• 
On imaging, there is decreased perfusion of the distal digital arteries, with improvement upon warming or vasodilator administration. 

• 
Raynaud disease is associated with scleroderma and other connective tissue disorders. 




Lo.er e.tremity vascular anatomy 

Lower extremity three vessel runoff angiogram. A) Yellow arrow – CFA, blue arrow – profunda femoris, green arrow – SFA; B) green arrow – SFA, blue arrow – descending geniculate artery; C) green arrow – tibioperoneal trunk, blue arrow – ATA, yellow arrow – PTA, red arrow – peroneal artery. Note the small calf AVM supplied by a small posterior tibial branch and a distal branch of the superior medial geniculate artery. D) Blue arrow – dorsalis pedis, yellow arrow – PTA, green arrow – deep plantar arch. 
• 
The lower extremity vascular tree begins when the external iliac artery continues into the common femoral artery (CFA) at the level of the inguinal ligament. The CFA branches into the profunda femoris posteriorly and the superficial femoral artery (SFA). The profunda femoris artery supplies the medial and posterior thigh as well as the proximal femur with the medial and lateral femoral circumflex artery branches. 

• 
The SFA continues in the adductor canal of the anterior compartment of the thigh, dives into the adductor hiatus and enters the posterior compartment of the thigh as the popliteal artery. After the popliteal artery courses past the inferior border of the popliteus muscle, it branches into the anterior tibial artery (ATA) and the tibioperoneal trunk. 

• 
The ATA passes through the interosseous membrane and courses within the anterior compartment of the leg. It continues to the dorsum of the foot as the dorsalis pedis artery. 

• 
The tibioperoneal trunk divides into the peroneal artery, which supplies the lateral compartment of the leg, and posterior tibial artery which courses along the deep posterior leg muscles, enters the tarsal tunnel with the tibial nerve, and divides into the medial and lateral plantar arteries. 



Peripheral vascular disease 
Femoropopliteal disease 
• Similar to aortoiliac disease, the second TransAtlantic Inter-Society (TASC-II) consensus 
classifies femoropopliteal lesions and gives associated recommendations for intervention. Type A: Single stenosis =10 cm: Endovascular treatment is the treatment of choice. Type B: Multiple lesions (stenosis or occlusion), each <5 cm; single lesion <15 cm: Endovascular treatment 
is preferred, depending on patient comorbidities and preference. 
Type C: Multiple stenoses or occlusions >15 cm: Surgery is preferred, depending on patient comorbidities and preference. Type D: Chronic total occlusion: Surgery is treatment of choice. 


Acute thromboembolic disease 
• Acute limb ischemia is an emergency and is often associated with pain, pallor, poikilothermia (coldness), pulselessness, and paresthesias. Blue toe syndrome is acute thromboembolism in the toes. The characteristic imaging feature in the upper extremities is occlusion of distal small arteries of the hand. 
Thromboembolic disease of the upper extremities is most commonly caused by cardiac emboli (of which atrial fibrillation is a common cause). Less commonly, a subclavian artery aneurysm may be the source of the thrombus. 
If the source of emboli is central (such as the heart), bilateral disease would be expected, while a unilateral lesion would show unilateral emboli. 
• 
Angiography shows an acute cutoff of the affected vessel, often with a meniscus sign. Significant atherosclerotic disease may be absent. 

• 
Treatment options include surgical embolectomy, surgical bypass graft, and endovascular thrombolysis. When attempting to treat endovascularly, a hydrophilic wire is used to cross the lesion. A multi-sidehole infusion catheter is placed across the thrombus and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is infused at 0.5 mg/hr for 48–72 hours. 

• 
While receiving intra-arterial tPA, the patient must be cared for in the ICU, with regular monitoring of hematocrit and fibrinogen. TPA infusion should be slowed if the fibrinogen decreases to <150 mg/dL and stopped if it reaches <100 mg/dL.
