Cerebrovascular 
Radiotracers 
Tc-99m DTPA / Tc-99m pertechnetate 
• 
Technetium-99m has a half-life of 6 hours and is used in the majority of nuclear imaging. 

• 
Tc-99m DTPA and pertechnetate are transient perfusion agents. There is no uptake within the brain parenchyma as they do not cross intact blood-brain barrier. Activity is seen in the scalp, calvarium, subarachnoid spaces, major cerebral arteries and venous sinuses. 

• 
Transient perfusion agents are reserved for planar imaging only and are now uncommonly used. 



Tc-99m HMPAO / Tc-99m ECD 
• 
Both HMPAO and ECD are lipophilic perfusion agents that cross the blood-brain barrier. To be retained in the cell, ECD is enzymatically modified. In contrast, HMPAO simply needs to be protonated to be trapped. Thus, ECD is only taken up by living cells while HMPAO uptake is a marker of perfusion. In the evaluation of subacute infarct, the phenomenon of luxury perfusion can cause HMPAO uptake to increase (due to increased perfusion), while ECD will show the true defect representing the infarct core. 

• 
HMPAO and ECD show activity in the brain parenchyma, mainly gray matter. 

• 
Of these two agents, ECD is generally preferred for brain imaging, because it has more rapid blood pool clearance, better shelf life, more accurate characterization of perfusion, and is only taken up by living cells. 

• 
Both tracers are used for SPECT imaging. 


Iodine-123 ioflupane (I-123 FP-CIT or DaTscan) 
• Iodine-123 has a half-life of 13 hours. I-123 ioflupane is a cocaine analog that binds to the presynaptic dopamine transporter (DaT). It is used in SPECT imaging for the differentiation of essential tremor from parkinsonism. 

Thallium-201 
• Thallium-201 has a half-life of 73 hours and is used for SPECT imaging in the differentiation of tumor recurrence versus radiation necrosis. Thallium accumulates in viable tumor but not normal brain tissue. 

PET agents 
• 
F-18 FDG is the most common FDA-approved PET agent used for brain imaging. 

• 
F-18 florbetapir, F-18 florbetaben and F-18 flutemetamol are FDA-approved PET agents for imaging of beta-amyloid. 

• 
In 2020, F-18 flortaucipir was approved by FDA for tau imaging. 

• 
Other PET radiotracers are emerging that target specific neuroreceptors (such as F-18-DOPA targeting the dopamine transporter). 




Radionuclide imaging of the brain 
Evaluation of cerebral perfusion 
• 
Cerebral perfusion reserve can be assessed with an acetazolamide (Diamox) challenge. Normally, cerebral blood flow increases after administration of 1 g Diamox, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that causes increased cerebral CO2 concentration and thereby cerebrovascular vasodilation. 

• 
Areas of the brain that already have maximized their autoregulatory mechanisms will not show an increase in perfusion after Diamox administration, and therefore will have relatively reduced activity compared to the rest of the brain. These areas are at risk for infarction. 



Brain death 

Frontal and lateral planar images 
following injection of Tc-99m HMPAO show absent intracranial 
uptake (empty light bulb sign) and 
increased perfusion in the face (particularly nasal region) and scalp. Absent cerebral perfusion is consistent with brain death in the proper clinical setting. 
• 
In brain death, intravenously injected radiotracer is unable to enter the cranial cavity due to increased intracranial pressure. 

• 
SPECT imaging can be performed, either with HMPAO or ECD-labeled Tc-99m. 

• 
Imaging shows absence of tracer perfusing the brain. The hot-nose sign represents increased collateral flow seen in brain death, but is not specific. 


Dementia imaging 
• 
Perfusion imaging with SPECT and glucose metabolism with PET are helpful in the early diagnosis of dementia based on parallel patterns. 

• 
Alzheimer disease typically shows asymmetrically to symmetrically reduced perfusion (on SPECT) or hypometabolism (on FDG-PET) in the posterior cingulate gyrus and posterotemporal and parietal lobes, with sparing of the sensorimotor cortex, occipital lobes and deep nuclei. With further progression of disease, frontal lobes can also be involved. 



F-18 FDG PET and PET/CT overlay images of a patient with memory difficulties show hypometabolism predominantly in the parietal and temporal cortex (arrows), greater on the left. There is sparing of the sensorimotor cortex, occipital cortex, and deep nuclei (not shown). This pattern can be seen with Alzheimer disease in the appropriate clinical context.

• 
Lewy body dementia appears similar to Alzheimer but also involves the occipital lobes. 

• 
Multi-infarct dementia shows multiple asymmetric foci of decreased metabolism/perfusion. 

• 
Pick disease (frontotemporal dementia) is characterized by decreased uptake in the frontal lobes and anterior portion of the temporal lobes. 

• 
Huntington disease shows decreased uptake in the basal ganglia. 

• 
Parkinson disease is characterized by decreased dopamine transporter density in the striatum on SPECT and PET, demonstrated with use of agents such as I-123 ioflupane (DaTscan) or F-18-DOPA. 



Normal versus abnormal I-123 ioflupane uptake on SPECT and SPECT/CT overlay: The left two images show normal symmetric comma-shaped activity in the caudate nucleus and putamen. The right two images show asymmetric and reduced activity in both striata, greater on the left, resulting in loss of the comma shape. 
Seizure imaging 
• 
In general, blood perfusion and metabolism of seizure foci are increased during seizure (ictal imaging), and decreased between seizures (interictal imaging). 

• 
Ictal perfusion SPECT with Tc-99m HMPAO or ECD is the most sensitive, but technically challenging to perform because the radiotracer must be injected during the seizure or within 30 seconds after the end of the seizure. 

• 
Interictal PET with F-18 FDG is very sensitive in localizing partial complex seizures, which usually originate in the temporal lobe. Ictal PET is not possible due to slow FDG uptake. 

• 
Extratemporal seizure focus is more difficult to localize. Ictal SPECT is the most sensitive. 



Crossed cerebellar diaschisis 
• Crossed cerebellar diaschisis is a commonly encountered phenomenon in the presence of a supratentorial lesion (seen in tumors, stroke, and trauma), where the cerebellar hemisphere contralateral to the lesion shows decreased radiotracer uptake. This phenomenon is thought to be due to interruption of corticopontine-cerebellar pathways. 



Axial F-18 FDG PET (right image) shows near absent glucose metabolism in the left cerebral hemisphere due to known encephalomalacia. Relatively decreased FDG uptake in the right cerebellum (left image) is consistent with crossed cerebellar diaschisis. 
• 
Several nuclear imaging protocols have been described in the differentiation of tumor recurrence versus radiation necrosis. Regardless of the radiotracer involved, fusion to MRI is usually performed. 

• 
Thallium-201 generally accumulates in malignant gliomas and not in post-treatment granulation tissue (i.e., thallium is not taken up by radiation necrosis). Thallium-201 uptake requires a living cell and blood-brain barrier disruption. The degree of uptake can be graded in comparison to the scalp activity: 


Uptake <scalp is low; uptake between scalp and 2x scalp is moderate; and uptake >2x scalp is high. 



• Dual-phase F-18 FDG PET employs early and delayed imaging to evaluate a region of suspected tumor recurrence versus radiation necrosis. PET scanning is performed at 1 hour and 4 hours after the injection of the radiotracer. Dual phase PET has been shown to have increased accuracy for the assessment of recurrence versus post-treatment changes in metastatic disease compared to single-phase PET. 


Cerebrospinal fluid imaging 
Radiotracer: Indium-111 DTPA 
• 
Indium-111 has a half-life of 67 hours. 

• 
In-111 DTPA is ideal for cerebrospinal fluid imaging because it is non-lipid soluble, not metabolized, and has a long half-life (CSF imaging may span several days). It is administered intrathecally by lumbar puncture. 

• 
Normally, radiotracer should reach the basal cisterns by 1 hour, the sylvian and anterior interhemispheric cisterns by 2–6 hours, cerebral convexities by 12 hours, and the arachnoid villi in the sagittal sinus by 24 hours. 

• 
Presence of radiotracer activity in the lateral ventricles is abnormal. Failure of radiotracer ascent over the cerebral convexities at 24 hours is also abnormal. 

• 
Due to its short half-life (6 hours), Tc-99m DTPA is used for CSF studies that do not require prolonged imaging, including the evaluation of CSF leak and shunt patency. 



Normal cisternogram: 

Planar images at different projections were obtained at 4 hours following intrathecal injection of 0.54 mCi       In-111 DTPA. There is normal trident appearance of tracer activity in the 
sylvian and anterior interhemispheric 
cisterns. Activity is also present in the basilar cisterns and spinal canal. 

Normal pressure hydrocephalus 
• 
Radionuclide cisternography can be used to confirm suspected communicating hydrocephalus in patients with the classic clinical triad of normal pressure hydrocephalus (ataxia, incontinence, dementia), who would benefit from CSF shunting. 

• 
Communicating hydrocephalus is characterized by early entry of radioactivity into the lateral ventricles within 6 hours, persistent intraventricular activity, and lack of activity over the cerebral convexities after 24–48 hours.  



CSF leak 
• 
Common locations for CSF leak are the ear, paranasal sinuses, and nose. 

• 
CSF leak can be identified by asymmetric activity in the region of the ears on frontal imaging, or activity in the nose on lateral imaging. Subtle leaks can only be detected by placing cotton pledgets in the area of concern, removing after several hours and counting the pledgets' activity relative to plasma activity. 

• 
For spinal CSF leak, radioisotope cisternography shows diffusion of the tracer into the paraspinal extra-arachnoidal space. Correlation with MR or CT myelography may show triangular CSF space expansion at nerve root sleeves. A common pitfall is perineural cysts which are discrete round lesions. 



Evaluation of CSF shunt patency 
• 
Tc-99m DTPA or less commonly In-111 DTPA are injected into the shunt reservoir. 

• 
If the distal limb of the shunt is patent, radiotracer activity should rapidly pass through the shunt catheter and into the peritoneal cavity or right atrium. 

• 
Manual occlusion of the distal limb should normally show reflux of radiotracer into the ventricular system. This is not seen in the presence of proximal limb occlusion.
