Gastrointestinal 
Liver-spleen imaging 
Radiotracer: Tc-99m sulfur colloid 
• 
Sulfur colloid is taken up by reticuloendothelial cells, which are found in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Sulfur colloid is also taken up by Kupffer cells in the liver. Hepatic Kupffer cells make up only approximately 10% of the liver mass. 

• 
80–90% of sulfur colloid particles are taken up by the liver. Most of the remainder is taken up by the spleen, and a small amount taken up in the bone marrow. The bone marrow is not normally seen at typical windowing levels. 

• 
Although Tc-99m has a physical half-life of 6 hours, sulfur colloid is rapidly cleared with a biologic half-life of 2–3 minutes. 



Normal liver-spleen scan following administration of 4.2 mCi Tc-99m sulfur colloid shows homogeneous uptake in the liver and spleen. 
Note splenic uptake is slightly 
lower in intensity than the liver. Bone marrow uptake is faint. 

Focal decreased hepatic uptake on sulfur colloid scan 
• 
The most common cause of a photopenic defect (complete absence of radiotracer) is a hepatic cyst. It may be difficult to distinguish focal decreased uptake from a photopenic defect if the lesion is small. 

• 
Most hepatic masses cause focal decreased radiocolloid uptake, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), adenoma, and abscess. Focal decreased uptake should raise concern for HCC in a patient with any risk factors for HCC such as cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis. 



Focal increased hepatic uptake on sulfur colloid scan 
• 
Focal nodular hyperplasia, discussed below, may hyperconcentrate radiocolloid. 

• 
A regenerating nodule in a cirrhotic liver can cause focal increased radiocolloid uptake. 

• 
Budd-Chiari syndrome, or hepatic vein thrombosis, can lead to increased uptake in the caudate lobe in the later stage of disease. 



Colloid shift 
• Colloid shift is increased sulfur colloid accumulation within the spleen and bone marrow. It suggests liver dysfunction, most commonly due to cirrhosis. 

Diffuse pulmonary uptake 
• Diffuse pulmonary uptake on a sulfur colloid scan is nonspecific, and can be seen in: 
Cirrhosis. COPD with superimposed infection. Langerhans cell histiocytosis. High serum aluminum (either due to antacids or excess aluminum in the colloid preparation). 
• 
Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is a benign liver mass that can have a variable appearance on a sulfur colloid scan. Most commonly, FNH will be indistinguishable from background liver due to Kupffer cells within the FNH. FNH may also have increased uptake due to a combination of hypervascularity and Kupffer sulfur colloid uptake. In approximately 1/3 of cases there is insufficient colloid concentration and FNH may appear as a photopenic defect. 

• 
In contrast to FNH, a hepatic adenoma does not contain Kupffer cells and will be consistently photopenic. 

• 
An adjunct or alternative to sulfur colloid scan is a HIDA scan. FNH contains biliary ductules so it should demonstrate radiotracer uptake on a HIDA scan. 


Intrapancreatic splenic tissue 
• The presence of an intrapancreatic splenule can be confirmed by sulfur colloid scan in indeterminate cases, where the suspected tissue will show uptake. A Tc-99m damaged red cell study can also be performed. 

Splenosis: Liver-spleen scan (5.5 mCi Tc-99m sulfur colloid administered) of a patient with history of splenectomy following trauma. 
Anterior and posterior images show 
scattered focal uptake in the abdomen correlating to intraperitoneal soft tissue masses on SPECT/CT (not shown), consistent with splenosis. 


Esophageal and gastric motility 
Radiotracer: Tc-99m sulfur colloid or DTPA 
• Sulfur colloid or DTPA are mixed with food and ingested to assess gastroesophageal motility. 
Esophageal transit 
• 
After a 6-hour or overnight fast, patient is positioned supine and instructed to swallow 10 mL water containing Tc-99m sulfur colloid or DTPA, then attempt dry swallows to clear normal residual activity in the esophagus. This process may be repeated several times. 

• 
Normal esophageal transit time for water is 5–11 seconds, with more than 90% of peak activity clearing the esophagus after 15 seconds. Reduced transit time is seen in patients with scleroderma and achalasia. 


Gastroesophageal reflux 
• 
Scintigraphy for gastroesophageal reflux is most commonly performed in neonates. After an overnight fast, the infant is fed formula or milk mixed with Tc-99m sulfur colloid. Sequential images are acquired to assess for reflux of gastric content into the esophagus. Delayed images of the lungs can be obtained to evaluate for aspiration. 

• 
A similar protocol is used for older children and adults, but using orange juice. 


Salivagram for aspiration 
• Salivagram is more sensitive in detecting aspiration in pediatric patients compared to reflux scintigraphy. A drop of Tc-99m sulfur colloid is placed on the patient’s tongue base or sublingual region to allow mixture with saliva. Rapid images are then obtained to assess for activity in the bronchi and lungs. 

Normal gastric emptying scan: 
1 mCi Tc-99m sulfur colloid mixed in egg whites was administered orally with white bread, jelly and water. Patient consumed 100% of the solid portion. Sample static images at 1 hour and 4 hours show normal gastric retention (1% at 4 hours). The emptying curve shows counts graphed to time.  
• 
After a 6-hour or overnight fast, the patient is given a standardized solid meal containing up to 1 mCi Tc-99m sulfur colloid mixed in scrambled egg whites, along with toast, jam and water. Patient should ingest the entire meal within 10 minutes. Subsequent images of the stomach are then acquired every 60 minutes up to 4 hours. 

• 
Normal residual activity in the stomach at 4 hours is <10%. 

• 
An alternative liquid phase gastric emptying study can be performed using water containing Tc-99m DTPA, with a shorter imaging time because liquids normally empty more rapidly. 





Meckel imaging 
Radiotracer: Tc-99m pertechnetate 
• Technetium-99m pertechnetate localizes to gastric mucosa. 

Meckel diverticulum 
• 
Meckel diverticulum is a remnant of the embryological omphalomesenteric duct, most commonly located in the distal ileum. Approximately 10–60% of Meckel diverticula contain ectopic gastric mucosa, which may result in mucosal damage and GI bleeding. 

• 
A positive Meckel scan demonstrates a focal area of increased activity, typically in the right lower quadrant. A lateral view is often helpful to ensure that activity is anterior and not associated with the ureter. 

• 
Other causes of uptake in the right lower quadrant include appendicitis and intussusception that can cause more diffuse, regional increased activity due to hyperemia. 

• 
Sensitivity of Meckel scan can be increased by a number of medications: Pentagastrin increases uptake of pertechnetate by gastric mucosa. H2 blockers such as cimetidine block release of pertechnetate by the mucosal cells. Glucagon decreases intestinal peristalsis, thereby slows washout of pertechnetate from the diverticulum. 




Gastrointestinal bleeding 
Radiotracer: Tc-99m labeled RBCs 
• Technetium-99m labeled red blood cells are prepared in-vitro by mixing 1–3 mL of anticoagulated blood with stannous chloride and an oxidizing agent; Tc-99m is then added. The labeling efficiency is 95%. The labeling procedure takes more than 20 minutes. 
An in-vivo technique provides much noisier images due to worse labeling efficiency and resultant free pertechnetate, and is therefore uncommonly performed. 
• 
Alternatively, Tc-99m sulfur colloid can be used. Sulfur colloid does not require significant preparation time, but has rapid blood clearance with a vascular half-life of 2–3 minutes. 

• 
A tagged red blood cell study can be used to identify patients who may be suitable for angiography versus those who are not. Bleeding rates as low as 0.05–0.1 mL/min can be detected, compared to 1 mL/min for angiography. 

• 
A positive study shows an initial focus of activity that changes shape or position over time due to antegrade or retrograde peristalsis of intraluminal blood. 



GI bleed: Sequential images of the lower abdomen on Tc-99m tagged RBC study show a focus of radiotracer uptake in the right lower quadrant, in the expected distribution of the superior mesenteric artery, which 

Superior mesenteric artery angiogram in the 
same patient performed within one hour of the above tagged RBC study shows a focus of contrast extravasation in a distal ileocolic branch (arrow). 
This patient was treated with coil embolization of the distal ileocolic branch artery. 


Hepatobiliary imaging (HIDA) 
Radiotracers: Tc-99m IDA agents 
• 
Tc-99m-iminodiacetic acid (IDA) analogs are used to image the biliary system. Regardless of the tracer, the test is typically called a “HIDA” scan. 

• 
Disofenin allows visualization of the biliary system with bilirubin levels as high as 20 mg/ dL and has 90% hepatic uptake. Mebrofenin allows visualization of the biliary system with bilirubin levels as high as 30 mg/dL and has an even higher 98% hepatic uptake. Both are actively transported into hepatocytes but are not conjugated. 

• 
Critical organ is the gallbladder wall. 


HIDA protocol 
• Patient should be NPO for 6 hours prior, but must have eaten within 24 hours. If the patient has been NPO for >24 hours, cholecystokinin (CCK; dose 0.02 µg/kg, given as slow infusion) is given to empty the gallbladder before radiotracer is administered. 
CCK must be administered slowly or the patient may experience an exacerbation of their symptoms. 
• 
Dynamic imaging of the right upper quadrant begins immediately after injection of 5 mCi Tc­99m IDA. As soon as the gallbladder is visualized, acute cholecystitis is ruled out. 

• 
If the gallbladder is not visualized by one hour, morphine is given (0.04 mg/kg, up to a maximum dose of 4 mg) and imaging continues for 30 more minutes. Morphine contracts the sphincter of Oddi, redirecting bile into the cystic duct. 


Morphine should only be given if tracer is visualized in the small bowel, otherwise there is the theoretical risk of worsening a potential common bile duct obstruction. However, nonvisualization of tracer in the small bowel is not specific for common bile duct obstruction. 
• If the patient has a morphine allergy, an alternative is to image for a total of 4 hours.

gallbladder (arrow), 
• Small amount of bile reflux into the and small bowel. stomach can be a normal finding. 
Acute cholecystitis 
• 
Almost all patients with acute cholecystitis have cystic duct obstruction. 

• 
Nonvisualization of the gallbladder after 90 minutes of imaging and morphine augmentation is approximately 86–98% sensitive for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, with a false-positive rate of approximately 6%, most commonly due to pancreatitis and biliary stasis. 

• 
The rim sign describes increased hepatic activity surrounding the gallbladder fossa, thought to be due to hyperemia and is an ancillary finding of acute cholecystitis. 

• 
The cystic duct sign describes a small focus of activity in the cystic duct just proximal to the site of obstruction. 


5 min 15 min 25 min 

Acute cholecystitis: Sequential images from a HIDA scan with 3.87 mCi Tc-99m disofenin administered shows prompt visualization of the liver. The small bowel is visualized by 25 minutes. There is no visualization of the gallbladder during the course of the exam. The patient had a morphine allergy so 4-hour delayed images were obtained instead (not shown), which also do not demonstrate the gallbladder. 
• False positive HIDA (gallbladder nonvisualization without acute cholecystitis) can be due to: 
Recent meal (within 4 hours) or prolonged fasting (greater than 24 hours). Administration of CCK immediately prior to the exam, which can cause persistent sphincter of Oddi relaxation. Total parenteral nutrition.  Pancreatitis. Severe illness. Chronic cholecystitis. Cholangiocarcinoma of the cystic duct (very rare).  

• False negative HIDA (gallbladder visualization with acute cholecystitis) is very rare and can be due to: 
Acalculous cholecystitis with a patent cystic duct. Duodenal diverticulum simulating the gallbladder; however, a lateral view would differentiate. Choledochal cyst simulating the gallbladder. Right extrarenal pelvis in jaundiced patients with increased renal excretion of tracer. 

Chronic cholecystitis 
• 
Chronic cholecystitis is long-standing gallbladder inflammation causing loss of normal gallbladder function, predisposing to formation of stones. 

• 
Chronic cholecystitis may be a cause of chronic recurrent abdominal pain. 

• 
Diagnosis can be difficult as there is no single pattern that is pathognomonic of chronic cholecystitis based on HIDA. In fact, most cases of chronic cholecystitis have a normal HIDA. 

• 
A low gallbladder ejection fraction (GBEF) is thought to be suggestive of chronic cholecystitis. To measure the ejection fraction, pre- and post-CCK injection gallbladder counts are compared. A GBEF <35% suggests chronic cholecystitis, although the reliability of this finding is controversial as ejection fraction is dependent on the rate of CCK injection and standard infusion protocols have not been determined. 



Biliary obstruction 
• 
Acute high-grade obstruction of the common bile duct can result in the liver scan sign, where there is uptake in the liver but no visualization of the biliary tree or small bowel. Intrahepatic cholestasis or hepatitis can have a similar appearance. 

• 
Delayed clearance of activity from the common bile duct suggests partial obstruction. 



Hepatic dysfunction 

Severe hepatic dysfunction in a patient with 
cholangiocarcinoma: 
Single image from a HIDA obtained 30 minutes after 
6.1 mCi Tc-99m disofenin administered shows a large amount of background and blood pool uptake with minimal tracer in the liver. A large photopenic defect in the left lobe of the liver (arrows) corresponds to the patient’s cholangiocarcinoma. There is small bowel tracer excretion. 
• 
Since the IDA tracers are actively transported into hepatocytes and then secreted into the bile, severe hepatic dysfunction will cause very poor hepatic uptake and blood pool clearance will be delayed. 

• 
Since functioning hepatocytes are necessary to extract the tracer, a hepatic mass will appear as a focal photopenic defect.
