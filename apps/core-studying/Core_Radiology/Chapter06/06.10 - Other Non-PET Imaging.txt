Other non-PET imaging 
Lymphoscintigraphy 
• 
For cancers that metastasize first to regional lymph nodes, such as melanoma and breast carcinoma, lymphoscintigraphy can be used to identify the sentinel lymph node required for tumor staging. Filtered Tc-99m sulfur colloid is injected in the peritumoral region, subsequent images allow mapping of lymphatic drainage from the tumor. The first node visualized is the sentinel node. A gamma probe can be used intraoperatively during the same-day surgery to localize the sentinel node for excision. 

• 
Lymphoscintigraphy is also utilized in the diagnosis of lymphedema. Lymphatic drainage in the involved extremity is visualized after interdigital injection of the radiotracer. Obstructive lymphedema presents as delayed migration of activity from the injection site, diffuse dermal backflow uptake, dilated and collateral lymphatic channels. 


Molecular breast imaging 
• 
Technetium-99m sestamibi concentrates in breast cancers and can be used as a problem-solving adjunct to mammography and ultrasound, particularly in women with dense breast tissue. 

• 
Normal breast has low, homogeneous or patchy uptake. Focal uptake in the breast or axilla is suspicious for malignancy. 

• 
Molecular breast imaging with Tc-99m sestamibi has high sensitivity and specificity (80–90%). However, radiation dose to the breast remains a disadvantage. 


Radionuclide testicular imaging 
• 
Historically, testicular imaging with technetium-99m pertechnetate has been used in the diagnosis of testicular torsion. The radiotracer is injected intravenously, immediate dynamic imaging of the anterior pelvis is then obtained, followed by delayed static images. 

• 
Normal testes show symmetric homogeneous uptake. Decreased perfusion or focal photopenia on the symptomatic side is diagnostic of torsion. Increased perfusion suggests hyperemia, which is seen in epididymitis/orchitis. 

• 
Although radionuclide imaging is more sensitive for testicular torsion, it is slower and less readily available compared to scrotal ultrasound.
