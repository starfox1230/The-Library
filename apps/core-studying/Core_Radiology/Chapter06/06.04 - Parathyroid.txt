Parathyroid 
Radiotracer 
Tc-99m sestamibi 
• 
Tc-99m sestamibi localizes to the mitochondria in parathyroid adenomas, hyperplastic parathyroids, normal thyroid tissue, and thyroid adenomas; however, thyroid activity decreases over time. It is not taken up by normal functioning parathyroid tissue. 

• 
The same agent is used for nuclear cardiology and can also be taken up by malignancy, particularly breast and lung cancers. 




Indications 
Parathyroid adenoma 

Early anterior pinhole image of the thyroid after the administration of 5 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi shows diffuse uptake throughout the thyroid, with a focal area of increased uptake (arrow) in the lower pole of the right lobe. 
• 
Dual-phase (early and delayed) imaging with Tc-99m sestamibi can localize a suspected parathyroid adenoma in a patient with elevated parathyroid hormone. 

• A parathyroid adenoma shows increased uptake on early images and persistent retained activity on delayed images. In contrast, a thyroid adenoma will also initially show increased uptake but will then wash out on delayed images. 

• 
Parathyroid tissue does not take up Tc-99m pertechnetate, which can be administered in indeterminate cases. 

• 
SPECT/CT imaging is also frequently performed to provide more precise localization of uptake to aid in presurgical planning. 


Delayed anterior pinhole image shows interval partial washout of Tc-99m sestamibi. There is a persistent focus of radiotracer uptake (arrow) in the right lower pole. A right inferior parathyroid adenoma was confirmed at surgery.
