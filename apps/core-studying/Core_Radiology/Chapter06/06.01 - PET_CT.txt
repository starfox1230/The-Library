Basic positron emission tomography (PET) physics 
• A positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer emits a positron that travels a small 
local distance within the tissue. After meeting an electron, both the positron and electron annihilate and create two 511 keV photons travelling nearly 180 degrees apart. 
• The two high-energy photons travelling in opposite directions are simultaneously detected by a circular ring of crystals, which can determine that the two photons arrived coincidentally. 

Technical considerations of F-18 FDG PET/CT 
Radiotracer: Fluorine-18 FDG 

• 
Fluorine-18 (F-18) is a cyclotron-produced positron emitter, half-life 110 minutes. 

• 
F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18 FDG) is a glucose analog that competes with glucose for transport into cells by the GLUT 1 and 3 transporters. After becoming phosphorylated by hexokinase, FDG-phosphate cannot undergo glycolysis and is effectively trapped within cells. 


Radiotracer uptake quantifi cation 
• 
The standardized uptake value (SUV) roughly quantifies FDG uptake. 

• 
SUV is proportional to (ROI activity * body weight) / administered activity. 

• 
SUV of a region of interest can vary significantly depending on multiple factors including the specific equipment used, time elapsed after FDG administration, the presence of any tracer extravasation, blood glucose and insulin levels at time of injection, etc. 

• 
An SUV value above 2.5 traditionally has been suggestive of malignancy. However, malignancy can never be definitively diagnosed or excluded using SUV as the sole criterion. 

• 
Size threshold for lesion detection on FDG PET is 6 mm. For small lesions, the average SUV may be falsely low due to partial volume averaging; the maximum SUV is a better measure. 

• 
An alternative approach to calculating SUV values is visual or quantitative assessment of FDG uptake relative to background activity in normal tissues (e.g., liver or cerebellum) or the mediastinal blood pool. 



CT correlation 
• 
Most modern PET studies are performed together with CT as a PET/CT. One important exception is in the pediatric population, where PET may be performed in isolation to reduce the risk of radiation exposure from CT. 

• 
The CT exam is often performed with a lower dose than a diagnostic-quality CT. The CT protocol varies by institution (e.g., whether intravenous contrast is administered). 

• 
The CT is used for anatomic localization and attenuation correction. 

• 
Very dense retained oral contrast or dense metallic objects (such as joint prostheses) may cause artifactual FDG uptake due to miscalculation of attenuation correction. 


Patient preparation 
• 
The uptake of FDG in both normal and pathological tissues is dependent on the serum glucose and insulin levels. 

• 
Elevated insulin levels will cause increased muscle uptake and decrease the sensitivity for detecting mildly FDG-avid lesions. 

• 
Patients should be NPO for at least 4 hours to allow insulin to reach a basal level. 


In type 1 diabetes, imaging should be performed in the morning after an overnight fast. Insulin is not recommended. In type 2 diabetes, regular insulin should be held 2–4 hours prior to the study. Short-acting insulin can 
be used but is not recommended. There is no need to hold long-acting insulin and oral hypoglycemic medications such as Metformin, though the latter can increase bowel uptake. 
• 
Blood glucose should be below 200 mg/dL, preferably below 150. Elevated serum glucose will result in decreased FDG uptake by tumors and the brain. 

• 
The typical administered dose of F-18 FDG is 10–25 mCi. After intravenous injection, the 


patient should rest in a quiet room for 60 minutes before imaging. If the patient talks, the vocal cords may show FDG uptake. If the patient walks, the muscles may show FDG uptake. 

Normal FDG distribution 
• Brain: The brain has intense FDG uptake. Brains love sugar! 
Despite intense uptake, with appropriate windowing, excellent detail of the cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum can be seen. 
• 
Renal, ureters, and bladder: FDG is concentrated in the urine, with very intense activity in the renal collecting system, ureters, and bladder. As a result, bladder is the critical organ (the body part most susceptible to radiation damage from a given isotope). Good hydration is recommended for clearance of radioactivity. 

• 
Salivary glands, tonsils, thyroid: Mild to moderate symmetric uptake. 

• 
Liver: Moderate, largely homogeneous uptake. 

• 
Bowel: Diffuse mild to moderate uptake is normal. Focal uptake within the bowel, however, 


should be regarded with suspicion. Metformin can increase colonic, and to a lesser extent, small bowel FDG uptake and may mask a lesion. 
• 
Heart: Uptake is often variable, depending on insulin/glucose levels and the patient’s fasting state. The heart prefers fatty acids but will use glucose in the postprandial state. 

• 
Muscles: FDG uptake is normally low. However, elevated insulin levels or recent exercise can cause increased muscle uptake. 

• 
Brown fat: Brown fat is metabolically active adipose tissue that can be found in the supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal and paravertebral regions in adults that can be mildly to moderately FDG avid, especially if the patient is cold or after food intake. 



Oncologic indications of F-18 FDG PET/CT 
Lung cancer 

Lung cancer initial staging: Fused axial PET/CT (left image) and coronal PET MIP (right image) show an intensely FDG-avid right upper lobe mass (blue arrow) representing the patient's primary bronchogenic carcinoma. There were no enlarged or FDG-avid hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes, and no FDG-avid distant metastases. Also note normal biodistribution of FDG in the other organs. 
• 
PET/CT plays a role both in the initial staging of patients with lung cancer, and in evaluating response to treatment. 

• 
For initial staging, PET/CT is most useful in evaluating local tumor extension and searching for distant metastases. Approximately 10% of patients with a negative metastatic workup by CT will have PET evidence of metastasis. 

• 
PET/CT also plays a role in the initial detection of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. Although PET is very sensitive for detecting malignant lymph nodes, it is not specific. Mediastinoscopy is the gold standard for lymph node staging. Given the lack of PET specificity, PET-positive mediastinal nodes must be followed by mediastinoscopy before potentially curative surgery is denied based solely on the PET. 


Solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) 
• 
Evaluation of a suspicious solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) is an indication for PET/CT. 

• 
Depending on the equipment used, 5–8 mm is typically the smallest size for a nodule that can be reliably evaluated by PET. 

• 
The majority of malignant SPNs are FDG-avid. However, low-grade tumors such as lung adenocarcinoma or carcinoid may not be metabolically active and may be falsely negative on PET. 

• 
Conversely, the majority of benign SPNs are not FDG-avid. Active granulomatous disease (including tuberculosis) may take up FDG, thus falsely positive on PET. 

• 
It is never possible to definitively diagnose a nodule as benign or malignant based on SUV value alone. 

• 
In general, if a nodule is not FDG-avid, short-term follow-up is reasonable. If the nodule is FDG-avid then biopsy or resection is preferred. 


Colon cancer 

Metastatic rectosigmoid cancer: Fused axial PET/CT through the lungs (top left image), through the pelvis (bottom left image), and a sagittal PET MIP (right image) show the intensely FDG-avid primary rectosigmoid malignancy (blue arrows), with numerous pulmonary metastases. Note the physiologic intense activity in the renal collecting system, bladder and ureters (green arrows). 
• 
PET/CT has a limited role in determining local extent of colon cancer due to poor spatial resolution and physiologic bowel uptake, but it does play a primary role in evaluating metastatic disease in colorectal malignancies. In particular, since an isolated hepatic metastasis can be resected or ablated, evaluation for extrahepatic metastases is a common indication for PET/CT. 

• 
After initial treatment, follow-up PET/CT is usually delayed approximately two months due to increased FDG uptake in the peritreatment period related to inflammation that can occur. 



Head and neck cancer 
• 
PET/CT is often used in the initial staging of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, especially for evaluation of regional nodal metastases. 

• 
Specificity for evaluating recurrent disease after chemoradiation is limited due to altered anatomy and inflammation from treatment. Usually post-treatment scans should be delayed 4 months after treatment. 


Thyroid cancer 

Iodine-resistant thyroid cancer: Fused axial PET/CT (top left image), non-contrast CT (bottom left image), and coronal PET MIP show several moderately FDG-avid right cervical and paratracheal lymph nodes and a single intensely FDG-avid left paratracheal node (arrows). There is symmetric physiologic salivary gland uptake seen on the coronal MIP. I-131 scan (not shown) was negative. 
• Undifferentiated or medullary thyroid cancers may not take up radioiodine but may be FDG avid. PET/CT is used in the clinical setting of a rising thyroglobulin level with negative whole-body radioiodine scans. 
Lymphoma 
• 
PET/CT plays a key role in the staging and restaging of patients with lymphoma. 

• 
Most histological types of lymphoma, including Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, are FDG-avid. Low-grade lymphomas, such as small lymphocytic and mantle cell lymphoma, however, tend to be less FDG-avid. 

• 
Increased marrow uptake in lymphoma patients can be difficult to interpret. Diffuse marrow uptake may be due to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) stimulation, rebound effect from chemotherapy, or malignant marrow infiltration. Focal increased uptake, however, is more likely to represent lymphoma. 



Breast cancer 
• 
Although used in the staging and response to therapy of recurrent or stage IV breast cancer, standard PET/CT is not used to evaluate small nodal metastases. 

• 
PET/CT is not routinely used for patients with stage I–III breast cancer. 


Esophageal cancer 

Non-metastatic esophageal cancer: Fused axial PET/CT (top left image) and sagittal PET MIP (right image) show a single focus of intense FDG uptake within the distal esophagus (blue arrows). Marked esophageal thickening is also apparent on the non-contrast CT (bottom left image). There is no evidence of metastatic disease. The focus of FDG uptake within the heart on the fused image is physiologic myocardial uptake. Note the presence of a small paraesophageal hernia (yellow arrow). 
• 
The primary role of PET/CT in the evaluation of esophageal cancer is to identify patients with stage IV disease who are not surgical candidates. PET/CT is limited for primary tumor staging of esophageal cancer, which is better assessed with endoscopic ultrasound. 

• 
After initial neoadjuvant treatment, a decrease in FDG avidity by at least 30% suggests a more favorable prognosis. In contrast, those patients who do not show a decrease in FDG uptake can potentially be spared ineffective chemotherapy regimens. 



Cancers where F-18 FDG PET/CT plays a limited role 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
• Only 50% of HCCs can be imaged with FDG-PET due to relatively high levels of phosphatase compared to other cancers which dephosphorylates FDG and allows it to diffuse out of cells. 
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and bladder cancer 
• 
Only 50% of RCCs are FDG-avid, though PET may play a role in detecting metastatic disease. 

• 
Detection of ureteral or bladder lesions is extremely limited due to surrounding high urinary FDG activity. 



Prostate cancer 
• 
Most prostate cancers have low FDG uptake. 

• 
FDG-PET is reserved for assessing treatment response of bony metastases in aggressive castration-resistant prostate cancer and as a prognostic indicator. 



Other tumors 
• Well-differentiated or mucinous cell type tumors, lung adenocarcinoma, and carcinoid tumors tend to have low FDG uptake or are non-FDG-avid. 

Other types of PET/CT 
Gallium-68 DOTATATE (GaTate) 
• 
Gallium-68 is a generator-produced positron emitter with a half-life of 68 minutes. 

• 
Ga-68 DOTATATE is a somatostatin analog that is used in the imaging of tumors with high somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expression, including neuroendocrine tumors, pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, neuroblastoma, and meningioma. 

• 
DOTATATE PET/CT is the new first-line diagnostic imaging modality for neuroendocrine tumors, replacing the older Octreoscan and MIBG scintigraphy (discussed later in this chapter). 

• 
DOTATATE and FDG PET/CT are complementary exams, helping to identify both well-differentiated (high DOTATATE uptake) and poorly differentiated (high FDG uptake) tumors. 


PET agents for prostate cancer imaging 
• 
Because of the limitation of FDG PET/CT in prostate cancer imaging, a number of alternative PET radiotracers have been developed in the past decade. 

• 
Carbon-11/F-18 choline are biomarkers of cell membrane metabolism and are FDA-approved for imaging biochemically recurrent prostate cancer with high PSA levels, but are not in widespread use. 

• 
PSMA ligands such as ProstaScint and Ga-68 PSMA target the prostate membrane specific antigen (PSMA) which is highly expressed in prostate cancer. PSMA PET/CT is highly sensitive for biochemically recurrent prostate cancer with low PSA levels, but is not yet FDA-approved. 

• 
F-18 fluciclovine (Axumin) is an amino acid analog which targets amino acid transporters that are 


overexpressed in prostate cancer. Imaging is performed only minutes after injection of the tracer, which limits any significant urinary excretion. It is FDA-approved for detection of biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. 

• F-18 sodium fluoride (F-18 NaF) is an analog of the hydroxyl group in hydroxyapatite bone crystals and a biomarker of osteoblastic activity. It is highly sensitive for the detection of prostate cancer bone metastases, but is not routinely used due to low specificity, high cost, and limited availability.
