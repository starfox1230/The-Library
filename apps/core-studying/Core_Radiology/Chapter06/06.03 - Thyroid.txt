Thyroid 
Radiotracers 
Iodine-131 
• 
I-131 emits both beta particles and 364 keV gamma photons (only the gamma photons are used for imaging). The half-life is 8 days. I-131 is produced by fission in a nuclear reactor. It is administered orally. 

• 
I-131 is ideal for therapy due to its high radiation dose to the thyroid and relatively low whole body dose. Indications include treatment of thyroid cancer status post thyroidectomy, and hyperthyroidism from Graves disease or multinodular goiter. 



Iodine-123 
• 
I-123 decays by electron capture and emits 159 keV gamma photons. The half-life is 13 hours. I-123 is expensive because it is produced by cyclotron. It is administered orally. 

• 
I-123 is the preferred radioisotope for thyroid imaging, as it can image in high detail and obtain thyroid uptake values. 


Tc-99m pertechnetate 
• 
Tc-99m emits 140 keV gamma photons, has a half-life of 6 hours, and is generator-produced. 

• 
Unlike iodine, pertechnetate is trapped but not organified by the thyroid. After initial uptake it is released into the blood pool. Thyroid uptake is not routinely quantified with pertechnetate due to its rapid washout. 

• 
Pertechnetate is an excellent alternative to I-123 for thyroid imaging because of its ready availability from generators, and its low patient dose which allows administration of higher doses and thereby permits quicker imaging with less motion artifact. It is administered intravenously. 

• 
Because pertechnetate does not specifically localize to the thyroid, high background counts are typical. Only 1–5% of administered activity is taken up by the thyroid. 

• 
In contrast to I-123, the salivary glands are well seen with pertechnetate. 

• 
Tc-99m pertechnetate is preferred over I-123 when the patient has received recent intravenous iodinated contrast (iodine in contrast blocks thyroid uptake of additional iodine), when IV administration is necessary, or when a quick study is required.

Patient preparation 
• 
Patients undergoing I-123 or I-131 imaging/therapy must have non-suppressed TSH, which can be achieved by stopping exogenous thyroid hormone for 4 weeks, or by two intramuscular injections of recombinant TSH (rTSH). 

• 
Patients who received intravenous iodinated contrast should wait one month before radioiodine imaging. 



Pregnancy and breastfeeding 
• 
All thyrotropic agents cross the placenta and I-131 is contraindicated in pregnancy. Fetal iodine is taken up beginning at 12 weeks of gestation. 

• 
A breastfeeding mother who requires an I-131 ablative dose must stop breastfeeding permanently for the current child. 

• 
For I-123, breastfeeding can be resumed two to three days after administration. 

• 
For Tc-99m, breastfeeding can be resumed 12–24 hours after administration. 




Diagnostic Indications (I-123 or Tc-99m pertechnetate) 
Ectopic thyroid 
• 
Either I-123 or Tc-99m can be used to localize suspected ectopic thyroid tissue. 

• 
Lingual thyroid is ectopic thyroid tissue at the base of the tongue. 

• 
Functional thyroid tissue may rarely be seen in an ovarian teratoma (struma ovarii). 

• 
Retrosternal thyroid tissue is most often due to a substernal goiter. 


Thyroid nodule 
• 
Thyroid nodules are typically only imaged if the cytology is indeterminate. 

• 
Hyperfunctioning nodules are almost always benign adenomas. 

• 
Cold nodules have approximately 20% risk of malignancy, although the most common cold nodule (~70–75%) is a benign colloid cyst. 

• 
A warm nodule usually represents a cold nodule with overlapping thyroid tissue. A warm nodule requires further investigation such as biopsy if oblique views are indeterminate. 

• 
A discordant thyroid nodule is “hot” on Tc-99m and “cold” on I-123 as it has maintained the ability to trap pertechnetate but is unable to organify iodine. Biopsy is usually recommended as a discordant nodule may be malignant. 



Graves disease 

Graves disease on I-123 scan with 0.3 mCi I-123 NaI administered. 
There is diffuse uptake throughout the thyroid gland. A faint pyramidal lobe is present (arrow). 
24-hour uptake is elevated at 56%. 
• 
Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by hyperthyroidism, thyromegaly, homogeneously increased thyroid activity, and often a prominent pyramidal lobe. 

• 
Both 6-hour and 24-hour iodine uptake are elevated. Normal 6-hour uptake is 6–18% and normal 24–hour uptake is 10–30%. 

• 
Although usually an I-123 and a Tc-99m scan can be differentiated by the presence of salivary uptake with Tc-99m, in Graves disease this distinction is often not possible. In Graves disease, thyroid uptake can be so strong that the salivary glands are often not seen, causing a similar appearance with either radiotracer. 



Graves disease (continued) 
• Definitive treatment of Graves disease is I-131 radiotherapy or (less commonly) surgery. Antithyroid drugs (e.g., methimazole or propylthiouracil) are another option and may achieve a remission after one to two years of use. 
Toxic multinodular goiter (Plummer disease) 
• 
Patients with toxic multinodular goiter are often middle-aged to elderly women and present with symptoms of hyperthyroidism. 

• 
Thyroid scan shows an irregular, nodular thyroid contour and heterogeneous uptake corresponding to single or multiple hot nodules with suppression of the remaining normal functioning thyroid. Iodine uptake is elevated. 

• 
Treatment options include medical therapy with antithyroid drugs for thyrotoxicosis, I-131 ablation, or thyroidectomy. 

• 
Malignancy is relatively uncommon in a multinodular goiter. While a dominant cold nodule should undergo further investigation, smaller cold nodules are unlikely to be malignant. 


Hashimoto thyroiditis 
• 
Hashimoto thyroiditis is the most common inflammatory disease of the thyroid. 

• 
Like Graves disease, Hashimoto thyroiditis also clinically presents with thyromegaly. In Hashimoto thyroiditis, however, thyroid hormone levels are variable depending on the disease stage. Most patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis are hypothyroid. 

• 
Appearance on thyroid scan is variable, ranging from diffusely increased activity that resembles Graves disease to patchy uptake similar to a multinodular goiter. The patchiness is thought to be due to cold areas from infiltration by lymphocytes and lymphoid follicles. 



Subacute thyroiditis 

Subacute thyroiditis on I-123 scan with 0.22 mCi administered. 
There is diffusely low thyroid uptake with very low background to thyroid uptake ratio. 24-hour uptake was only 4.9%. 
• 
The classical clinical presentation of subacute thyroiditis is a painful swollen gland, although many patients present with silent hyperthyroidism. 

• 
Imaging shows decreased radiotracer uptake and a low 24-hour uptake. 

• 
Subacute thyroiditis is typically a self-limited condition. Treatment is directed towards symptom control with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or steroids in severe cases. 




Therapeutic indications (I–131) 
Thyroid carcinoma, post-thyroidectomy 
• Approximately one to two months after thyroidectomy, I-131 is administered 
to treat and simultaneously image 
residual and potential metastatic disease. 
• Following thyroidectomy, thyroid replacement therapy is withheld to 
allow endogenous TSH to increase. This increases uptake of therapeutic I-131 by any residual or metastatic thyroid tissue. The goal TSH is 30–50 mIU/mL. 
• The dosing of I-131 is dependent on the oncologic risk: 
Low-risk patient (tumor <1.5 cm, no invasion of thyroid capsule): =30 mCi I-131 administered. 
High-risk patient: 100–200 mCi I-131 administered. 
• 
A new approach is a standard dose of 30 mCi for treatment of all T1, T2, and N1 cancers. 

• 
Functioning lung or skeletal metastases require high doses of I-131, usually >200 mCi. 

• 
To avoid or minimize the complication of irreversible pulmonary fibrosis, care is taken to limit the whole-body retention to 80 mCi at 48 hours after administration. To avoid bone marrow suppression, the absorbed dose to the blood is limited to 2 Gy. 


Thyroid carcinoma, post radioiodine therapy 
• After ablation with I-131, patients with thyroid carcinoma are monitored by following thyroglobulin levels. If thyroglobulin levels rise, an I-123 scan is performed to evaluate for disease recurrence or metastasis. If the I-123 scan is positive, repeat I-131 radioiodine is administered for ablation. Note that the presence of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies precludes the ability to monitor the thyroglobulin levels. 

Treatment of Graves disease 
• 
I-131 is administered in a single oral dose to treat Graves disease. Contraindications to I-131 include pregnancy, lactation, and inability to comply with radiation safety guidelines. 

• 
The dosing of I-131 for treatment of Graves varies by institution. Many endocrinologists advocate a calculated dose based on the estimated thyroid weight and 24-hour uptake, while another study has shown one of three fixed doses (up to 15 mCi) to be equally effective. 

• 
Adequate dosing of I-131 can treat greater than 90% of patients with Graves disease. 


Treatment of multinodular goiter 
• I-131 can be used to reduce goiter size, especially in patients who choose not to undergo surgery. Compared to Graves disease, toxic multinodular goiter is more resistant to iodine radiotherapy, therefore requires a higher I-131 dose (20–30 mCi) and often multiple treatments. 

Treatment of toxic/autonomous nodule 
• Solitary toxic thyroid nodules can be successfully treated with 20–25 mCi of I-131.
