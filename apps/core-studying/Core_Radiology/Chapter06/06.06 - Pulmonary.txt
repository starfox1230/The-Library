Biliary leak 

Bile leak: Sequential images (top row) and two enlarged still images (bottom two images) from a HIDA scan with 5.4 mCi Tc-99m disofenin administered to a patient with right upper quadrant pain status post cholecystectomy shows tracer accumulating in the gallbladder fossa (yellow arrow) and pooling in the right paracolic gutter (blue arrow). The gallbladder is surgically absent. The leak was thought to arise from the cystic duct stump. 
• A HIDA scan is an accurate method to assess for the presence of a biliary leak. Imaging can be performed in the right lateral decubitus position to promote dependent pooling of bile. 
Pulmonary 
Radiotracers 
Tc-99m MAA (perfusion) 
• 
Technetium-99m macro-aggregated albumin (MAA) is a particulate radiopharmaceutical that lodges in the pulmonary capillary bed and can therefore be used to evaluate pulmonary perfusion. Most particles are between 10–30 µm in size. 

• 
Typically 3–5 mCi Tc-99m MAA are administered intravenously, comprising between 200,000 and 600,000 particles. Particles begin to break down in approximately 30 minutes. In children, pregnant patients, patients with mild pulmonary hypertension, and patients with a known right-to-left shunt, the dose can be halved to approximately 100,000 particles. 

• 
A relative contraindication to MAA is severe pulmonary hypertension, as obstruction of even a few pulmonary capillaries can cause clinical worsening. 

•A 
right-to-left shunt causes immediate renal and brain uptake after intravenous injection. A Tc-99m MAA study may be able to quantify the shunt fraction in these patients. Note that renal uptake can also be seen if free pertechnetate is present, but evaluation of the head and neck can differentiate free pertechnetate from a right-to-left shunt. Free pertechnetate is taken up by the thyroid, but not the brain. A right-to-left shunt, in contrast, demonstrates immediate brain uptake and no significant uptake in the neck. 

• 
Clumping of MAA can be seen when MAA is inadvertently drawn back into injection syringe, causing coagulation with the patient’s blood.

Xenon-133 (ventilation) 
• 
Xenon-133 is an inhaled gas with a physical half-life of 5.3 days, which emits 81 keV gamma photons and is also a beta-emitter. The critical organ is the trachea. The biologic half-life is very short because the vast majority of the gas is exhaled. Although 10–20 mCi is administered, there is very little radiation exposure. 

• 
Xenon-133 is imaged posteriorly to avoid breast artifacts, as the relatively low keV is easily attenuated by soft tissue. Wash-in/washout imaging can be performed to evaluate for air trapping, which is seen in COPD. 

• 
Xenon-133 requires good patient cooperation as the patient must breathe on a closed spirometer for several minutes. Exhaled xenon-133 must be carefully disposed of, either exhausted to the atmosphere or trapped in a charcoal trap until it decays. Xenon-133 must be administered in a negative pressure room to prevent accidental leakage. 

• 
Because xenon-133 is soluble in fat, it can accumulate in the liver, particularly a fatty liver. 



Tc-99m DTPA (ventilation) 
• 
Tc-99m DTPA is a technetium-labeled aerosol. Unlike Xenon-133, DTPA does not allow for dynamic wash-in/washout imaging. Once inhaled, the particles remain in place for approximately 45–60 minutes (20 minutes in smokers). 30 mCi is typically administered. 

• 
Compared to xenon, Tc99m DTPA has greater ease of use. Specific advantages include the ability to image in multiple projections, little requirement for patient cooperation, no need for exhaust systems, ability to use portably and be delivered through mechanical ventilation. 

• 
Swallowed activity can be seen in the esophagus and stomach. 




Clinical V/Q Scanning in the era of CT pulmonary angiography 
Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in pregnancy 
• Pulmonary embolism is the leading cause of death in pregnancy in the developed world, and diagnosis must be weighed against radiation exposure to the mother and the fetus. 
CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA): Maternal breast dose approximately 10–70 mGy (much greater than ACR mammography guidelines of 3 mGy/breast). Fetal dose 0.01–0.66 mGy. 
V/Q scan: Maternal breast dose <1.5 mGy. Fetal dose 0.5–1.1 mGy (higher than CTPA but still considerably lower than the 100 mSv threshold for potential teratogenic effects). 
Low-dose perfusion (Q) scan: Maternal breast dose 0.6 mGy. Fetal dose 0.1–0.2 mGy. 
• 
In most cases, only perfusion scan is necessary and ventilation scan is not commonly performed. The administered dose of Tc-99m MAA is typically one-half of the standard dose, or approximately 100,000 particles. 

• 
Diagnostic accuracy for PE has been shown to be equivalent between CTPA and Q scan. 

• 
The primary advantage of CTPA is the demonstration of an alternative diagnosis not seen on plain radiographs approximately 5% of the time and a lower fetal dose, at the expense of increased breast radiation exposure. 

• 
Nuclear medicine perfusion scan should be reserved for suspected pulmonary embolism in a pregnant patient with a normal chest radiograph, no history of asthma or COPD, and a negative duplex ultrasound of lower extremities. In clinical practice, CTPA is more readily available and often the prefered modality.

Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism with PIOPED II 
High probability: Specificity for pulmonary embolism 97%, positive predictive value 88% 

High probability for pulmonary embolism: RPO perfusion images (same image, without and with annotations) after 4.7 mCi Tc-99m MAA administered show two large segmental defects in the posterior basal (red) and anterior basal (brown) segments of the right lower lobe. The ventilation scan (not shown) was normal. 
• Two or more large mismatched segmental defects without associated radiographic abnormality denote high probability for pulmonary embolism. 
Intermediate probability: Not clinically helpful, further imaging is required 
• 
One large segmental mismatched perfusion defect denotes intermediate probability. 

• 
A triple matched defect in the lower lung is considered an intermediate probability. A triple matched defect describes a defect on perfusion, a matched defect on ventilation, and a corresponding abnormality on the chest radiograph. 


Low probability: Negative predictive value 84% 
• 
A single large or moderate matched V/Q defect is low probability of pulmonary embolism. 

• 
Other low probability results are absent perfusion of an entire lung, or more than three small segmental lesions. 


Very low probability 
• 
Nonsegmental defects denote very low probability. 

• 
The stripe sign peripheral to a perfusion defect denotes very low probability for pulmonary embolism. The stripe sign represents a thin line of MAA uptake between a perfusion defect and the adjacent pleural surface, representing intervening perfused lung. 

• 
A solitary triple-matched defect in the mid-to-upper lung denotes very low probability. In contrast, the previously mentioned triple-matched defect in the lower lung is more likely to represent PE and is considered an intermediate probability finding. 


Normal 
• If the perfusion scan is normal, the exam is normal and the ventilation study is not required.
