Radiotracers 
Tc-99m DTPA 
• 
DTPA can measure glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and evaluate renal perfusion. 

• 
DTPA is excreted by glomerular filtration. Approximately 20% is extracted by the glomerulus into the tubules with each pass. This is the identical extraction fraction as inulin, which is used to exactly measure GFR. 



Tc-99m MAG3 
• 
MAG3 can estimate renal plasma flow and evaluate renal perfusion, however MAG3 cannot measure GFR. 

• 
MAG3 is filtered and excreted by the tubules. Greater than 50% is extracted by the glomerulus into the tubules with each pass. MAG3 is cleared predominantly by the proximal tubules with minimal filtration. It has a higher extraction fraction than DTPA, which provides better images in patients with renal insufficiency or obstruction. 



Tc-99m DMSA 
• 
DMSA scanning is performed in children to evaluate for the presence of renal scarring associated with pyelonephritis. The collecting system is not imaged. 

• 
DMSA is a specialized cortical agent. It is bound in the renal tubules, which allows anatomic imaging of the cortex. It is the only renal tracer where SPECT imaging is performed. 




Clinical applications of renal imaging 
Renogram 
• A nuclear renogram is a time-activity curve that provides a graphical representation of renal uptake and excretion. Approximately 10 mCi Tc-99m MAG3 (most commonly) or DTPA is administered. A normal renogram has three phases: 
1) Flow or perfusion phase has a sharp upslope and lasts ~1 minute after injection. Normal kidneys are visualized within 2–5 seconds following visualization of the aorta. A slow upslope suggests decreased perfusion. 
2) Cortical function phase usually occurs in the first 1–3 minutes, peaks at 3–5 minutes (= time to peak activity). Decreased renal function produces delayed cortical uptake. 
3) Clearance phase is characterized by rapid urine excretion into the collecting system, which usually begins after 3 minutes. Normally half of the renal activity should be cleared in 8–12 minutes (= half-time excretion). Lack of pelvicalyceal clearance suggests obstruction.

Renogram (continued) 
• 
Differential (or split) renal function is determined during the cortical phase by counting the % activity in each kidney, which should be equal. Normal range is 45–55% for each kidney. 

• 
Cortical transit of radiotracer can be quantified by the 20 minute-to-peak ratio, which describes the percentage of maximal cortical activity remaining in each kidney at 20 minutes after injection. A ratio <0.3 is normal. Delayed transit reflects renal dysfunction. 


Lasix renogram (diuretic renography) 
• 
If hydronephrosis is present, a diuretic renogram can distinguish between obstruction and a nonobstructive cause of collecting system dilation. Both renal function and urodynamics are evaluated. The radiotracer is Tc-99m MAG3, much less commonly Tc-99m DTPA. 

• 
After approximately 20 minutes of imaging, 40 mg IV furosemide (Lasix) is administered. A higher dose may be needed in patients with renal insufficiency. After infection, a fixed mechanical obstruction will show no change in the renogram curve. However, in a non-obstructive case, the additional pressure from diuretic effect will open up the collecting system and allow drainage of radiotracer from the kidney. 



After administration of Lasix, a clearance half-time <10 minutes is normal. 
10–20 minutes is indeterminant. 
>20 minutes suggests obstruction. 
• 
False positives (Lasix renogram is positive for obstruction in the absence of a true obstruction) can be seen within dehydration, distended bladder, or renal failure (decreased response to diuretics). 

• 
Ethacrynic acid is an alternative diuretic to Lasix in patients with sulfa allergies, though in practice Lasix is only associated with negligible risk of adverse reactions in these patients. 


Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor renogram 
• A positive ACE renogram is relatively specific for renal artery stenosis, which may be a cause of hypertension. The radiotracer is Tc-99m MAG3, much less commonly Tc-99m DTPA. 
• In compensated renal artery stenosis, decreased blood to the glomerulus stimulates renin • angiotensin I . angiotensin II. Angiotensin II constricts the efferent (outgoing) arterioles to restore GFR. Angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin converting enzyme. 
decreased infow in renin-angiotensin system compensates by renal artery stenosis constricting e°erent arteriole to maintain GFR

ACE inhibitor renogram (continued) 
• After administration of an ACE inhibitor (typically captopril, 25–50 mg), the efferent 
arterioles will relax and GFR will decrease. If a patient is already on an ACE inhibitor, it should be stopped for 48 hours to 1 week prior to the exam. Intravenous access should be maintained in case fluid resuscitation is needed to treat hypotension. Known severe renal artery stenosis is a relative contraindication as ACE inhibitor-induced intrarenal 
hypotension can lead to acute renal failure. 
• An ACE renogram can be performed in one or two days. A single-day, two-stage protocol comprises a baseline non-captopril study using a low dose of MAG3, 
followed by a captopril study several hours later when residual activity from the first study has cleared the kidneys and urinary tract. A two-day protocol is usually used for patients without pre-existing renal dysfunction. The captopril study 
is performed first, which if normal, excludes renovascular hypertension and thus eliminates the need for a baseline study. If the captopril study is abnormal, a baseline study is performed on the following day. 
• A positive study depends on the radiotracer utilized (MAG3 or DTPA), but the hallmark is a post-ACE inhibitor renogram that becomes abnormal or more abnormal, usually unilaterally. 
MAG3 pre-captopril post-captopril 


MAG3 (tubular agent): Uptake and secretion are generally preserved even with a reduced GFR, but further 
. GFR results in . urine production and . washout of secreted agent from collecting system. Positive criteria for MAG3 study include: <40% uptake by one kidney at 2–3 minutes; difference in cortical 
activity by 20%; or delay in time to peak activity of more than 2 minutes (compared to pre-ACE inhibitor). DTPA (glomerular agent): Unlike MAG3, . GFR causes diminished uptake and excretion of DTPA. 
• Bilateral worsening renograms can be caused by hypotension, dehydration (most common), urinary obstruction, medical renal disease, or bilateral renal artery stenosis. 
Renal cortical imaging 
• 
Renal cortical imaging is limited to renal imaging in children to evaluate for pyelonephritis or scarring. The radiotracer is Tc-99m DMSA. 

• 
A normal DMSA study excludes the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. 

• 
A positive study for pyelonephritis can have three patterns: Focal cortical defect. Multifocal cortical defects. Diffusely decreased radiotracer. 



Radionuclide cystography (RNC) 
• 
Radionuclide cystography is the most sensitive test for evaluation of reflux in pediatric population with less radiation exposure compared to voiding cystourethrography (VCUG). 

• 
The radiotracer chosen is variable. Tc-99m pertechnetate, Tc-99m DTPA, and Tc-99m sulfur colloid can all work well. Regardless of the radiotracer chosen, it is injected retrograde into the catheterized bladder. 

• 
Grading of reflux: Minimal (RNC grade I): Reflux is confined to the ureter. Moderate (RNC grade II): Reflux extends superiorly to the pelvicalyceal system. Severe (RNC grade III): Severe reflux causing a tortuous ureter and/or dilated intrarenal system. 



Renal transplant evaluation 
• 
While transplanted kidneys are often initially evaluated by ultrasound and ultimately by biopsy, radionuclide renogram using Tc-99m MAG3 or DTPA is an important diagnostic tool. 

• 
A normal renal transplant should be visualized on the flow phase within seconds after the iliac vessels. Its cortical and clearance phases are similar to those of a native kidney. 

• 
Renogram findings of common transplant complications include: 


Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) occurs within 3–4 days after surgery and results from perioperative ischemia. Its renogram is characterized by normal perfusion, but poor renal function with increased cortical retention, delayed clearance and decreased urine excretion. 
Hyperacute rejection produces immediate vascular thrombosis in the transplanted kidney, resulting in absent perfusion, markedly reduced or absent function. 
Acute rejection occurs within weeks to three months after surgery. It presents as decreased perfusion and marked cortical retention. 
Chronic rejection occurs months to years after surgery. It is characterized by progressive worsening perfusion and function with cortical thinning, pelvicalyceal dilation. 
Cyclosporin nephrotoxicity appears similar to ATN, but occurs at a later time after ATN should have resolved. 
Urine leak presents as progressive accumulation of activity outside the urinary tract. 
Urinoma, hematoma and lymphocele may present as fixed perirenal photopenic areas.
