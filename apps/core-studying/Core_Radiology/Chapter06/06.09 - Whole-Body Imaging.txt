Whole-body imaging of neoplasm, infection, and inflammation 
Radiotracers 
I-123 MIBG 
• 
I-123 MIBG is a norepinephrine analog that is taken up by chromaffin cells of sympathetic adrenergic tissue. It is used to image pheochromocytoma in adults and neuroblastoma in children. To a lesser extent, MIBG is taken up by other neuroendocrine tumors including carcinoid, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and paraganglioma. 

• 
I-131 MIBG can be used to treat neuroblastoma in children. 

• 
Normal distribution is areas of sympathetic innervation, including salivary glands, heart, thyroid (although this is typically intentionally blocked with Lugol’s solution to reduce thyroid dosimetry), liver, kidney, and bladder. 


Indium-111 pentetreotide (Octreoscan) 
• 
Indium-111 is cyclotron-produced and decays by electron capture, emitting two gamma photons at 173 and 247 keV. Its half-life is 67 hours. Pentetreotide is octreotide conjugated to DTPA which allows binding to In-111. 

• 
In-111 pentetreotide is used to detect tumors with somatostatin receptors, including amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) tumors. Most common applications are evaluation of carcinoid or islet cell tumors such as gastrinoma. However, pentetreotide has low sensitivity for insulinoma. 

• 
Paragangliomas (extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas) are seen better with In-111 pentetreotide compared to MIBG, although In-111 pentetreotide is uncommonly used for detection of paragangliomas. 

• 
Normal distribution is intense renal and splenic uptake, with slightly less hepatic uptake. 


Indium-111 oxine leukocytes (WBCs) 
• 
The normal distribution of Indium-111 labeled WBCs is spleen > liver >> bone marrow. 

• 
Infection imaging with an In-111 WBC scan is performed at 24 hours. 

• 
The key advantage of In-111 oxine WBCs compared to gallium is the lack of physiologic bowel accumulation, which allows evaluation of abdominal or bowel infection/ inflammation. 

• 
Disadvantages compared to gallium include a tedious labeling procedure, higher radiation dose, and less accuracy in diagnosing spinal osteomyelitis. 

• 
Advantages of In-111 WBC scan compared to Tc-99m HMPAO include absence of interfering bowel and renal activity, ability to perform delayed imaging, and ability to perform simultaneous Tc-99m sulfur colloid or Tc-99m MDP bone scan. These combined approaches are very helpful for evaluation of osteomyelitis in the setting of a baseline abnormal bone scan (e.g., prosthesis evaluation), discussed below. 





Tc-99m HMPAO leukocytes (WBCs) 


• 
The advantages of a WBC scan labeled with Tc-99m HMPAO compared to In-111 are related to the shorter half-life of Tc-99m, which allows a higher administered activity, better counts, a lower absorbed dose, and ability to perform earlier imaging. For these reasons, Tc-99m is often preferred in children in appropriate cases. 

• 
However, a major disadvantage is physiologic uptake within the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts due to unbound Tc-99m HMPAO complexes, which limits bowel evaluation. Renal activity occurs early, while bowel activity is seen after 1–2 hours. Additionally, delayed imaging is less practical with Tc-99m due to its shorter half-life. 


Gallium-67 
• 
Gallium-67 is cyclotron-produced and decays by electron capture, with a half-life of 78 hours. It emits multiple gamma rays at 93, 184, 296, and 388 keV (easier to remember as 90, 190, 290, and 390 keV). Gallium binds to transferrin, which is found in infection, inflammation, and neoplasm. 

• 
Normal distribution includes the nasopharynx, lacrimal and salivary glands, liver, colon, and bone marrow. Use is limited in the abdomen due to high bowel and liver uptake. 

• 
Persistent gallium in the kidneys is never normal after 24 hours and signifies renal disease or obstruction. 

• 
Diffuse pulmonary uptake is also not normal, with a wide differential of infectious and inflammatory conditions: 


Pneumocystis pneumonia, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, miliary tuberculosis, and fungal infection. 

• The panda sign reflects increased uptake in the nasopharynx, parotid glands, and lacrimal glands due to inflammation, resembling the dark markings on a panda’s face. It is classically seen in sarcoidosis. 
The panda sign is not specific for sarcoidosis, although it strongly (5.25 mCi administered) suggests sarcoid when the . sign is also seen (due to bilateral hilar shows high uptake in the and right paratracheal adenopathy). Sarcoid is also the most common bowel and salivary glands, disorder to affect the salivary and lacrimal glands symmetrically. moderate uptake in the liver 
Differential diagnosis of the panda sign includes Sjögren syndrome, and bone marrow, and faint lymphoma after irradiation, and AIDS. uptake in the lungs. 
• Gallium scans have been largely replaced by F-18 FDG PET/CT. A residual first-line application of gallium scan is the evaluation of spinal discovertebral osteomyelitis. 


Thallium-201 
• 
Thallium-201 is cyclotron-produced, decays by electron capture, and produces relatively low-energy characteristic x-rays of 69–81 keV. Its half-life is 73 hours. Normal distribution is prominent uptake in the kidneys, heart, liver, thyroid, and bowel. 

• 
Thallium imaging is infrequently used due to its long half-life and resultant high radiation exposure. Historically, thallium has been used in combination with gallium scan to distinguish between Kaposi sarcoma, lymphoma, and tuberculosis in immunocompromised patients. Thallium was also historically used as a myocardial agent. 




Clinical applications 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
• Historically, increased focal gallium uptake in the liver suggests hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Conversely, HCC is extremely unlikely if gallium uptake is diminished. 
Combined gallium and thallium imaging 
• Kaposi sarcoma is thallium-avid, but does not take up gallium. Mnemonic: KaT (Kaposi is 
Thallium-avid). 

• 
Tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria take up gallium but not thallium. This is the opposite of Kaposi sarcoma. Mnemonic: TuG (Tuberculosis is Gallium-avid). 

• 
Lymphoma takes up both gallium and thallium. Mnemonic: Lymphoma likes both. 


Osteomyelitis 
• 
A positive triple-phase Tc-99m MDP bone scan is only specific for osteomyelitis if the radiograph is normal. If there is an underlying abnormality, SPECT/CT, gallium or WBC scan can increase specificity. 

• 
Gallium imaging can increase specificity of a positive bone scan, especially for vertebral osteomyelitis and discitis. 

• 
A WBC scan (typically with Indium-111) can increase specificity in evaluation of an infected orthopedic prosthesis, where scanning is typically performed in conjunction with Tc-99m sulfur colloid. When comparing the two scans (WBC and sulfur colloid), a discordant region with increased WBC tracer uptake and decreased sulfur colloid uptake is suggestive of marrow replacement by WBCs, consistent with osteomyelitis. Conversely, a region of normal marrow would be expected to demonstrate uptake both by WBCs and sulfur colloid. 


Adrenal pheochromocytoma 
• I-123 MIBG is generally considered the first-line agent for evaluation of adrenal pheochromocytoma. Indium-111 pentetreotide can be considered as a second-line agent if the MIBG scan is negative, though the normal renal uptake of pentetreotide may obscure an adrenal lesion. 

Extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma 
• 
The sensitivity of I-123 MIBG for detection of extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma (i.e., paraganglioma or glomus tumor) ranges from 63–100%, with potential loss of MIBG uptake seen in tumor cell dedifferentiation, altered membrane transport proteins, or interference by medications. Indium-111 pentetreotide is also an option. 

• 
The role of F-18 FDG PET in the evaluation of metastatic extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma is evolving. Most tumors are FDG-avid. 



Metastatic carcinoid/neuroendocrine tumor 


Metastatic carcinoid: Axial non-contrast CT shows a 
mesenteric mass containing 
coarse calcification (arrow) in the central lower abdomen, 
which has a typical appearance 
for carcinoid. 

Fused multiplanar SPECT (top row) from an indium-111 pentetreotide scan and CT (bottom row) correlate a focus of increased uptake in the lower abdomen with the calcified mesenteric mass on CT, confirming the diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumor/carcinoid. All other foci of tracer uptake seen on SPECT localized to bowel, representing physiologic bowel uptake. 
• 
Indium-111 pentetreotide (Octreoscan) was traditionally the tracer of choice for evaluation of carcinoid tumor (see below). SPECT/CT is almost always performed in conjuction with an Octreoscan. 

• 
The sensitivity for detecting neuroendocrine tumors is 82–95%; however, specificity is only around 50%, especially when a “hot spot” is found near a region of physiologic uptake in the pituitary, thyroid, liver, spleen, urinary tract, or bowel. False positives can also occur in benign processes such as inflammation, Graves disease, and sarcoidosis. These inflammatory false-positives are thought to be due to somatostatin receptors expressed in activated lymphocytes. 

• 
Octreoscan is being replaced by Gallium-68 DOTATATE PET/CT (discussed earlier in this chapter) for detection of neuroendocrine tumors with high somatostatin receptor expression, as PET/CT has higher spatial resolution than SPECT/CT and Gallium-68-DOTATATE has much higher affinity for somatostatin receptors than Indium-111 pentetreotide.
