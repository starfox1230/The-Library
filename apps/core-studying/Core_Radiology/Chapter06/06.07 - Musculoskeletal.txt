Radiotracers 
Tc-99m MDP or HDP 
• 
Tc-99m MDP and HDP are technetium-labeled diphosphonates which deposit via chemisorption in the mineral phase of bone. 20 mCi is typically administered, with imaging performed 2–4 hours later. 

• 
Rapid renal excretion is normal; bladder is the critical organ. Patients should void before imaging to prevent the bladder from obscuring a pelvic lesion. 

• 
A three-phase study incudes: 


1) Radionuclide angiogram (flow) evaluates blood flow, with images taken every few seconds. Increased flow suggests hyperemia. 
2) Blood pool evaluates the extracellular distribution immediately following the blood flow phase. 
3) Standard delayed (skeletal) images are performed approximately 3 hours after injection. 



Common patterns and clinical applications 
Patterns with low probability of metastatic disease (in a patient with a known malignancy) 
• 
A single focus of uptake in a rib is thought to represent malignancy only ~10% of the time. 

• 
Uptake in similar locations in two or more adjacent ribs is almost always due to trauma. 

• 
Multiple adjacent photopenic bony lesions are unlikely to be metastases, but may represent infarction, avascular necrosis, or sequela of radiation therapy. 



Patterns with high probability of metastatic disease 
• 
A single sternal lesion in a patient with breast cancer is due to metastasis ~80% of the time. 

• 
Multifocal areas of increased activity in nonadjacent ribs are suspicious for metastases. 

• 
A single photopenic lesion in patients with a known malignancy (especially neuroblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, and thyroid cancer) is due to metastasis 80% of the time. 

• 
Beware of the flare phenomenon within three months of starting chemotherapy, where treated bone metastases demonstrate increased uptake due to healing. Tracer uptake should regress by 6 months following treatment. 



Cancers likely to produce a false-negative bone scan 
• 
While bone scan is highly sensitive for osseous metastases that induce bone turnover or are predominantly osteoblastic, such as prostate cancer, it has low sensitivity for predominantly osteoclastic or lytic metastases. These tumors include multiple myeloma, renal cell carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, aggressive anaplastic tumors, and neuroblastoma. 

• 
Marrow-replacing tumors such as lymphoma can also produce negative bone scans. 

• 
Aggressive and lytic bony lesions or those confined to the marrow are better seen on F-18 FDG PET/CT. 

• 
Diffuse soft tissue uptake can be seen in renal failure. 

• 
Increased uptake in the brain, heart, or spleen may be due to recent infarction. 

• 
Malignant pleural effusion or ascites can cause increased uptake. 

• 
Soft-tissue metastases containing calcium can have increased uptake, including osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, or mucin-producing tumors (gastrointestinal and ovarian). 

• 
Soft tissue uptake associated with dystrophic calcifications can be seen after trauma or in inflammatory diseases such as myositis ossificans, dermatomyositis, or rhabdomyolysis. 

• 
In the breasts, faint uptake can be normal, but focal intense uptake suggests breast carcinoma. Tracer uptake can be seen at site of recent breast procedure (e.g., biopsy). 

• 
Diffuse parenchymal uptake in kidneys can be seen with urinary obstruction, hyperparathyroidism, chemotherapy, or thalassemia. 


Superscan 

Superscan: Anterior and posterior whole body bone scan at two different windowing levels after 21 mCi Tc­99m MDP administered shows diffusely increased skeletal uptake in the axial skeleton and proximal femurs. There are scattered foci of uptake in the calvarium. No renal uptake is seen. 

Sagittal CT in the same patient shows diffuse sclerotic appearance of the entire skeleton. This patient had metastatic prostate carcinoma. 
•A 
superscan represents diffusely increased osseous uptake. Sometimes the uptake can be so diffuse that it may look normal on first glance. The clue to the presence of a superscan will be nonvisualization (or very faint visualization) of the kidneys. 

• 
A superscan is most commonly due to metastatic prostate cancer. Other malignancies producing a superscan include breast cancer and lymphoma. 

• 
A superscan can also be caused by metabolic bone disease in hyperparathyroidism and renal osteodystrophy. If the cause for the superscan is metabolic, then the entire long bones tend to demonstrate diffusely increased uptake. In contrast, with metastatic disease the axial skeleton and proximal humeri and femora are primarily affected. 


Primary bone tumors 
• 
Osteosarcoma typically causes markedly increased uptake, often with increased uptake in the entire affected limb. 

• 
Ewing sarcoma features intense and homogeneous activity. It may be positive on all three phases of a three-phase bone scan, mimicking osteomyelitis. 

• 
Benign bone tumors that have intense uptake include osteoid osteoma, osteoblastoma, fibrous dysplasia, giant cell tumor, and aneurysmal bone cyst. 

• 
Osteoid osteoma features a vascular central nidus which demonstrates intense activity. The double density sign describes an intense focus of uptake corresponding to the nidus, surrounded by relatively increased uptake representing hyperemia. The differential of the double density sign includes osteoid osteoma, Brodie abscess, less likely stress fracture.

Fracture 
• 
An acute fracture (from the initial injury up to 3–4 weeks) will show increased radiotracer uptake surrounding the fracture site. 95% of fractures are positive after one day in patients under 65 years old. Note that skull fractures rarely show activity. 

• 
In the subacute phase (until two to three months) radiotracer activity becomes more focal at the fracture. 

• 
In the healing phase (variable time course, with ~40% remaining abnormal after one year) there is a gradual decrease in radiotracer activity. 

• 
Toddler’s fracture represents a spiral fracture of the tibia and occurs in recently ambulatory children. Skeletal scintigraphy is sensitive and specific, and routinely used in workup of a limping child if the radiographs are negative. 

• 
A stress fracture represents a fracture due to abnormal stress in a normal bone. 

• 
Common sites of stress fractures include the tibial diaphysis, the femoral neck, and the metatarsals. Metatarsal stress fractures are the most common stress injury in the foot/ ankle, with 90% occurring in the second or third metatarsals. 

• 
The bone scan is typically positive by the time the patient has pain. A stress fracture is positive on all three phases of the bone scan.

Insufficiency fracture 
• 
An insufficiency fracture represents a fracture in response to normal stress in an abnormal bone due to underlying osteoporosis. 

• 
A sacral insufficiency fracture typically shows “H”-shaped uptake in the sacrum, often referred to as the Honda sign. 

• 
Insufficiency fracture of the knee is a cause of atraumatic knee pain in the elderly. It typically appears as intense uptake in the medial femoral condyle. This condition was previously called spontaneous osteonecrosis of the knee (SONK) but has seen been discredited as it is insufficiency rather than osteonecrosis. 



Anterior and posterior projections from a Tc-99m MDP bone scan (25 mCi administered) show uptake in the sacrum with a H-shaped configuration, representing the Honda sign of sacral insufficiency fracture. 

Prosthesis evaluation 
• 
Evaluation of a painful hip or knee prosthesis for loosening or infection is a common indication for a bone scan. 

• 
In a cemented prosthesis, it is normal to see activity surrounding the prosthesis up to 12 months. In a non-cemented prosthesis, activity may remain increased up to two years as bony ingrowth continues. 

• 
In evaluation of a hip prosthesis, focal activity at the lesser trochanter (which acts as a fulcrum site) and distal femoral prosthetic tip seen >1 year for cemented or >2 years for non-cemented prosthesis suggests loosening. In contrast, generalized increase in radiotracer activity surrounding the prosthesis may suggest osteomyelitis. 

• 
Mild to moderate activity that is limited to the greater trochanter/intertrochanteric region is often due to heterotopic ossification. 

• 
Osteomyelitis is positive on all three phases of a bone scan. A positive three-phase bone scan is very specific for osteomyelitis in the presence of a normal radiograph (confirming that no fracture is present). 

• 
To evaluate for osteomyelitis in the presence of an underlying abnormality, such as a fracture or prosthesis, WBC imaging (indium-111 or Tc-99m labeled WBCs) combined with a Tc-99m sulfur colloid marrow scan can increase specificity for osteomyelitis. Focal WBC activity in a region devoid of colloid marrow activity is suggestive of osteomyelitis. 

• 
Although rarely performed, gallium-67 scan can also increase specificity for osteomyelitis if the gallium uptake exceeds the bone scan uptake in the area of concern. 

• 
Cellulitis shows increased MDP activity during the blood flow and soft tissue phases, but the skeletal phase is negative. 

• 
Septic arthritis is positive on all three phases of the bone scan on both sides of the joint. 

• 
Discitis shows increased skeletal activity in two adjacent vertebral bodies.

Focal increased uptake (arrows) is present at 
the left great toe on blood flow, blood pool, and delayed phases, suggesting osteomyelitis. 

Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy 
• 
Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy is long bone diaphyseal periosteal reaction most commonly due to pulmonary disease, such as lung cancer. 

• 
Bone scan shows increased parallel lines of activity along the cortex of long bones. 


Avascular necrosis (AVN) 
• 
Avascular necrosis (AVN) initially shows decreased radiotracer activity in the affected region, followed by a hyperemic phase with increased uptake. 

• 
SPECT imaging of AVN (especially of the hips) will often show a rim of increased uptake with central photopenia, thought to represent revascularization progressing from outside in. 



Paget disease: Anterior (left image) and posterior projections from a Tc-99m MDP bone scan (20 mCi administered) show 
heterogeneously increased radiotracer uptake involving the 
right humerus, and to a lesser extent the left hemipelvis, best seen on the posterior projection (arrows). 


• 
Paget disease is an idiopathic disturbance of osteoclastic and osteoblastic regulation. Paget has three discrete phases including lytic, mixed, and sclerotic phases. The lytic (early) phase is typically positive on bone scan and often negative on radiography. The mixed phase is abnormal on bone scan and radiography. The sclerotic phase shows persistent radiographic changes, but the bone scan activity may subside. 

• 
One complication of Paget disease is malignant degeneration to osteosarcoma. A focal cold lesion should raise concern for necrosis in a region of malignant degeneration, although this may be best appreciated by evaluating serial studies. 


Complex regional pain syndrome (reflex sympathetic dystrophy) 
• 
Complex regional pain syndrome, previously called reflex sympathetic dystrophy, causes persistent pain, tenderness, and swelling often due to minor trauma. 

• 
Bone scan shows diffusely increased juxta-articular activity in multiple small joints of the hand or foot on delayed (skeletal) images. Blood pool and soft tissue phase uptake is variable, but most commonly both phases are increased.
