• 
On imaging, a clue to the presence of a pericardial defect is a lucent notch between the aorta and pulmonary artery (sometimes seen on radiography, but generally better appreciated on CT), which represents interposed lung between these vascular structures. 

• 
Defects of the left pericardium cause leftward displacement of the heart, which may in some cases be the only imaging finding. 


Pericardial masses 
• 
Pericardial cysts can be congenital or a sequela of prior cardiac surgery. 70% of pericardial cysts occur in the right cardiophrenic angle, 20% occur in the left cardiophrenic angle. It can be difficult to differentiate a pericardial cyst from a thymic or bronchogenic cyst. 

• 
Pericardial diverticula communicate with the pericardial space and can change in size. 

• 
The most common primary pericardial tumor is pericardial mesothelioma. 

• 
Most common pericardial metastases are from lung and breast cancer.

• 
The most common cardiac mass is a thrombus. 

• 
Metastases to the heart or pericardium are far more common than primary cardiac tumors. This can occur from direct extension of intrathoracic malignancy (breast or lung), direct extension through SVC or IVC (e.g., renal cell carcinoma via the IVC), or hematogenous spread (e.g., melanoma, lymphoma). 

• 
The majority, approximately 75%, of primary cardiac tumors are benign. 

• 
Common childhood cardiac masses are discussed in the “Pediatric” chapter. 




Benign primary cardiac tumors 
Thrombus 

Thrombus: Axial MR images show a pedunculated mass in the right atrium attached to the inter-atrial septum (arrows), which is mildly T2 hyperintense (right image), T1 isointense relative to myocardium (not shown), and demonstrates no gadolinium enhancement (left image). 
• 
Intracardiac thrombus can mimic a cardiac tumor. 

• 
Distinguishing imaging features are lack of contrast enhancement in the thrombus and adjacent myocardial scar and/or akinetic cardiac wall.  


Myxoma 

Left atrial myxoma: Axial CTA image (left image) shows a left atrial mass attached to the inter-atrial septum (arrow). Axial MR images show the T2 hyperintense mass (arrow, middle image) and demonstrates heterogeneous late gadolinium enhancement (arrow, right image). 
• 
Myxoma is the most common benign primary cardiac tumor in adults. 

• 
75% of cardiac myxomas arise in the left atrium, usually attached to the inter-atrial septum in region of the fossa ovalis. 20% arise in the right atrium. The tumor may prolapse through a valve or patent foramen ovale. 

• 
On MRI, myxomas have similar T1 signal to myocardium, are T2 hyperintense, demonstrate little to no enhancement on first pass perfusion, and heterogeneous low-level LGE. Calcification and hemosiderin deposition from intralesional hemorrhage are common. 

• 
Lipomas are common benign cardiac tumors that have a spherical shape and well-circumscribed margin, typically located in the right atrium, arise from the endocardial surface and project into the atrial cavity. They follow fat signal intensity on all MRI sequences and do not enhance. 



Lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum: Axial and coronal noncontrast CT demonstrates a focal area of fat attenuation at the inter-atrial septum, along the right heart border (arrows).

• 
Lipomatous hypertrophy of the inter-atrial septum (LHIS) represents proliferation of fatty deposits within the inter-atrial septum, typically along the lateral right heart border. The fossa ovalis is spared, resulting in a dumbbell configuration of the fatty tissue. 

• 
LHIS is an incidental finding that does not require treatment. It is important to not mistake it for a cardiac mass. Unlike lipomas, LHIS does not have a capsule on histopathology. 

• 
An exceedingly rare differential consideration of a fatty cardiac mass is liposarcoma. 


Papillary fibroelastoma 

Multiplanar reformatted CTA images at level of the aortic valve show a trileaflet aortic valve and a round pedunculated lesion attached to the noncoronary cusp thought to represent a papillary fibroelastoma (arrows). Surgical resection confirmed the diagnosis. 
• 
Papillary fibroelastoma is the most common tumor of the cardiac valves. 

• 
The most common location is the aortic valve on the side of the aorta. 

• 
On MRI, papillary fibroelastomas have low T2 signal due to high fibrous content. 

• 
While these tumors are usually small in size, they may promote thrombus formation, detach and embolize, or affect valvular function. 


Hemangioma 
• 
Hemangiomas can occur in any cardiac chamber and involve the pericardium. 

• 
Similar to elsewhere in the body, hemangiomas are hyperintense on T2, intensely enhancing due to rich vascularity, with possible flow voids and calcifications. 


Cardiac: 536 
• 
Cardiac paragangliomas are usually benign, however, these tumors can have malignant potential. “Malignancy” is defined by WHO when there is distant metastasis. Common locations include in and around the left atrium, retroaortic, and aorticopulmonary window. 

• 
Imaging features are identical to paragangliomas/pheochromocytomas elsewhere in body, including hyperenhancement due to high vascularity and T2 hyperintense signal relative to myocardium. 



Biopsy-proven paraganglioma: Axial CTA and T2-weighted MR images show a large mass centered at the right atrium, which invades the right atrial wall, obliterates the adjacent epicardial fat, and extends into the left atrium. The mass demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement (left image) and T2 hyperintense signal (right image). 

Malignant primary cardiac tumors 
• 
Sarcomas represent the most common type of malignant primary cardiac tumors, followed by primary cardiac lymphoma which is rare compared to secondary lymphoma involving the heart. 

• 
Common imaging features of malignant cardiac tumors include involvement of more than 


one cardiac chamber, intralesional necrosis, invasion of the pericardium and epicardial fat, extension to extracardiac structures, hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, and metastases. 
• 
Primary cardiac sarcomas in adults include osteosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, liposarcoma, intimal (spindle cell) and undifferentiated sarcoma. 

• 
Intimal sarcoma is a relatively new WHO classification and refers to sarcomas of the aorta and pulmonary artery/vein that express the MDM2 gene. 

• 
Apart from intimal sarcoma, the other sarcomas listed above have a predilection for the left atrium, unlike angiosarcoma. 


Angiosarcoma 
• 
Angiosarcoma is the most common primary cardiac malignancy in adults. 

• 
Right side of the heart is typically affected, most often the right atrium. 

• 
On MRI, angiosarcoma may have a “cauliflower-like” heterogeneous appearance with intralesional hemorrhage, necrosis, and T1 and T2 hypointense foci which represent vascular channels. 




Axial pre- and post-contrast SSFP MR images (top) show a lobulated enhancing mass (yellow arrows) originating from the right atrial free wall, which involves the tricuspid valve (red arrow) and invades the epicardial fat (blue arrow). 
PET-CT image (bottom left) shows intense FDG uptake within the mass. 
This was a biopsy-proven angiosarcoma.
