Nuclear cardiology 
Myocardial perfusion and viability imaging 
Perfusion imaging overview 
• 
Radionuclide perfusion imaging evaluates the blood flow to the left ventricular myocardium. Decreased regional myocardial perfusion can result from reduced blood flow due to hemodynamically significant obstructive coronary artery disease (stress) or lack of viable cells due to myocardial infarction (rest). 

• 
Each perfusion test has two components: An element of stress, and a method of imaging. 

• 
The stress component can be physical (treadmill), pharmacologic-vasodilatory (dipyridamole, adenosine, or regadenoson) or pharmacologic-adrenergic (dobutamine). 

• 
Radionuclide perfusion imaging can be performed with SPECT (Tc-99m sestamibi, Tc-99m tetrofosmin, thallium-201) or PET radiotracers (rubidium-82, N-13 ammonia). ECG-gated imaging is standard for cardiac SPECT (GSPECT) and PET. 


Other types of stress tests performed by cardiologists (ECG stress tests and echocardiographic or MRI stress tests) can be performed in lieu of radionuclide imaging. These non-imaging tests can detect other signs of perfusion abnormalities, such as ischemic ECG changes or wall motion abnormalities. 
Viability imaging overview 
• 
Prior to a revascularization procedure (e.g., coronary artery bypass surgery, CABG or coronary angioplasty/stenting), it is important to know if the hypoperfused myocardium is viable, as the revascularization of scar tissue would not provide a clinical benefit. 

• 
Viability imaging can be performed with rest-redistribution thallium-201 perfusion imaging or F-18 FDG PET metabolic imaging. F-18 FDG PET evaluation of glucose metabolism is the gold standard for evaluation of myocardial viability, although unlike thallium FDG-PET does not evaluate perfusion. 


Clinical applications of myocardial perfusion and viability imaging 
• Evaluation of acute chest pain. Myocardial perfusion imaging is often the gatekeeper to further cardiac workup in patients where there is clinical ambiguity for cardiac ischemia (e.g., chest pain with negative ECG and troponins). A negative myocardial perfusion exam allows safe discharge. 
A normal myocardial perfusion exam is associated with a 0.6% annual rate of a cardiac event, even among patients with a high pre-test likelihood of coronary artery disease. 
• 
Evaluation of hemodynamic significance of coronary stenosis. Even with a coronary artery stenosis seen on invasive or CT angiography, patients with a normal nuclear cardiac perfusion exam have a relatively low risk for cardiac events. 

• 
Risk stratification after MI. Findings that would classify a patient as high risk include: 


Large and severe perfusion defects. Significant stress-induced or peri-infarct ischemia. Defect in multiple vascular territories (suggesting multi-vessel disease). Significant lung uptake, 
suggesting left ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular aneurysm. Low ejection fraction (less than 40% seen) on gated imaging. 
Ejection fraction (EF) is calculated as EF = (EDC – ESC)/(EDC) EDC = end diastolic counts; ESC = end systolic counts 
Clinical applications of myocardial perfusion and viability imaging (continued) 
• 
Preoperative risk assessment for intermediate to high risk noncardiac surgery. 

• 
Evaluation of viability prior to coronary revascularization therapy. 

• 
Evaluation of myocardial revascularization status post CABG in symptomatic patients or after 5 years. 



Radionuclides 
Thallium-201 
• Thallium-201 is a cyclotron-produced radionuclide with a half-life of 73 hours. It decays by 
electron capture and emits characteristic X-rays of 69–81 keV. 
Relatively low energy characteristic X-rays increase attenuation artifact from chest wall soft tissues. 
It is necessary to administer fairly low doses due to its long half-life, with resultant lower count densities 
which requires longer imaging acquisition times. 
• 
Physiologically, thallium acts like a potassium analog, crossing into the cell via active transport through the ATP-dependent sodium-potassium transmembrane pump. 

• 
Myocardial uptake is directly proportional to myocardial perfusion. 

• 
A 50% stenosis will generally produce a perfusion defect upon maximal exercise. 

• 
Thallium undergoes redistribution with simultaneous cellular washout and re-extraction of blood-pool radiotracer. Only viable myocardium can extract thallium. Therefore, ischemic but viable myocardium will show perfusion defect during stress due to decreased blood flow, but normalization of defect on post-redistribution images. In contrast, an infarct or scar will show a persistent defect. 


Technetium-99m sestamibi and tetrofosmin 
• 
Technetium-99m is generator-produced, therefore more readily available. Its shorter half-life (6 hours) and higher photon energy (140 keV) allow for larger administered dose at lower radiation dose to the patient, superior image quality, shorter acquisition time, and less attenuation artifact from adjacent soft tissues. For these reasons, Tc-99m labeled radiotracers are more widely used than thallium in myocardial perfusion imaging. 

• 
Unlike thallium, Tc-99m sestamibi (Cardiolite) does not undergo redistribution and remains fixed in the myocardium. 

• 
Sestamibi enters myocardium via passive diffusion and binds to mitochondrial membrane proteins. Similar to thallium, myocardial uptake of sestamibi is proportional to myocardial perfusion. 

• 
Tc-99m tetrofosmin (Myoview) is similar to sestamibi but has the advantage of faster hepatobiliary clearance, which allows earlier imaging (since adjacent liver activity may interfere with cardiac imaging). 


Rubidium-82 
• 
Rubidium-82 is a positron-emitting PET perfusion agent that is generated from strontium-82. A very short half-life of 76 seconds allows high doses to be administered, however such a short half-life precludes the use of exercise stress. Pharmacologic stress is used instead. 

• 
Rubidium-82 acts as a potassium analog, similar to thallium. 


Nitrogen-13 ammonia 
• Nitrogen-13 ammonia is a positron-emitting PET perfusion agent (like rubidium-82) that has a half-life of 10 minutes. Unlike rubidium-82, N-13 is cyclotron-produced and the cyclotron must be on-site due to its short half-life. 
Nitrogen-13 ammonia (continued) 
• 
N-13 has excellent imaging characteristics. N-13 positrons have a low kinetic energy and do not travel very far in the tissue before annihilating, which allows relatively high resolution. The short half-life also allows large doses to be given for high counts. 

• 
Like rubidium-82, N-13 perfusion is almost always coupled with a pharmacologic stress. Exercise stress is possible with N-13 ammonia but can be logistically challenging due to the 10-minute half-life, as it has to be coordinated with the cyclotron delivery of the radiotracer. 


Fluorine-18 FDG 
• 
Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18 FDG), the same radiotracer used for oncologic imaging, is a positron emitting PET viability agent with a half-life of 110 minutes. Unlike rubidium-82 and N-13 ammonia, FDG cannot be used for perfusion. 

• 
Viable myocardium uptakes FDG; scar does not. 



Types of stress – exercise and pharmacologic 
• The stress component of a cardiac perfusion study can be physical or pharmacologic. 
General exercise protocol 
• 
Prior to undergoing a myocardial perfusion study with exercise stress, the patient should be NPO for 6 hours. In patients without known coronary artery disease, calcium channel blockers and ß-blockers should be held to allow patient to reach target heart rate. Long-acting nitrates may mask ischemia and should also be held when possible. 

• 
Exercise is performed with a multistage treadmill (Bruce or modified Bruce) protocol. The target heart rate, which is calculated as 85% of maximal heart rate must be achieved for the study to be diagnostic. The maximal calculated heart rate is 220 bpm minus age. 

• 
Other parameters used to assess the adequacy of exercise stress include the product of peak heart rate and peak systolic blood pressure, metabolic equivalents (METs), and exercise time. 

• 
Contraindications for exercise stress include acute myocardial infarction (within 48 hours), high risk unstable angina, sustained or hemodynamically significant ventricular tachyarrhythmia, acute aortic dissection, acute pulmonary embolism, acute pericarditis, severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, decompensated heart failure, or inability to exercise. 

• 
Pharmacologic stress is an alternative in patients who cannot exercise physically or in those with left bundle branch block, which can cause false positive reversible septal perfusion defects with exercise. 


Dipyridamole stress – pharmacologic vasodilator 
• 
Dipyridamole is an adenosine deaminase inhibitor that allows endogenous adenosine to accumulate. Adenosine is a potent vasodilator, increasing coronary blood flow by 3–5 times. 

• 
The microcirculation fed by a critical coronary artery stenosis cannot further dilate in response to adenosine. That coronary artery territory will appear as a relative perfusion defect on stress imaging. 

• 
Unlike a physical stress, a dipyridamole stress does not increase cardiac work or O2 demand. 

• 
Caffeine and theophylline competitively inhibit vasodilation from dipyridamole and must be held for at least 12 hours. 

• 
Side effects of dipyridamole include nausea, dizziness, headache, flushing, and chest pain, wheezing, and rarely heart block. The antidote is aminophylline (100–200 mg), which has a shorter half-life than dipyridamole, so patients with wheezing or heart block from dipyridamole must be warned that symptoms may rarely reappear after several hours. 


Adenosine stress – pharmacologic vasodilator 
• Adenosine has identical physiologic effects as dipyridamole but a more rapid effect. It may also frequently cause atrioventricular block that is resolved most of the time by physical exercise (hand grip or moving the legs or walking on a treadmill during infusion). Wheezing is also seen, especially in patients with asthma. Because adenosine has an extremely short half-life (<10 seconds), a reversal agent is usually not required. 
Regadenoson – pharmacologic vasodilator 
• Regadenoson is a selective A2A (adenosine) receptor agonist with a 2–3 minute half-life. It is easier to administer than adenosine with a convenient non-weight based fixed-dose intravenous injection over 10 seconds. Its effects can be reversed with aminophylline. 
Dobutamine stress – pharmacologic stress 
• 
Dobutamine is a ß1 agonist that increases myocardial oxygen demand. Dobutamine is used when vasodilator is contraindicated (severe asthma, COPD, or recent caffeine). 

• 
Contraindications are the same as for exercise stress testing (see above). 



Imaging protocols 
Single-day Tc-99m sestamibi/tetrofosmin perfusion SPECT 
• 
Tc-99m sestamibi or tetrofosmin perfusion SPECT is most commonly performed as a single-day study. Rest images are first obtained after intravenous injection of 8–10 mCi Tc-99m radiotracer. After background activity has cleared in 1–4 hours, stress images are obtained with an additional 25–30 mCi (three times rest dose) administered during peak exercise, or following pharmacologic stress. 

• 
Imaging is performed 45–90 minutes post-injection for resting studies, and at 30 minutes for exercise stress because of faster liver activity clearance. Since there is no redistribution, imaging can be delayed after tracer administration. 

• 
Gated SPECT images show wall motion at time of imaging, while perfusion images show perfusion at time of injection. Therefore, severely ischemic territories may sometimes not show evidence of regional wall motion abnormalities. If wall motion is abnormal in an ischemia territory, this typically indicates myocardial stunning, a highly specific feature for significant obstructive coronary artery disease. 


Two-day Tc-99m sestamibi/tetrofosmin perfusion SPECT 
• 
By performing the stress and rest studies on separate days, maximum dose (25–30 mCi) of radiotracer can be administered for optimal image quality, and interference by residual activity from the first study is minimized. This protocol is usually used in obese patients. 

• 
Also, if the stress study is performed first and is normal, the rest study can be safely  omitted. This is currently the preferred protocol due to shorter test duration and lower radiation dose. 


Thallium stress-redistribution (rest) SPECT 
• 
Because thallium undergoes redistribution, imaging is performed immediately (within 10–15 minutes) post-exercise and approximately 3–4 hours later once redistribution has occurred. Both sets of images can be obtained after a single injection of 3 mCi thallium, or two separate injections with 2 mCi administered at peak exercise for the stress images, and an additional 1 mCi administered before the second image set to ensure adequate thallium is available for redistribution. 

• 
Thallium is not often used for myocardial perfusion imaging because of its long 73-hour half-life and high radiation dose. However, it is used for viability imaging at sites without access to a PET scanner. 


Thallium rest-redistribution (rest) SPECT 
• For evaluation of myocardial viability prior to revascularization therapy, a rest-rest or rest-redistribution thallium study can be helpful. Following thallium injection at rest, images are obtained at 15 minutes and 3–4 hours later. Uptake on the delayed (redistribution) images indicates viable myocardium. 
PET perfusion 
• 
PET rest-stress myocardial perfusion has greater sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for diagnosis of coronary artery disease compared to SPECT imaging. 

• 
Rubidium-82 and N-13 ammonia are perfusion agents and are imaged on a PET system using coincidence detection. The shorter half-life of these tracers allows higher activities to be administered with lower overall radiation exposure. For quantification of myocardial blood flow, both rubidium-82 and N-13 ammonia have been validated. 


PET myocardial viability (glucose metabolism) 
• 
F-18 FDG PET is preferred over thallium for evaluation of myocardial viability. 

• 
To induce metabolism of glucose over fatty acids by the myocardium, patient is loaded with oral or IV glucose after a 6-hour fast, which triggers endogenous insulin production that in turn encourages glucose uptake and decreases fatty acid levels. 

• 
FDG uptake is seen in both normal myocardium and ischemic but viable myocardium. 


SPECT/CT and PET/CT 
• Attenuation-correction CT improves diagnostic accuracy by eliminating attenuation artifact and can be used for coronary artery calcium scoring. 

Image interpretation 
Key to successful perfusion imaging interpretation is a systematic approach: 
• Quality control: Is it a good study? 
For instance, in a single-day rest-stress study, the stress images should have higher signal to noise compared to the rest images since 3x more radiotracer was administered. If not, consider dose infiltration. 
• 
Is there misregistration between the stress and rest images, or between the SPECT and CT images? The attenuation-corrected and uncorrected images should be compared for potential artifacts. 

• 
The coronal/rotating raw SPECT images can show important ancillary findings: 


Is there motion artifact?  
Gated stress prone  Sinogram  Stress Tc-99m sestamibi rotating projection (representative image shown on left) and sinogram with patient in the supine position (top row) demonstrate motion, as indicated by horizontal breaks in the  




sinogram (arrows). 
Prone position stress sinogram (bottom row) shows no motion artifact.  
Is there attenuation artifact from the breast, diaphragm, or chest wall? Attenuation artifacts have normal wall motion on gated SPECT cine. A true fixed defect (infarct or scar) is hypokinetic or akinetic. 
Is there abnormal extracardiac uptake? Focal intense uptake in the breast or lung may signify cancer. 
Is there pulmonary uptake on exercise thallium-201 or Tc-99m sestamibi/tetrofosmin scan? Abnormally increased lung-to-heart activity ratio indicates stress-induced left ventricular dysfunction, usually from left main or multivessel coronary artery disease. 
Pulmonary uptake of Tc-99m 
sestamibi: 
Planar rotating projection images demonstrate increased lung uptake on exercise Tc-99m sestamibi scan with a lung to heart ratio of 0.62. 
SPECT rest and exercise perfusion images demonstrated multivessel ischemia (not shown). 

• Evaluation of the rest and stress SPECT or PET perfusion images is the core of the exam, with the key question: Is there a perfusion defect on the stress images? If a perfusion abnormality is present, the following additional questions help to characterize it: 
Is the defect reversible on rest images? A reversible defect signifies ischemia, while a fixed defect may 
represent either infarct/scar or hibernating myocardium. How large is the defect (number of myocardial segments, described on the next page)? Small (1–2 segments); medium (3–4 segments); large (5 or more segments). 
How severe is it? Mild (subendocardial), moderate, or severe (transmural)? Where is it? In which coronary artery territory? Is there dilation of the left ventricle during stress (transient ischemic dilation, TID)? If so, implies left main 
or three vessel disease and worse prognosis, even when there is no focal defect. Is there right ventricular uptake? If so, implies right heart disease or pulmonary hypertension. Is there exercise-induced reversible septal defect, not following a coronary artery territory? This occurs 
with LBBB in the absence of coronary artery disease and is not seen with pharmacologic stress. 
In summary, an example interpretation may be: There is a medium-sized perfusion defect of severe intensity involving the mid and basal inferior walls and the basal inferoseptal wall that was fixed. These findings suggest myocardial scar in the typical distribution of the RCA. 
• Gated SPECT (GSPECT) uses ECG gating of a standard myocardial perfusion SPECT acquisition for the quantitative assessment of the LV function. GSPECT allows for evaluation of LV perfusion at the same time as left ventricular wall motion, wall thickening, and ejection fraction (LVEF). It is not used to evaluate right ventricular function. 
Assessment of myocardial viability 
• Static SPECT images from a pure perfusion exam cannot distinguish between scar or hibernating myocardium. Both of these entities appear as a fixed (present on both stress and rest) perfusion defect. 
Myocardial scar is fibrosis resulting from prior myocardial necrosis (infarction). Hibernating myocardium describes viable but hypoperfused myocardium due to severe chronic ischemia, which may benefit from revascularization (either CABG or percutaneous intervention). 
• 
Functional data from GSPECT can distinguish attenuation artifacts from true perfusion defects; but GSPECT cannot distinguish hibernating myocardium from scar. Normal or nearly normal wall motion and wall thickening in the area of the perfusion defect suggests attenuation artifact, while a fixed defect with abnormal wall motion suggests scar or hibernating myocardium. FDG PET or thallium redistribution imaging is necessary to distinguish hibernating myocardium from scar. 

• 
F-18 FDG PET is the gold standard for evaluating myocardial viability and hibernation. 

• 
Normal myocardium preferentially metabolizes fatty acids during the fasting state. In contrast, ischemic but viable myocardium has a diminished ability to metabolize fatty acids and must depend on anaerobic metabolism of glucose for energy expenditure. Therefore, ischemic myocardium shows increased uptake on FDG PET. Myocardial scar does not take up FDG. 

• 
If the region of perfusion defect takes up FDG (a “mismatch” between FDG PET and perfusion imaging), it is viable (hibernating myocardium). In contrast, a “matched” perfusion /metabolic defect on perfusion imaging and FDG PET is consistent with non-viable scar. 

• 
Uptake of thallium-201 on delayed images due to redistribution also reflects viability. Rest-redistribution thallium SPECT is inferior to FDG PET because it may underestimate the presence of viable myocardium. 

• 
When myocardium has delayed recovery of contractile function despite reperfusion after a transient ischemic insult, it is termed stunned myocardium. Normal uptake on perfusion scan indicates viable cells, but the affected myocardium is akinetic or hypokinetic. Unlike hibernating myocardium which results from chronic ischemia, myocardial stunning is an acute, temporary process. Contractility will improve over time.

Normal  Normal  Normal  Normal  None  Normal  
Ischemia  Decreased  Normal  Increased  Yes  Normal/Decreased from stunning  
Infarct/Scar  Decreased  Decreased (fixed defect)  Decreased (matched)  No (fixed defect)  Decreased  
Hibernating myocardium  Decreased  Decreased (fixed defect)  Increased (mismatch)  Yes  Decreased  
Stunned myocardium  Normal/Near normal  Normal  Normal  Yes  Decreased  

Reconstruction axes and vascular territories 

• The heart is reconstructed into short axis (SA, the traditional “donut” view from apex of heart through the base), vertical long axis (VLA, a “U-shaped” view pointing to the left), and the horizontal long axis (HLA, a “U-shaped” view pointing down). The polar plot represents the entire three-dimensional left ventricle unfolded onto a two-dimensional map.

There is a moderate-sized fixed defect involving the mid and basal inferior wall (arrows), in the right coronary artery distribution. This represents either diaphragmatic attenuation, scar or hibernating myocardium. 
Normal wall motion and wall thickening indicated this is attenuation artifact. If contractility is abnormal, it could represent hibernating myocardium or scar.

There is a large-sized perfusion defect of severe intensity involving the apical, mid, and basal segments of the anterior (LAD territory, yellow arrows) and lateral (left circumflex territory, red arrows) walls that was partially reversible.

Subsequent rubidium-82 stress PET scan (right column) demonstrates normal stress perfusion, confirming the SPECT defect as an artifact from breast tissue attenuation. 



Radionuclide imaging of cardiac function 
Gated SPECT (GSPECT) 
• As described earlier in the chapter, GSPECT using Tc-99m-labeled perfusion agents (e.g., sestamibi) is most commonly performed for evaluation of ventricular function. 
First-pass radionuclide angiography (FP-RNA) 
• 
Tc-99m-labeled red blood cells (RBCs) are injected intravenously and dynamic imaging is performed during the rapid initial transit of radiotracer through the heart, great vessels, and lungs. The study can be done at both rest and during stress. This study is no longer used in clinical practice. 

• 
Data can be processed for visual and quantitative assessment of ventricular wall motion, ejection fraction (EF), and left-to-right intracardiac shunts. 

• 
FP-RNA is more accurate than E-RNA (below) for evaluation of right ventricular EF. It is not sensitive for right-to-left intracardiac shunts, which can be better detected on a pulmonary perfusion scan with Tc-99m MAA (discussed under “Nuclear Imaging” chapter). 


Equilibrium radionuclide angiography (E-RNA) 

MUGA scan: Representative planar images for calculation of LVEF and stroke volume. 
• 
This is also known as gated blood pool ventriculography or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan. ECG-gated planar blood pool images of the heart are obtained after injected Tc­99m RBCs have achieved equilibrium in the intravascular space. In vitro labeling of RBCs is preferred. E-RNA can also be performed with SPECT (SPECT-E-RNA). 

• 
E-RNA allows visual evaluation of cardiac size, shape, and wall motion, as well as functional 


analysis of ventricular performance. LVEF = (end diastolic counts – end systolic counts) / (end diastolic counts – background counts) The calculated LVEF can be falsely elevated if the selected background region of interest includes part of the left atrium (in case of left atrial enlargement) or extracardiac activity (e.g., spleen). 
• E-RNA is comparable to FP-RNA for measurement of LVEF. However, it has been largely replaced by the more available echocardiography and GSPECT perfusion imaging. 

Nuclear imaging for cardiac inflammation and infection 
Cardiac sarcoidosis 
• 
Sarcoidosis a systemic disease of noncaseating granulomas with cardiac manifestations of arrhythmias, left ventricular dysfunction, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. Cardiac findings are usually seen in conjunction with other manifestations of sarcoidosis, including lung disease and adenopathy. 

• 
F-18 FDG PET is a noninvasive method for diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis and monitoring treatment response. 

• 
Prior to imaging, patient is first placed on a high-fat low-carbohydrate diet for 24 hours prior, then undergoes fasting for at least 12 hours, in order to suppress physiologic glucose metabolism by the myocardium, so that FDG uptake by inflamed myocardium can be detected. 

• 
Cardiac sarcoidosis typically presents as focal or patchy FDG uptake in the myocardium. 

• 
Pitfalls in FDG PET include diffuse myocardial uptake due to incompletely suppressed physiologic uptake, and uptake in the lateral LV wall which can be a normal variant. Mismatch pattern of perfusion defect with focal FDG uptake can represent hibernating myocardium and coronary artery disease, therefore needs to be excluded by CT or invasive angiography or stress perfusion imaging prior to interpretation of the images as focal myocardial inflammation. 

• 
F-18 FDG PET and perfusion imaging can be combined to identify sarcoid-induced tissue damage. Perfusion defect correlating to a focal FDG uptake suggests myocardial fibrosis/ scarring due to advanced sarcoidosis. Perfusion imaging is normal in early stage of disease. 



SA (base) 
Cardiac and systemic sarcoidosis: 
Coronal MIP image of F-18 FDG PET shows increased myocardial uptake in the left ventricle, and increased uptake associated with multiple mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes. 
FDG PET was obtained with a special diet preparation that included 24 hours of high-fat low-carbohydrate diet prior to injection of 10 mCi of F-18 FDG. 
VLA 

Tc-99m sestamibi myocardial perfusion images (top row) and F-18 FDG PET images (bottom row) of the same patient as above. Regions of hypoperfused myocardium (inferior wall and the basal septum, arrows) demonstrate mismatch on FDG PET consistent with active myocardial inflammation (since obstructive coronary artery disease was excluded by coronary angiography). 
Amyloidosis 
• 
Amyloidosis is a systemic disease characterized by extracellular deposition of insoluble proteins; any organ can be affected. Cardiac involvement pertains a poor prognosis and can lead to angina, arrhythmias, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and heart failure. Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis formed from misfolded transthyretin protein is now recognized as a common cause of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in elderly (senile amyloidosis subtype). 

• 
While the gold standard for diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis is tissue biopsy, cardiac imaging such as MRI (discussed later in the chapter) and nuclear imaging offer noninvasive alternatives. 

• 
Radiotracers most commonly used to image cardiac amyloidosis are Tc-99m-labeled bisphosphonates traditionally developed for bone scintigraphy. These agents are helpful in distinguishing between subtypes of amyloidosis, where transthyretin amyloid (senile and hereditary subtypes) takes up more radiotracer than light-chain (AL) amyloid. The mechanism of uptake is not clearly understood. 


Grade 2 (myocardial uptake = rib uptake) or grade 3 (myocardial uptake > rib uptake) myocardial uptake of Tc-99m bisphosphonate tracers on SPECT is nearly 100% specific for the diagnosis of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis if light-chain amyloidosis is excluded. 

Patient with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and increasing left ventricular wall thickening on echocardiogram despite well controlled hypertension: Coronal and sagittal planar images obtained three hours after injection of 20 mCi of Tc-99m pyrophosphate demonstrated grade 3 myocardial uptake of radiotracer (myocardial uptake > rib uptake) which was confirmed on SPECT (not shown). If serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis and serum free light chain assay are negative (which exclude light chain amyloidosis), these findings would be consistent with transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis. 
• Amyloid-specific PET agents (such as F-18 florbetapir and C-11 PiB) are currently undergoing investigation for imaging of cardiac amyloidosis. 
Endocarditis 

Infective endocarditis in a patient with bicuspid aortic valve status post bioprosthetic valve replacement: Echocardiogram was inconclusive. A F-18 FDG PET was performed following a high-fat low-carbohydrate diet. PET images (top row) and PET/CT images (bottom row) demonstrate non-specific myocardial FDG uptake. There is focal FDG uptake in region of the aortic valve (arrows). Endocarditis of the bioprosthetic aortic valve was confirmed intraoperatively. 
• 
F-18 FDG PET/CT can accurately diagnose prosthetic valve endocarditis and its systemic complications. It is less reliable for detection of native valve endocarditis. 

• 
FDG PET can be combined with CT angiography (discussed later in the chapter) for increased sensitivity. 

• 
Radiolabeled leukocyte scintigraphy with SPECT/CT (discussed in the previous chapter) is more specific than FDG PET/CT for evaluation of endocarditis, but suffers from limited sensitivity due to weak signal and lower resolution. 

• 
The typical appearance of endocarditis on FDG PET and leukocyte scintigraphy is a focal valvular uptake.
