
Oblique 3D reformatted image (left) and axial CT image (right) show an aneurysm (arrows) at the bifurcation of the LAD and first diagonal branch in this patient with a history of Kawasaki disease. 
• 
Aneursymal dilatation of the coronary artery is rare and most commonly caused by atherosclerosis in the United States, and Kawasaki disease worldwide. 

• 
Coronary artery aneurysms can be found incidentally on imaging in an asymptomatic patient, or can present with angina or acute coronary syndrome. 

• 
Management of coronary artery aneurysm varies depending on patient’s clinical presentation and risk assessment. 


Cardiac MRI 
Imaging techni.ues 
• 
Cardiac MRI provides high-resolution dynamic imaging of the heart using different pulse sequences. 

• 
Spin echo (SE) has longer acquisition time but yields high spatial resolution and excellent contrast while generating little artifact from metal. Single slices are generated from a single breath hold. SE is used for anatomy. 

• 
Spoiled gradient recalled echo (GRE) is faster but more susceptible to metal artifacts. GRE is used for quantitative measurements, perfusion, and angiography. 

• 
Balanced steady-state free precession (SSFP) is a family of “bright blood” gradient echo sequences. This technique provides high temporal resolution and excellent contrast between myocardium and blood pool. ECG-triggered segmented SSFP is gathered over several heart beats to create a cine to evaluate wall motion, valve function, volume quantification, and can be performed before or after contrast administration. 


Inversion recovery (IR) 
• 
IR pulse nulls the signal from the normal myocardium to accentuate pathology based on picking the appropriate inversion time (TI) on a series of scout images. Normal myocardium is nulled with TI of approximately 300–400 ms after the RF pulse and therefore appears black. The inversion time varies based on volume, contrast relaxivity, excretion rates, and field strength. 

• 
Double IR is used with fast SE sequence as a dark-blood technique where blood appears dark compared to myocardium. 

• 
Triple IR is a dark-blood technique with an additional IR pulse for fat suppression. 




Double IR T1 Double IR T2 Triple IR T2 
Lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum (yellow arrows) on double and triple IR sequences: Note suppression of fat in the interatrial septum and lateral chest wall (red arrow) on triple IR compared to double IR. There is incomplete fat suppression anterior to the heart on the triple IR T2-weighted image. 
• Phase-sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) is a version of IR that acquires a reference phase image in the next heartbeat after the magnitude image is acquired. The phase information is used to calculate the absolute differences in recovery of signal redistributed as grayscale values. This allows for much greater separation between the normal myocardium and abnormal myocardium along a wider range of inversion times based on gadolinium content (i.e., pericardial effusion will be black on PSIR and bright on the magnitude image.) 

Magnitude IR Phase-sensitive IR 
Dynamic first-pass perfusion MRI 
• First-pass contrast-enhanced perfusion MRI is performed pre- and post-vasodilator stress to evaluate myocardial perfusion. Normal myocardium enhances homogeneously, while areas of decreased perfusion will be relatively hypoenhancing. This technique allows for quantitative perfusion. In characterization of cardiac masses, malignant masses generally have more avid first pass perfusion while benign lesions have more mild or modest perfusion. 
Delayed contrast-enhanced MRI 
• 
Delayed contrast-enhanced MRI (DE-MR) is performed using a T1W single inversion recovery gradient echo or SSFP (if there is not enough signal typically at 1.5T). 

• 
Unlike in contrast-enhanced perfusion where first-pass enhancement is normal, any late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in DE-MR is abnormal and represents a delay in washout of gadolinium-based contrast material from the extracellular space. Thus, any process that expands the extracellular space (decreasing the ratio of normal myocytes to extracellular space) will result in delayed enhancement. 

• 
LGE is caused by interstitial fibrosis due to cell death. It can also occur due to nonischemic 

etiologies. Different patterns of enhancement suggest different etiologies. Cardiac: 515 

• 
Phase contrast imaging, also called velocity encoded gradient echo imaging (VENC), measures blood flow perpendicular to the imaging plane, based on differences in phase shift of moving tissue relative to stationary tissue. 

• 
A cine is produced throughout the cardiac cycle. Flow in opposite direction appears black; forward flow appears white. Stationary tissue appears gray. Signal intensity within a region of interest reflects the velocity of flow, such as regurgitation through a valve or pressure gradient across a cardiac shunt. 

• 
The VENC has to be prescribed to interrogate a specific range of velocities. If the velocities measured are outside of this range, they will be misrepresented as aliasing. 



VENC imaging with aliasing: The velocity encoding parameter was picked too low on the left image, resulting in faster flows not appropriately represented and seen as black pixels, called aliasing, within the pulmonary artery (arrow). VENC was corrected in the right image. 
Myocardial tagging 
• 
Myocardial tagging allows assessment of myocardial wall motion and strain. 

• 
RF pulses are applied as tag lines in the image. Grid tags can be applied for myocardial strain analysis or to determine if a myocardial segment is involved by a mass. These grid lines deform as the myocardium contracts and relaxes during the cardiac cycle. Line tags can be applied perpendicular to the myocardial/mass/pericardial interface to assess for adherence or invasion. 



Myocardial tagging demonstrates contraction of the myocardium as indicated by deformation of the grid lines during systole (right image, yellow arrows) compared to diastole (left image). Similar to how the grid lines over the anterior chest wall do not deform, the grid lines over the distal septal mass also maintain their shape (red arrow), indicating the difference between contractile myocardium and a non-contractile mass. 


Reconstruction axes in cardiac mri 

MRI images (left) and 3D volume rendered image (right) showcase the 4 common reconstruction axes in cardiac imaging: 2 chamber or vertical long axis (2CH or VLA), 3 chamber (3CH), 4 chamber or horizontal long axis (4CH or HLA), and short axis (SA). The asterisk 
* represents the LVOT. The white line on the SA view represents the true axial slice. The colored arrows and lines (dotted on SA view, solid on the 3D rendering) represent the relationship between the different axes. 
• 
From the 3 plane localizer images, reconstruction axes are drawn into short axis (SA), 2 chamber (2CH), 3 chamber (3CH) and 4 chamber (4CH) views. 

• 
Short axis plane is perpendicular to the true long axis of the LV, a line drawn from the center of the mitral valve to the LV apex. 

• 
2CH or vertical long axis is the vertical plane orthogonal to the short axis plane and is used to assess ventricular function. This plane bisects the anterior and inferior myocardial segments. 

• 
3CH or LV outflow view is useful for assessing the LVOT, left atrium, mitral valve, aortic valve, anterior septal and posterolateral segments of the LV. 

• 
4CH or horizontal long axis is perpendicular to the short axis and cuts through the widest part of the RV. This is used for assessing chamber volumes, mitral valve, and tricuspid valve. 

• 
Oblique sagittal plane is parallel to the aorta (candy-cane view). 



Delayed enhancement: Ischemic cardiomyopathy 
• Delayed enhancement (late gadolinium enhancement, LGE) post infarction will extend from the subendocardium to the epicardium in a vascular distribution. 
Subendocardial delayed enhancement 
• Since the endocardium is the most susceptible to ischemia, ischemic-type LGE will always involve the subendocardial surface and should have a vascular territory. After remodeling, a chronic infarct will demonstrate LGE. 

Circumferential subendocardial delayed enhancement due to cocaine abuse with myocardial 
necrosis: 
Delayed contrast-enhanced short-axis cardiac MRI shows diffuse subendocardial LGE (arrow) that involves every segment of the LV. The LV is severely dilated. Chronic microvascular ischemia leads to cell death and myocardial necrosis which progresses to fibrosis that manifests as LGE on imaging. 
• Circumferential subendocardial LGE is a rare finding in chronic cocaine users, thought to represent microvascular ischemia from cocaine-induced vasoconstriction. Subepicardial and mesocardial patterns of LGE have also been described. 
Transmural delayed enhancement 

Transmural delayed enhancement due to infarct: 
Delayed contrast-enhanced short-axis cardiac MRI shows transmural LGE (arrows) of the inferior wall of the left ventricle, consistent with transmural infarction in the LAD coronary artery territory. 
• 
Ischemic-type LGE may involve the endocardium only or may be transmural. Transmural LGE extends across the entire myocardial thickness. 

• 
Transmural LGE represents nonviable scar from prior transmural infarct. 

• 
Cine MR images usually demonstrate hypokinesis in the region of abnormal LGE. 




Delayed enhancement: Nonischemic 
• Delayed enhancement not following a vascular territory is not due to ischemia. Several distinct patterns of nonischemic delayed enhancement have been described. 
Mesocardial delayed enhancement 

Mesocardial delayed enhancement due to dilated cardiomyopathy: 
Delayed contrast-enhanced short-axis cardiac MRI shows diffused mesocardial LGE (arrows), a typical pattern in dilated cardiomyopathy. 
• 
Dilated cardiomyopathy is described later in the chapter. 

• 
Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease with cardiac manifestations of arrhythmias, left ventricular dysfunction, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. Cardiac MRI typically shows either mesocardial or subepicardial LGE in a nodular or patchy pattern. 

• 
Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, and can lead to cardiomyopathy. It is a rare diagnosis that is usually accompanied by travel history from South America, specifically Brazil. On cardiac MRI, there is typically epicardial or mesocardial LGE involving the apex, which can be seen even before the development of symptoms. An apical predilection is a unique feature of Chagas myocarditis. 

• 
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is described later in the chapter. Cardiac MRI shows mesocardial LGE, particularly at the RV septal attachment sites and in regions of greatest myocardial hypertrophy. 


Subepicardial delayed enhancement 
• Myocarditis is inflammation of the myocardium, which may be secondary to multiple causes. Viral infection is the most common cause of myocarditis, followed by autoimmune disorders and drug toxicity. In addition to subepicardial LGE, cardiac MRI of myocarditis also shows wall motion abnormalities in the affected regions. 

Subepicardial delayed enhancement due to myocarditis: 
Delayed contrast-enhanced short-axis cardiac MRI shows subepicardial LGE (arrows) in the inferior left ventricular wall. The LV is mildly dilated. 
• Sarcoidosis may cause either mesocardial or subepicardial LGE in a nodular or patchy pattern. 

Delayed enhancement due to sarcoidosis: 
PSIR cardiac MRI image shows multifocal LGE (arrows) with all patterns due to sarcoidosis. 
• Chagas disease may cause epicardial or mesocardial LGE. 
Circumferential subendocardial delayed enhancement 
• 
Amyloidosis is a systemic disorder of glycoprotein deposition throughout the extracellular spaces. In the heart, amyloidosis causes biventricular myocardial thickening, which leads to diffuse ventricular subendocardial LGE. 

• 
Cardiac transplant patients may demonstrate circumferential subendocardial LGE, thought to correlate with the presence of myocardial fibrosis pathologically. 

• 
Hypereosinophilic syndrome is a systemic disorder characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of multiple organs. Cardiac involvement (Loeffler’s endocarditis) leads to endomyocardial fibrosis and subendocardial LGE which can be circumferential. It predominantly affects the cardiac apex and is associated with biventricular thrombi formation.
