• 
The most common cause of mitral stenosis is rheumatic heart disease. 

• 
Mitral stenosis appears as a normal size heart with left atrial enlargement. 

• 
Pulmonary venous pressures are typically elevated. 

• 
Normal mitral valve has an orifice area of 4–6 cm2. A valvular area <1 cm2 and pressure gradient >10 mmHg define severe mitral stenosis. 


Mitral regurgitation 
• 
Mitral regurgitation is most commonly caused by degenerative valvular disease, mitral valve prolapse, rheumatic heart disease, endocarditis, ischemic heart disease, annular calcification, and cardiomyopathy. 

• 
Acute mitral regurgitation secondary to myocardial infarction can present as acute pulmonary edema with a normal size heart. 

• 
Chronic mitral regurgitation can lead to cardiac dilatation and left atrial enlargement. 


The left atrial appendage (LAA) is often enlarged in patients with rheumatic disease; however, the LAA is typically not enlarged in non-rheumatic mitral regurgitation. 
• Mitral valve prolapse is diagnosed when there is prolapse or “bowing” of the valve leaflets greater than 2 mm below the annular plane into the left atrium during systole. 
Mitral annular calcification

• 
Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is a degenerative process where calcium is deposited along the fibrous annulus encircling the mitral valve. 

• 
MAC may be associated with increased risk of stroke, adverse cardiovascular events, and atrial fibrillation. MAC is considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. 

• 
MAC can be associated with mitral regurgitation, but unlike mitral valve calcifications, MAC is not associated with mitral stenosis. 



Right-sided valvular disease 
• The right side of the heart is preferentially involved in patients with carcinoid disease, leading to tricuspid and pulmonic valve dysfunction, although the left-sided valves can be involved as well. 

Pericardial disease 
Pericardial anatomy 
• 
The pericardium consists of two layers (the visceral and parietal pericardium), which are separated by approximately 40 mL of pericardial fluid. 

• 
The pericardial apparatus (combination of the visceral and parietal layers and pericardial fluid) measures <1 mm on cadaveric studies and can be seen on CT and MRI, with a normal thickness <2 mm. A pericardial thickness of =4 mm on imaging is considered abnormal. 



Pericardial effusion: 
Short-axis image from a steady state free precession cardiac MRI demonstrates a large pericardial effusion. 

Pericardial effusion and oreo cookie sign (in a different patient): Frontal radiograph (left image) demonstrates a markedly enlarged heart, which is nonspecific but can be seen in pericardial effusion. Lateral radiograph demonstrates the oreo cookie sign with two parallel lucencies (yellow arrows) indicating the epicardial and pericardial fat stripes surrounding a white “filling” indicating the pericardial effusion (red arrow).

• 
The classic plain film finding of pericardial effusion is the oreo cookie sign, which represents the parallel lucent epicardial and pericardial fat stripes (the cookies) and the radiopaque pericardial effusion (the white filling). 

• 
The primary clinical concern of a pericardial effusion is cardiac tamponade. As little as 100– 200 mL of pericardial fluid can impede diastolic filling if it accumulates quickly. 



Tamponade: 4 chamber SSFP image (left) in diastole shows that the LV is caved in (yellow arrows) due to loculated pericardial effusion (blue arrow) as a result of recent cardiac surgery for mitral valve repair. Short-axis image from a different patient shows a concave LV contour rather than round (red arrow) due to tamponade.

• 
Most cases of acute pericarditis are idiopathic and presumed to be viral. Other causes include tuberculosis, neoplasia, and autoimmune disease. 

• 
Up to 30% of patients have recurrent symptoms of pericardial pain. 

• 
Patients often respond favorably to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 



Acute pericarditis: 
Axial TIR image shows thickening of the pericardium with epicardial and pericardial stranding. The visceral and parietal 
pericardium are edematous as evidenced 
by the increased T2 signal in these layers (arrows). This was a case of idiopathic acute pericarditis. 
Pericardial calcifi cation 

Pericardial calcification: Multiplanar contrast-enhanced CT shows extensive pericardial calcification (arrows). 3D reconstruction (bottom left image) shows the extent of pericardial calcification along the anterolateral right border of the heart (calcification colored in white; arrow). 
• 
Pericardial calcification can be a result of prior pericarditis, most commonly viral or uremic in etiology. Pericardial calcification can be associated with constrictive physiology. 

• 
The main differential of pericardial calcification is myocardial calcification due to old infarct. 

• 
Constrictive pericarditis can occur after any type of pericarditis, most commonly viral or tuberculous pericarditis, uremia, post-radiation or cardiac surgery. 

• 
The pericardium is typically thickened (=4 mm) in constrictive pericarditis. The presence of pericardial adhesions, calcification, and pericardial effusion are also highly suggestive. 

• 
Cine MRI may show paradoxical motion of the ventricular septum (septal bounce). 

• 
Delayed contrast-enhanced MRI shows pericardial LGE due to fibrosis. 

• 
Myocardial tagging shows lack of normal break between the visceral and parietal pericardium during the cardiac cycle, indicating limited motion between the two layers due to adhesions. 

• 
Constrictive pericarditis is treated surgically by pericardial stripping. 



Constrictive pericarditis: 4 chamber SSFP image on the left shows tubular shaped right ventricle with dilated atria. The pericardium is thickened (yellow arrows). Axial T2-weighted image on the right shows dilated IVC (red arrow) due to back pressure from constrictive physiology. 

Congenital absence of the pericardium 

Axial image from a coronary CT shows an abnormal axis of the heart, which is displaced left-posteriorly into the left hemithorax. 
Although a pericardial defect is not directly visualized on this image, the characteristic abnormal cardiac axis should lead one to consider congenital absence of the left pericardium. 

• Congenital absence of the pericardial is a spectrum of disorders ranging from a focal pericardial defect to complete absence of the right and left pericardium. Total absence of the pericardium is very rare. 
• 
The most common form of pericardial absence involves the left pericardium in the region of the left atrial appendage and adjacent pulmonary artery. 

• 
Patients with partial absence of the pericardium are at risk for herniation of a portion of the heart through the pericardial defect.
