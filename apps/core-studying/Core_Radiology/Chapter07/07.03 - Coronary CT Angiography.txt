
Coronary CT angiography 
Evidence for using coronary CT to evaluate for ischemic cardiac disease 
• 
Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is an excellent test to rule out hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease (CAD). Meta-analyses of multiple trials have shown the negative predictive value for CCTA to be approaching 100%. 

• 
In the emergency room setting, CCTA is an appropriate first-line test for evaluation of acute chest pain in low to intermediate risk patients without known CAD, who presented with normal cardiac enzymes and non-ischemic ECG. 

• 
For patients with high pretest probability of acute coronary syndrome, the appropriate diagnostic approach is functional assessment such as stress testing or invasive coronary angiography. 

• 
For patients with equivocal stress tests, a negative CCTA may suggest against admission or further invasive testing. 

• 
CCTA is very sensitive for hemodynamically significant (>50% lumenal diameter) stenoses; however, a stenosis found on CT may be overcalled, especially if there is calcified plaque, which can cause a blooming artifact. 

• 
Other indications of CCTA include coronary assessment prior to cardiac or other major surgery, evaluation of suspected coronary anomalies, cardiac valves, and coronary artery bypass grafts. 


ECG gating and radiation dose 
• ECG gating is used to minimize cardiac motion. The choice of ECG gating has a large effect on patient radiation dose. 
To estimate the radiation dose, the dose-length product (DLP) should be multiplied by a conversion factor of 0.017 to arrive at the dose in millisieverts. 
• In a retrospectively gated exam, continuous CT scanning is performed throughout the cardiac cycle and the images are correlated to the ECG cycle afterwards. 
The main advantage of retrospective gating is the ability to create cine reconstructions to evaluate cardiac and valvular function, typically with 10–20 frames per cardiac cycle. The main disadvantage of retrospective gating is a significant increase in radiation exposure compared to a 
prospectively gated study. 
• For prospective gating, the ECG is used to time image acquisition at a specific phase of the 
cardiac cycle, exposing the patient to radiation only during this segment of the cardiac cycle. The main advantage of prospective gating is decreased radiation exposure. However, since only a fraction of the cardiac cycle is acquired, cine reconstructions are not possible.

Spatial resolution 
• 
Coronary arteries have an average lumenal diameter of approximately 3 mm. 

• 
The latest CT scanners have a spatial resolution up to 0.18 mm. Axial image reconstructions should have slice thickness <1.0 mm for optimal evaluation of coronary arteries. Thicker slices may be used in obese patients to reduce image noise. 

• 
In contrast, catheter angiography has a spatial resolution of approximately 0.16 mm. 


Temporal resolution and “freezing” of cardiac motion 
• 
A single source CT scanner requires slightly more than 180 degrees of gantry rotation for image acquisition. For a complete rotation time of 330 ms, the temporal resolution is ~165 ms , calculated as rotation time/2. 

• 
Dual source CT has two X-ray sources oriented 90 degrees to each other and needs to rotate only 90 degrees to complete a reconstruction, which effectively cuts the temporal resolution to 1/4 of the gantry rotation time. For third-generation dual source CTs with a rotation time of 250 ms, the temporal resolution is ~66 ms. 



Intravenous access 
• Appropriate intravenous access is required for rapid bolus administration of contrast via a power injector. High infusion rates (4–7 mL/sec) are needed to adequately opacify the coronary arteries. A saline chaser bolus follows the contrast injection to wash out the veins and right atrium, in order to reduce streak artifact from the contrast bolus. 
Target heart rate and pre-scanning medications 
• 
A low heart rate (=60 bpm) and regular rhythm are desired to maximize the R-R interval. 

• 
Beta-blockade is usually necessary to achieve the target heart rate. Oral metoprolol is administered (between 5 and 25 mg, typically administered in 5 mg doses). Oral beta-blocker gives better heart rate control and decreased heart rate variability compared to IV. 


With dual source CT, it is possible to scan without heart rate control, even for patients with arrhythmias. 
• Just prior to scanning, a sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4–0.8 mg) is administered to dilate the coronary arteries.

Coronary artery origination 
• 
Most commonly, two coronary arteries originate from the proximal aorta at the sinuses of Valsalva. High take-off from the sinotubular junction or above is the most common anomaly. 

• 
There are three coronary sinuses. Oblique quasi-axial view through the aorta at the sinotubular junction The RCA arises from the right coronary sinus (located anterior). The left main coronary artery arises from the left coronary sinus (located left-posterior, adjacent to 


R
left atrial appendage). No branch arises from the noncoronary sinus (located right-posterior and straddles the interatrial septum). 


Left main coronary artery (LMCA) 
• The left main coronary artery (LMCA) courses between the pulmonary artery and the left atrial appendage. LAD 
ramus 
• The LMCA bifurcates into left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCx) arteries. A ramus 

LCx branch may be present to form a trifurcation. 



Left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery 
• 
The left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery courses in the anterior interventricular groove, which is the anatomic groove between the right and left ventricles. 

• 
The LAD gives off the diagonal branches (LAD–Diagonal) and septal branches, which penetrate the interventricular septum to supply blood to the anterior 1/2 of the septum. 


Left circumflex (LCx) coronary artery 
• 
The left circumflex (LCx) coronary artery courses underneath the left atrial appendage in the left atrioventricular groove (between the left ventricle and left atrium). 

• 
The LCx artery gives off the obtuse marginal (OM; circOMflex) branch, which supplies the posterolateral wall of the left ventricle. The left margin of the heart has an obtuse angle, hence the name. 

• 
The LCx uncommonly (~7%) supplies the posterior descending artery (PDA), which is the criteria for a left-dominant system. In the anatomic diagram on the previous page, the more common right-dominant system is shown, where the right coronary artery supplies the PDA. 


Right coronary artery (RCA) 
Axial Axial Axial Sagittal 




• 
The right coronary artery (RCA) mirrors the LCx in course, sitting within the right atrioventricular groove. The first branches of the RCA are the conal branch anteriorly (supplies the right ventricular outflow tract) and the sinoatrial node branch posteriorly. 

• 
The RCA gives off an acute marginal branch which courses anterior to the right ventricular (RV) free wall and muscular branches to supply the RV free wall (not drawn). Margin of the RV has an acute angle, hence the name. 

• 
The atrioventricular nodal branch (AVN) branches off at the crux (junction of all 4 chambers where the atrioventricular and interventricular grooves intersect). 

• 
The posterior descending artery (PDA) arises from the RCA in approximately 85% to supply the posterior 1/2 of the ventricular septum. 

• 
The terminal branch of the RCA is most commonly the posterolateral artery (PLA) that supplies the posterior left ventricle. 



Determination of dominance 
• 
The side which supplies the PDA, PLA, and AVN is the dominant coronary artery. Most commonly, in about 85% of cases, the RCA is the dominant artery. 

• 
Left-dominant anatomy is uncommon, occurring in approximately 7% of cases. In left-dominant anatomy, the LCx supplies the PDA, PLA, and AVN. 

• 
Codominant anatomy can also be seen in approximately 7% of cases, typically with the RCA supplying the PDA, while the LCx supplies PLA. 



Structural coronary artery anomalies 
Coronary artery anomalies: Overview 
• 
Coronary artery anomalies are rare and include those of the artery origin, course, or termination. These can be malignant or benign. A malignant coronary artery anomaly carries an increased risk of sudden death (in up to 40% of patients), often associated with exercise. 

• 
CCTA is the best modality to evaluate anomalous coronary artery anatomy. 

• 
Anomalies of coronary artery origin include: 


Coronary artery arising from the pulmonary artery, which is malignant. Either the right or left main coronary artery may arise from the pulmonary artery. Both are very rare. Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA). Anomalous right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ARCAPA). RCA arising from left coronary sinus. Left main coronary artery (LMCA) arising from right coronary sinus. Left circumflex (LCx) or left anterior descending (LAD) arising from right coronary sinus. Any artery arising from the noncoronary sinus. 
• Anomalies of coronary artery course include: 
Interarterial course (between the aorta and pulmonary artery) of an anomalous coronary artery is malignant. 
Intramural course (within the aortic wall) of a coronary artery is malignant. 
Retroaortic, prepulmonic, and septal (subpulmonic) coronary artery courses are all considered benign. Myocardial bridging (described later in this chapter) is often benign. 
• Anomaly of coronary artery termination: 
Coronary artery fistula (described later in the chapter) 


Benign coronary artery anomaly 

Prepulmonic (benign) course of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery: 
Axial image from a gated coronary CT shows an anomalous course of the LAD, which runs anterior (arrows) to the pulmonary artery (PA).

• An aberrant coronary artery course is considered clinically benign if the coronary artery does not course between the aorta and the pulmonary artery. 

Malignant coronary artery anomaly 
• Anomalous intramural course of either the RCA or LMCA is seen when the vessel courses through the wall of the aorta for a short segment. This anomaly is associated with sudden death. There is typically a slit-like configuration of the coronary artery on CCTA. 
The treatment of intramural coronary artery is bypass, reimplantation, or the unroofing procedure. 

Malignant coronary artery anomaly (continued) 
Malignant: Anomalous origin of LEFT coronary Malignant: Anomalous origin of RIGHT coronary artery arising from the RIGHT coronary sinus, artery arising from the LEFT coronary sinus, passing between the aorta and the PA. passing between the aorta and the PA. 


Malignant course of anomalous right coronary artery: 
Sequential axial images from a coronary CTA show anomalous origin of the right coronary artery (arrow) from the left coronary sinus, which then courses between the aorta and the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). 
Case courtesy Michael Hanley, MD, University of Virginia Health System. 
• Anomalous interarterial course (between the pulmonary artery or RV outflow tract and the aorta) of a coronary artery carries a high risk of sudden death of up to 40%, associated with exercise. It is thought that dilation of the aorta occurs during exercise, which may compress the anomalous vessel resulting in myocardial infarction. 
Either an anomalous left coronary artery or anomalous right coronary artery may take a malignant interarterial course. Treatment is surgical bypass grafting. 
Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) / Bland-White-Garland syndrome 
• 
Also called Bland-White-Garland syndrome, anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a very rare but serious coronary artery anomaly, where the left coronary artery arises from the pulmonary artery. Most affected patients are infants, with over 90% mortality in the first year of life if untreated. 

• 
Treatment is surgical, with either direct implantation of the anomalous coronary artery (in children) or ligation of the anomalous vessel in conjunction with bypass grafting (in adults). 

• 
Less commonly, the RCA may arise from the pulmonary artery. This is known as anomalous right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ARCAPA). Treatment is similar. 


Myocardial bridging 

Curved multiplanar reconstruction and cross-sectional CT images demonstrate myocardial bridging of the proximal RCA (arrows). 
• 
Myocardial bridging describes a band of myocardium overlying a segment of a coronary artery, most commonly seen in the mid or distal LAD. 

• 
Myocardial bridging is usually asymptomatic; however, it may be a cause of angina, myocardial infarction, or even death. 

• 
If bridging is present and thought to be the source of the patient’s symptoms, further evaluation is recommended with exercise myocardial perfusion. 


Coronary artery fi stula 

3D volume rendered image (left) demonstrates tortuosity and diffuse aneurysmal dilatation of the LAD and two diagonal branches, which converge in a large bilobed aneurysm at the cardiac apex. CT image (right) shows a communication (arrow) between the distal portion of the aneurysm and the right ventricle, representing a coronary cameral fistula. 
• 
Abnormal connection can occur between a coronary artery branch and a coronary vein, other lower pressure vascular system (e.g., pulmonary artery), another coronary artery or systemic artery, or a cardiac chamber (in which case it is called a coronary cameral fistula). 

• 
Majority of coronary artery fistulas are congenital. Uncommon etiologies include trauma, iatrogenic injury, infection, or radiation-induced. 

• 
When a fistula occurs between a coronary artery and a lower pressure vascular system, CT may show dilated tortuous coronary arteries and epicardial feeding vessels. There is often aneurysmal dilation of the coronary artery proximal to the fistula. 



Coronary artery disease 
Coronary artery calcium score 
• 
A gated noncontrast cardiac CT can be obtained independently or prior to contrast- enhanced CCTA for calcium scoring. Coronary artery calcification is a marker for CAD. 

• 
Any area = 3 pixels in a coronary artery with density greater than 130 HU is considered to contain calcium. The Agatston score represents the total calcium in the coronary tree. It can predict the risk of future major adverse cardiovascular events and guide preventive therapy. 

• 
Coronary calcium scoring is appropriate for risk stratification in asymptomatic patients without known CAD and with: 


(1) An intermediate 10-year ASCVD (arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease) risk estimate; Or (2) a family history of premature CAD and a low 10-year ASCVD risk estimate. 
Coronary artery stenosis 
• 
The Coronary Artery Disease Reporting and Data System (CAD-RADS) was introduced in 2016 to provide standard classification of CAD, reduce reader variability, and facilitate communication between interpreting and referring clinicians. 

• 
CAD-RADS categories 0, 1, and 2 (stenosis <50%) represent nonobstructive CAD and do not require further workup. Non-atherosclerotic causes of patient’s chest pain should be considered. 

• 
Stenosis >50% is considered obstructive and potentially hemodynamically significant, which requires further workup. CAD-RADS 3 is moderate stenosis (50–69%). CAD-RADS 4 is severe stenosis (70–99%) or significant stenosis (>50%) in the left main coronary artery (LMCA). 

• 
CAD-RADS 5 is total occlusion of at least one coronary artery. 

• 
When one or more coronary artery segment is not evaluable and the rest show <50% stenosis, the study is considered nondiagnostic (CAD-RADS category N). Coronary segments smaller than 1.5 mm in diameter are not classifiable by CAD-RADS. 


CAD­RADS  Interpretation  Stenosis  Workup and management  
0  No CAD  0%  Reassurance.  
1  Minimal CAD  1–24%  Preventative therapy.  
2  Mild CAD  25–49%  Preventative therapy.  
3  Moderate stenosis  50–69%  Consider functional testing and preventative therapy.  
4  Severe stenosis  70–99%, or >50% LMCA  Functional testing or invasive coronary angiography. Consider revascularization.  
5  Occlusion  100%  Same as for CAD-RADS 4.  


Plaque vulnerability 
• 
High-risk (vulnerable) atherosclerotic plaques are associated with increased risk of acute coronary syndrome. High-risk features include low-attenuation plaque (<30 HU), spotty calcification, positive remodeling, and the napkin-ring sign. 

• 
There is no established guideline for management of patients with vulnerable plaques. 



Napkin-ring sign: low-Low-attenuation plaque 
attenuation core (yellow (arrow) measures less arrow) surrounded by than 30 HU on CTA. higher attenuation rim (red arrow). 

Positive remodeling: characterized by compensatory enlargement of the vessel wall at site of plaque (yellow arrows) beyond the normal caliber (red arrows), with preserved vessel lumen. 
Also seen are spotty calcifications (blue arrows). 

Evaluation of coronary stents and bypass grafts 
• 
Two major complications following coronary artery stenting are stent thrombosis (in the acute setting) and in-stent restenosis (a late complication). In-stent restenosis occurs by neointimal hyperplasia and appears as low-attenuation material within the stent lumen. 

• 
Unfortunately, CCTA evaluation of coronary stents remains difficult and adequate visualization of the stent lumen depends on various factors, including stent type, diameter, location, presence of motion or blooming artifacts. 



Cross-sectional CTA image of a coronary stent shows low-attenuation material in the lumen, consistent with in-stent restenosis. 
• 
Potential complications of bypass grafts are graft stenosis, occlusion, and aneurysm formation. One pitfall on imaging is that a completely occluded graft can be difficult to discern, with the only hint being an outpouching at the graft-aortic anastomosis. 

• 
Coronary bypass grafts can be accurately evaluated by CCTA, however because beam hardening and streak artifacts from adjacent surgical clips can obscure findings, cardiac catheterization remains the preferred diagnostic modality at most locations. 

• 
Stenoses of both coronary stents and bypass grafts are graded similarly to those of native coronary arteries, using the CAD-RADS.
