Ischemic heart disease 
Imaging of myocardial infarction 
Plain fi lm evaluation of myocardial infarction 
• The majority of initial plain chest radiographs obtained in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) are normal; however, the most common abnormality seen is increased pulmonary venous pressure (or overt pulmonary edema). 
The presence of pulmonary edema after MI is a poor prognostic indicator. 
• The plain chest radiograph can evaluate for some complications of acute MI such as pericardial effusion, left ventricular aneurysm, and papillary muscle rupture. It can also suggest an alternative cause for the patient’s acute chest pain, such as pneumothorax or pneumonia. 
MR imaging of myocardial infarction 
• Similar to stress echocardiography and nuclear scintigraphy (discussed earlier in this chapter), cardiac MRI can be used with pharmacologic stress to evaluate for myocardial ischemia. Cine MRI demonstrates wall motion abnormality or decreased wall thickening in affected coronary artery territory. Stress perfusion MRI demonstrates regional perfusion deficit on first-pass contrast-enhanced images; the subendocardial layer is always involved. 

Pharmacologic stress cardiac MRI shows RCA ischemia (left image is rest, right is stress): First-pass cine images show regadenoson-induced first pass myocardial perfusion defect involving the apical inferior and inferoseptal segments (red arrows) in keeping with moderate size ischemia in the right coronary artery territory. 
• 
Myocardial viability can be assessed by delayed contrast-enhanced MRI. Both acute (necrotic) and chronic (fibrotic) myocardial infarctions show late gadolinium enhancement, while viable myocardium does not. 

• 
Greater than 50% transmural LGE indicates low likelihood of recovery of function after revascularization therapy. 

• 
Myocardial edema in region of acute infarct demonstrates increased T2 signal and is usually larger than the area of LGE (necrotic myocardium). The edematous region without LGE represents myocardium at risk for ischemia.

MR imaging of myocardial infarction (continued) 

T2-weighted TIR T2 mapping Myocardial edema: T2-weighted triple inversion recovery image shows relatively increased T2 hyperintense signal of the anterior and anterolateral segments (arrows) in keeping with edema. This finding is confirmed with T2 mapping color image. 
• Acute infarct with microvascular obstruction appears on delayed contrast-enhanced MRI as areas of hypoenhancement within an enhancing infarct zone. Microvascular obstruction is usually seen following reperfusion therapy after prolonged myocardial ischemia. It is a strong poor prognostic indicator and is associated with more severe LV remodeling. 

Microvascular obstruction in the setting of acute 
infarct: 
There is diffuse subendocardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) involving the anterior and anterolateral walls, consistent with non-transmural myocardial infarction with microvascular obstruction (yellow arrow). There is also a large central dark zone (red arrow) with surrounding edema consistent with intramyocardial hemorrhage involving the inferior and inferolateral walls of the LV, from large recent infarct in LCx territory. 
CT imaging of myocardial infarction 
• 
Conventional CT is not routinely performed for evaluation of MI or its complications, although these findings may be incidentally seen. 

• 
Acute myocardial ischemia appears on contrast-enhanced CT as wall hypoattenuation in a coronary artery distribution, progressing from the subendocardial layer to transmural. Subsequent myocyte death leads to decreased wall thickness. Myocardial scar from a prior MI can present as dense irregular myocardial calcification or thin, fatty-replaced myocardium, again in a coronary artery distribution. 



Myocardial infarction on CT: reformatted CT angiogram short-axis view shows thinned anterolateral LV wall with curvilinear hypodense signal along the endometrium (arrows) in keeping with fatty metaplasia from prior infarct.

• New advances in CT have allowed functional myocardial imaging, including stress and rest CT perfusion and myocardial delayed enhancement CT, similar to cardiac MRI. 


Complications of myocardial infarction 
• 
Acute complications of MI include cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, arrhythmia, mural thrombus, papillary muscle rupture, ventricular septal rupture, cardiac free-wall rupture, and pericarditis. 

• 
Chronic complications of MI include heart failure, left ventricular aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm, and mural thrombus. 


Papillary muscle rupture 

Frontal chest radiograph demonstrates 
asymmetric pulmonary edema in the right upper lobe (arrow) in this patient with known severe mitral regurgitation from recent myocardial infarction. Left pleural effusion and mild cardiomegaly are also present. 
• Papillary muscle rupture due to MI typically produces acute pulmonary edema. A classic radiographic finding is isolated right upper lobe pulmonary edema due to acute mitral regurgitation resulting from papillary muscle rupture. 
True left ventricular (LV) aneurysm 
• 
A true ventricular aneurysm is a focal outpouching affecting all layers of the muscular wall. 

• 
True LV aneurysms are associated with occlusion of the LAD. The most common location is along the anterolateral or apical wall of the left ventricle. 

• 
Plain film findings include an abnormal contour along the midportion of the left cardiac border near the apex. CT or MRI shows wall thinning, possible calcification, and a wide neck between the ventricular lumen and the aneurysm. 



Calcified LV aneurysm: Frontal radiograph shows thin curvilinear density along the border of the LV (arrow), corresponding to calcified LV aneurysm as sequelae of prior myocardial infarction.
