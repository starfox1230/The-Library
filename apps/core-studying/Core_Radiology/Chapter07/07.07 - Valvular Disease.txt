Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM; continued) 

Nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy: Delayed-enhancement short-axis cardiac MRI (left image) shows no abnormal enhancement, but there is diffuse concentric dilation of the left ventricular and right ventricular cavities, which is also appreciated on the axial image (right image). Bilateral small pleural effusions are present.

• 
An ischemic cause can be suggested by delayed enhancement in a vascular distribution on MRI or coronary artery disease seen on CCTA. 

• 
Up to 41% of patients with idiopathic DCM demonstrate abnormal mesocardial LGE in a nonischemic distribution in the mid-ventricular wall. The significance of this enhancement in these patients is uncertain. 

• 
Catheter angiography is recommended to exclude coronary artery disease in a new diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy. 


Valvular disease 
Endocarditis 
• 
Endocarditis is infection of the cardiac valves. Risk factors for development of endocarditis include intravenous drug abuse, poor dental hygiene, diabetes, and prosthetic valves. 

• 
Valvular vegetations are usually diagnosed by echocardiography, although CT angiography is routinely able to depict vegetations >1 cm in diameter. CT can also evaluate for the presence of a perivalvular abscess and assess for extracardiac complications of endocarditis, such as septic pulmonary emboli. 


Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) 
• 
Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congential cardiovascular abnormality. 

• 
Acquired BAV occurs when fusion of two cusps of a trileaflet valve results in a functional bicuspid valve, often due to leaflet calcification or rheumatic heart disease. 

• 
BAV is classified into three types depending on the number of raphes present. A raphe is 

defined as the fusion point between two adjacent rudimentary coronary cusps. Number of raphes: 0 (type 0), 1 (type 1), 2 (type 2) 

• 
Images of the BAV have a characteristic fishmouth appearance. 

• 
BAV predisposes to early onset degenerative aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and infective endocarditis. 

• 
Other abnormalities associated with BAV include aortic coarctation, supravalvular stenosis, ascending aortic aneurysm, aortopathy leading to aortic dissection, patent ductus arteriosus, Turner syndrome, and coronary artery anomalies.

BAV type 0: no raphe 
BAV type 1: raphe between the right coronary cusp and the left coronary cusp (arrow) 
BAV type 2: raphe between the right coronary cusp and the non-coronary cusp (arrow) 


Aortic stenosis 
• 
Valvular aortic stenosis is most commonly caused by congenital bicuspid aortic valve, age-associated degeneration, or rheumatic heart disease. 

• 
Subvalvular aortic stenosis can occur due to obstruction by a fibrous membrane beneath the aortic cusps, fibromuscular ring or narrowing of the LV outlet, redundant mitral valve tissue, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 

• 
Supravalvular aortic stenosis is rare and occurs either as an isolated congenital anomaly or associated with Williams syndrome. 

• 
Aortic stenosis causes left ventricular hypertrophy; however, the heart size does not change. 

• 
The ascending aorta is usually enlarged in long-standing valvular aortic stenosis. 

• 
Pulmonary vascularity is typically normal. 

• 
Normal aortic valve has an orifice area >2 cm2. A valvular area <1 cm2 and pressure gradient >40 mmHg define severe aortic stenosis. 


Aortic regurgitation 
• 
Aortic regurgitation can result from abnormality of the aortic valve, aortic annulus, or ascending aorta. 

• 
Long-standing aortic regurgitation causes left ventricular enlargement, which is apparent on radiographs as cardiomegaly. There is typically enlargement of the ascending aorta. 

• 
Similar to aortic stenosis, the pulmonary vasculature is typically normal.
