
• True ventricular aneurysms are associated with wall motion dyskinesia but they rarely rupture. Management is medical. 
LV aneurysm: 4 chamber bright-blood 
imaging demonstrates ballooning of 
the LV apex (arrows) and thinning of the anterior LV wall in keeping with true aneurysm. 

Pseudoaneurysm 
• 
A cardiac pseudoaneurysm is a contained ventricular rupture, with only pericardial adhesions preventing a complete rupture. There is no myocardium in the wall of a pseudoaneurysm. 

• 
Pseudoaneurysms are associated with occlusion of the circumflex or right coronary arteries and most commonly occur along the inferior, inferolateral or posterior wall of the LV. 

• 
Plain film findings suggestive of a LV pseudoaneurysm include a retrocardiac density seen on the frontal view and an abnormal posterior contour on the lateral radiograph. CT or MRI shows a narrow aneurysmal neck. The affected region is akinetic and the overlying pericardium often demonstrates LGE on MRI. 

• 
Ventricular pseudoaneurysms may rupture. An increase in size over sequential films is especially worrisome for impending rupture. Treatment of a pseudoaneurysm is surgical. 


Dressler syndrome 
• Dressler syndrome is a subacute immune-mediated pericarditis which often occurs 2–6 weeks following MI. It is manifests as pericardial and pleural effusions. 

Non-ischemic myocardial disease 
Catecholamine induced (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy 
• 
Catecholamine induced cardiomyopathy, also known as takotsubo cardiomyopathy and broken heart syndrome, can clinically mimic acute myocardial infarction. 

• 
Typically affecting older women in the setting of acute emotional stress, catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy can present with chest pain, abnormal ECG, and elevation of cardiac enzymes. Cardiac catheterization is normal. 


One theory is that men may suffer catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy as well but typically don’t survive. There may be a protective effect of estrogen. 
• 
Catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy is typically self-limited. 

• 
On cardiac MRI or coronary CT, there is a characteristic ballooning of the cardiac apex. The shape of the heart is similar to a Japanese octopus pot, hence the name takotsubo. There is no abnormal delayed enhancement on MRI. 



3D volume rendered image from a cardiac CT (with the myocardium removed) demonstrates marked ballooning of the left ventricular apex (arrows). The coronary arteries are normal. 

Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy 

ARVD: Cardiac MRI shows regional RV akinesis most pronounced in the mid-free wall (arrow). There is dyssynchronous RV contraction between the base and apex. RV ejection fraction in this case was 31%, meeting major criteria for ARVD. Note severe right atrial enlargement. 
• 
Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (previously called arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, as it was thought to only affect the right ventricle) represents fibrofatty replacement of ventricular myocytes, causing focal contraction abnormalities and/or aneurysm formation. 

• 
Diagnosis is usually difficult and depends on major and minor criteria from ECG, imaging, biopsy findings, and family history, as determined by the 2010 International Task Force consensus. Imaging plays a supportive role in the diagnosis. Imaging findings may contribute one major and one minor criteria based on the presence of right ventricular dyskinesia or akinesia and either an increased RV volume or reduced RV ejection fraction. The presence of myocardial fat is no longer in the criteria as fat can be seen in normal individuals with aging. 

• 
Left ventricular involvement can be seen in up to 3/4 of patients. 

• 
Patients may suffer lethal arrhythmias and therefore require ICD placement once diagnosis is confirmed. 



Myocardial noncompaction: Short-axis and axial cine images show hypertrabeculated noncompacted myocardium (arrows) in the left ventricle with noncompaction-to-compaction ratio greater than 2.3. 
• 
Myocardial noncompaction is a developmental defect in embryologic formation of the left ventricle, due to failure of part of the left ventricle to form a solid myocardium. 

• 
On imaging, the left ventricle appears as heavily trabeculated as the right ventricle with a relatively thin left ventricular wall. A noncompacted to compacted myocardium ratio =2.3 at end diastole is a proposed criteria that is highly sensitive but not specific. 

• 
Patients with noncompaction have an increased risk of adverse cardiac events, including arrhythmias, thrombus formation, stroke, and cardiomyopathy. 


Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) 

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Short-axis (left image) steady-state free precession MRI shows concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricular myocardium (yellow arrows), without chamber enlargement. A small pericardial effusion is present. Three-chamber view (right image) from the same study better shows the septal predominance of the ventricular hypertrophy (arrows).

• 
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominant cardiomyopathy, characterized by left ventricular myocardial thickening (diffuse or focal) without dilation. HCM is the most common cardiomyopathy. 

• 
Cardiac MRI may show patchy mid-myocardial LGE in regions of hypertrophied myocardium and at the junctions of the interventricular septum and the right ventricular free wall, due to myofibril disarray. Evaluation of the cine images will show reduced diastolic filling of the left ventricle. 

• 
The asymmetric septal hypertrophy variant, known as idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS), may cause left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Diagnostic criteria include an end-diastolic wall thickness of =15 mm and a ratio of =1.5 compared to the lateral wall. A wall thickness =30 mm is an indication for ICD placement. 

• 
The apical HCM variant is more commonly seen in Asians and has the classic imaging appearance of a “spade-shaped” left ventricle. 

• 
Systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve is an associated finding that can cause mitral regurgitation and resultant left atrial enlargement. 

• 
Although diagnosis is usually made by echocardiography, indications for MRI are to confirm the diagnosis of HCM, to measure the left ventricular mass, and to quantify the degree of subvalvular stenosis. 



Restrictive cardiomyopathy 

Impaired diastolic filling: Contrast-enhanced CT demonstrates dilation and reflux of contrast into the IVC and hepatic veins (arrow), indicative of impaired right ventricular filling and resultant dilation of the right atrium, IVC, and hepatic veins. 
Case courtesy Michael Hanley, MD, University of Virginia Health System. 
• 
Restrictive cardiomyopathy is characterized by small, stiff, thickened ventricles that impair diastolic filling. This results in dilated atria and ultimately a dilated IVC. The etiology of the restrictive cardiomyopathy may be idiopathic or due to sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, hypereosinophilic syndrome (e.g., Loeffler’s endocarditis), or myocardial deposition diseases (e.g., amyloidosis). 

• 
Note that restrictive cardiomyopathy and constrictive physiology are different entities, although both conditions may feature identical ventricular pressure tracings and both are characterized by impaired diastolic filling. 

• 
Constrictive physiology (subsequently discussed under pericardial disease) is secondary to increased pericardial pressure from thickened (often calcified) pericardium or pericardial effusion, causing impaired diastolic filling. 

• 
The main role of imaging the heart in impaired diastolic filling is to exclude constrictive pericarditis as the etiology of the diastolic dysfunction. Constrictive pericarditis can be treated surgically by removing the pericardium; however, there is no effective treatment for restrictive cardiomyopathy and patients tend to have a poor prognosis. 


Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) 
• 
Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by diffuse cardiac chamber enlargement with impaired systolic function. Typically, both ventricles are involved. 

• 
DCM can be ischemic or nonischemic in etiology. It is the most common nonischemic cardiomyopathy, often idiopathic, with other causes including alcohol abuse, myocarditis, or drug toxicity. Evaluation by MRI or CT is useful to determine the etiology.
