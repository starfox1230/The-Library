Plain film imaging of heart disease 
• 
By applying a systematic approach, the standard chest radiograph can offer valuable information about the presence or severity of heart disease. 

• 
The radiographic evaluation of heart disease begins with an assessment of the size of the cardiac silhouette. Radiographically evident heart disease can be divided into two categories: Those with a normal-sized cardiac silhouette and those with an enlarged cardiac silhouette. 

• 
A ratio of the cardiac silhouette to the inner diameter of the thorax (the cardiothoracic ratio) of 0.55 or greater (on a PA projection) suggests enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. 

• 
Cardiovascular diseases with an enlarged cardiac silhouette include cardiomyopathy secondary to congestive heart failure, valvular regurgitation (aortic, mitral, or tricuspid regurgitation), high-output or volume overload states, dilated cardiomyopathy, pericardial effusion, and paracardiac mass. 

• 
To distinguish between the various causes of enlarged cardiac silhouette, the key structures to evaluate are the left atrium and the aorta. 


If the left atrium is enlarged and the cardiac silhouette is enlarged, that suggests mitral regurgitation. If the aorta is enlarged and the cardiac silhouette is enlarged, that suggests aortic regurgitation. If neither the left atrium nor the aorta is enlarged, that suggests one of the other etiologies. 
• 
Cardiovascular diseases with a normal-sized cardiac silhouette include valvular stenosis (aortic or mitral stenosis), pulmonary artery hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, restrictive physiology, and acute myocardial infarction. 

• 
Similar to evaluation of diseases with an enlarged cardiac silhouette, the key structures to evaluate in the presence of a normal cardiac silhouette are the left atrium and the aorta. 


If the left atrium is enlarged and the cardiac silhouette is normal, that suggests mitral stenosis. 
If the aorta is enlarged and the cardiac silhouette is normal, that suggests aortic stenosis or aortic aneurysm. If neither the left atrium nor the aorta is enlarged, that suggests one of the other etiologies. 
• Other structures to always evaluate include the pulmonary vascularity, thoracic wall, chamber enlargement, and the great vessels (pulmonary arteries, ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta). 
Right ventricular enlargement 
• 
The right ventricle is the most anterior cardiac chamber. Right ventricular enlargement causes displacement of the cardiac apex in a leftward direction (in contrast to left ventricular enlargement, which causes displacement in a left-inferior direction). 

• 
Right ventricular enlargement may cause opacification of the retrosternal clear space on the lateral radiograph. 



Right atrial enlargement 
• The right atrium forms the right heart border. Right atrial enlargement causes lateral bulging or elongation of the right heart border. 

Left ventricular enlargement 
• 
The left ventricle forms the left heart border. Left ventricular enlargement typically causes displacement of the cardiac apex in a left-inferior direction. 

• 
Note that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy does not cause enlargement of the external contour of the ventricle. 



Left atrial enlargement 
• 
The left atrium is the most posterior cardiac chamber. An enlarged left atrium may be caused by mitral regurgitation (with an enlarged cardiac silhouette) or mitral stenosis (with a normal cardiac silhouette). 

• 
An enlarged left atrium can splay the carina, seen on the frontal view. On the lateral radiograph, an enlarged left atrium can elevate the left upper lobe bronchus. 



Left atrial enlargement with cardiomegaly (due to mitral regurgitation): Frontal chest radiograph (left image) demonstrates massive cardiomegaly with marked enlargement of the left atrium, as evident by splaying of the carina (arrow). Lateral radiograph shows marked posterior displacement of the esophagus (arrows). A prosthetic mitral valve is present.

• An important clue to the presence of left atrial enlargement is the double density sign, seen over the right heart. The double density represents the right aspect of the enlarged left atrium visualized through the right atrium. 

Left atrial enlargement without cardiomegaly (due to mitral stenosis): Frontal chest radiograph (left image) demonstrates the double density sign (arrow) with the left atrial border visualized through the right atrium. Lateral radiograph demonstrates posterior protrusion of the left atrium (arrow).

• On a lateral esophogram, an enlarged left atrium can displace the esophagus posteriorly and may be a cause of dysphagia. 
Imaging of prosthetic valves 

Prosthetic aortic (A), mitral (M), and tricuspid (T) valves. Note that on the lateral radiograph (right image) the aortic valve is located on a plane drawn from the sternal/diaphragmatic junction and the carina (yellow line). 

Prosthetic aortic (A), pulmonic (P), and tricuspid (T) valves in a different patient. The tricuspid prosthesis is a ring annuloplasty. The aortic valve is seen on the plane connecting the sternal/diaphragmatic junction with the carina on the lateral radiograph. 
• 
On the lateral radiograph, the aortic valve is centered on the plane drawn from the sternal/ diaphragmatic junction and the carina. The mitral valve is the most posterior valve. 

• 
The tricuspid valve is to the right and anterior to the mitral valve. 

• 
The pulmonic valve is the most superior and most leftward valve. 

• 
Evaluation of prosthetic valves can be challenging in patients with abnormal chamber enlargement or cardiac rotation. 

• 
The atrioventricular valves (mitral and tricuspid) are open in diastole. 



Imaging of other cardiac devices 
• Below are selective examples of common cardiac devices on chest radiographs. 

ICD-pacemaker combination: Chest radiograph shows an ICD and biventricular pacemaker combination with three leads. The combined ICD-pacemaker lead with shock coil terminates in the right ventricular apex (red arrow). The other pacemaker leads terminate in the right atrium (yellow arrow) and in the posterior or lateral cardiac vein (blue arrow).
