• The midgut normally herniates through the ventral anterior abdominal wall in the first trimester. During this abdominal wall herniation, the midgut rotates 270 degrees around the axis of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). 
midgut rotates midgut
• Physiologic midgut herniation is usually complete 270° counterclockwise around SMA 
by 12–13 weeks. Therefore, a pathologic ventral wall defect, such as omphalocele or gastroschisis, is

generally not diagnosed before 13 weeks. 
physiologic SMA 
• It is common to see some fullness at the base of 
midgutthe umbilical cord before 13 weeks, which usually herniation represents physiologic midgut herniation. If the fullness is especially prominent (=7 mm) then it may be prudent to bring the patient back for a follow-up at 13 weeks to evaluate for a true ventral wall defect. 
Normal early fetal anatomy (11–14 weeks) 
• At 11–14 weeks gestation, following structures should be assessed when possible: falx cerebri, stomach, bladder, ventral abdominal wall, and the presence of four extremities. 

Second and third trimesters 
Second and third trimester measurements 
Head measurements 
• The biparietal diameter (BPD) is measured from the outer edge of the skull closest to the transducer to the inner edge of the skull farthest from the transducer. 
The plane of measurement is at the level of the thalami and cavum septum pellucidum. The skull should 
be completely visualized all the way 
around. 
The corrected BPD incorporates the occipital frontal diameter (OFD) and a correction factor. The scanning plane for head measurements is at the level of

• 
The abdominal diameter is measured from outer skin-to-skin in AP and transverse at the level of the intrahepatic umbilical vein, portal vein, and fetal stomach. 

• 
Ideally, the abdomen should be round, with less than 1 cm difference between the AP and transverse measurements. The entire circumference of the skin should be well visualized. 

• 
The best measurements are often obtained if the anterior-posterior axis of the fetal abdomen is angled approximately 45 degrees so that the artifacts from the spine are minimized. 



The scanning plane for abdominal diameter is at 
the junction of the umbilical vein and portal vein (yellow arrow). The stomach (red arrow) should be visualized. Note how the anterior-posterior axis of the abdomen is angled approximately 45 degrees to minimize artifacts from the spine.

Femur length 
• The femur length is most accurately measured when the femur is closest to the transducer, perpendicular to the sound beam. 

Grayscale ultrasound demonstrating 
femur length measurement (calipers). 
Amniotic fluid assessment 
• 
The amount of amniotic fluid should always be subjectively assessed. There are three options for assessing amniotic fluid volume. 

1.
 Subjective assessment only. 

2.
 Deepest vertical pocket of fluid is measured in cm. 

3.
 Amniotic fluid index. 



• 
To quantify the amniotic fluid index (AFI) between 16–42 weeks, the largest vertical pocket of fluid is measured (in cm) in each of the four quadrants and summed. AFI varies with gestational age. In borderline cases, the subjective assessment should take precedent. Some references state that an AFI between 7 and 25 is normal, but these cutoffs vary. 


Oligohydramnios: AFI =6.3 cm is =2.5th percentile. Peaks at 24 weeks: 9.0 cm = 2.5th percentile. Polyhydramnios: AFI =19.2 cm is =97.5th percentile. Peaks at 36 weeks: 27.9 cm = 97.5th percentile. 
• 
A thickened nuchal fold is the most sensitive and specific ultrasound finding to suggest Down syndrome. 

• 
Compared to nuchal translucency, measurement of nuchal fold is performed later in pregnancy. The nuchal fold is 


measured in the axial plane at the level of 
the posterior fossa. 
• The nuchal fold is only measured from 16–20 


weeks. 
<5 mm is normal. 5–5.9 mm is borderline. 
=6 mm is a major marker for Trisomy 21. 
• A very thick nuchal fold may represent a 
cystic hygroma, which is associated with Turner syndrome (45,X). 



Evaluation of the cervix in second and third trimesters 
Cervical shortening 

Transvaginal grayscale ultrasound (left image) shows a shortened cervix (calipers) measuring 2.2 cm in length, with U-shaped funneling (yellow arrows). The right image is taken at a different time point during the same scan and shows false elongation of the cervix due to uterine contractions. Note cerclage wire with associated posterior acoustic shadowing (red arrows). 
• Shortening of the cervix is a risk factor for pre-term delivery. A cervical length <3 cm is abnormal. If there is any uncertainty about cervical length, a transvaginal ultrasound should be obtained. 
A potential pitfall is false elongation of the cervix due to distended bladder or uterine contractions. 
• The presence of cervical funneling (change in shape) is an ancillary finding. 
The mnemonic trust your vaginal ultrasound can be used to remember the sequence of cervical funneling. A T-shaped cervix is normal. As funneling progresses, the cervix resembles Y, V, and U shapes. 
• Prior to viability (24 weeks), treatment is cervical cerclage. After 24 weeks, treatment tends to be conservative (bedrest) due to concern for membrane rupture with any procedure. 

Umbilical cord 
• The normal umbilical cord has two umbilical arteries and a single umbilical vein. 

Grayscale ultrasound with Doppler overlay (left image) of the fetal pelvis demonstrates a three-vessel umbilical cord. Ultrasound of a different patient (right image) shows the normal appearance of the three-vessel cord on transverse view. Yellow arrows point to the two arteries, red arrow to the single vein. 
• 
Normal systolic/diastolic ratio of the umbilical artery waveform depends on the gestational age. Reference table should be consulted. 

• 
The umbilical artery should always have antegrade diastolic flow. Absent or reversed flow is a major indication of significant fetal stress. 


Two vessel umbilical cord (single umbilical artery) 
• 
A single umbilical artery is associated with an increased incidence of fetal anomalies and growth restriction. 

• 
There is an increased incidence of a single umbilical artery in trisomies 13 and 18. 



Grayscale ultrasound with Doppler overlay (left image) of the fetal abdomen demonstrates a single umbilical artery (yellow arrows). Transverse view of the umbilical cord (right image) shows two vessels. The red arrow 
points to the umbilical vein. 
Marginal/velamentous cord insertion 
• 
Marginal insertion is eccentric insertion of the umbilical cord at the margin of the placenta. 

• 
Velamentous insertion is when the umbilical cord inserts outside the margin of the placenta, into the free membranes where it is not protected by Wharton’s jelly. Velamentous cord insertion is at risk for vasa previa as subsequently described. 

• 
Vasa previa is the traversing of fetal placental vessels across the internal cervical os, which can be caused by velamentous insertion or a placental succenturiate lobe (discussed below). 



Vesa previa: Grayscale ultrasound (left image) in region of the fetal head and cervix demonstrates the position of the endocervical canal (yellow arrows). Although the grayscale image appeared normal, color Doppler shows a placental vessel (red arrow) traversing the internal cervical os. Spectral Doppler (not shown) confirmed presence of a fetal arterial vessel.

Amniotic fluid 
Overview of fetal amniotic fluid 
• 
Amniotic fluid surrounds the fetus and is required for normal development of multiple organ systems, including the lungs. 

• 
It is produced primarily by the fetal genitourinary tract and is excreted by the fetus as urine. A small amount is also produced by the fetal lungs and nasopharyngeal cavities. 

• 
Amniotic fluid is absorbed primarily by fetal swallowing and passage of fluid through the GI tract. 

• 
Assessment of amniotic fluid volume is discussed earlier in the chapter. 



Oligohydramnios 
• 
Oligohydramnios is too little amniotic fluid. 

• 
Most commonly, oligohydramnios is associated with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) without a fetal structural anomaly. 

• 
When severe, oligohydramnios results in pulmonary hypoplasia. It may also lead to Potter sequence, a constellation of findings including facial dysmorphism, club feet, and 


musculoskeletal contractures due to diminished intrauterine space. 
• Although malformations are relatively uncommon, the genitourinary system must be carefully evaluated in the setting of oligohydramnios. Genitourinary anomalies that may lead 
to oligohydramnios include: 
Renal agenesis – fatal if bilateral. Congenital bladder outlet obstruction, including posterior urethral valves. Bilateral ureteropelvic junction obstructions. Renal dysplasias, including autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). 
• 
Polyhydramnios is too much amniotic fluid. 

• 
Greater than half of cases of polyhydramnios are idiopathic, with a normal fetus. The remainder may be associated with chromosomal abnormalities, diabetes, or structural defects (primarily of the gastrointestinal tract), including: 


Primary upper GI obstruction or atresia, such as laryngeal, esophageal or duodenal atresia. Secondary obstruction, due to diaphragmatic hernia, gastroschisis, or omphalocele. Severe CNS anomalies (which often cause disorders in swallowing). Monochorionic twin syndromes, such as twin-twin transfusion syndrome (one twin polyhydramnios and 
one twin oligohydramnios). Placental abnormalities, such as chorioangioma. 


Placenta 
Placental embryology, physiology, and morphology 
• 
The placenta is formed by fetal chorion and maternal decidualized endometrium. 

• 
The mature placental circulation allows exchange of oxygen and nutrients between maternal and fetal vessels through a membrane, although the blood does not admix. 

• 
Placental location should be accessed in every patient. 

•A 
succenturiate lobe is an island of placental tissue separate from the main placenta, connected to the main placenta by blood vessels. Patients with succenturiate lobe have an increased incidence of velamentous cord insertion and retained products of conception. 



Placenta previa 
• Placental position is assessed starting in the second trimester. If there is uncertainty about placental position with relationship to the cervix, transvaginal evaluation should be 
performed. 
• 
Normal placental position is greater than 2 cm from the internal os. 

• 
Low-lying placenta is =2 cm from the internal os. Majority of low-lying placentas will resolve by the third trimester due to placental migration. 

• 
In placenta previa, the placenta covers the internal cervical os. Patients typically present with painless vaginal bleeding in the second trimester. Placenta previa is seen in approximately 0.5–1% of deliveries and requires a Caesarean section for safe delivery. 


A potential pitfall is over-diagnosis in the second trimester due to uterine contractions or overfilling of the 
maternal bladder. 

Placental abruption 
• Placental abruption is premature separation of the placenta from its uterine attachment. Patients most commonly present with pain. On physical exam, blood may be present in the 
vaginal canal. 
• 
There is an increased incidence of abruption in maternal hypertension, drug abuse, trauma, or rapid decompression of a distended uterus (e.g., from a large-volume amniocentesis). 

• 
Placental abruption can have variable ultrasound findings and may appear normal. Therefore, a negative ultrasound cannot exclude abruption. When visible, ultrasound shows a hematoma, which can be subchorionic (most commonly), retroplacental, or pre-placental. 

• 
Acute abruption may be especially challenging to diagnose on imaging as the hematoma is isoechoic to placenta. 



Acute retroplacental abruption: 
Ultrasound of the placenta shows a subtle, minimally hyperechoic retroplacental hematoma (arrows at placental/hematoma interface), nearly isoechoic to placenta. Acute retroplacental hematoma can be very difficult to identify. Realtime scanning or review of cine loops may be helpful. 
Case courtesy Julie Ritner, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• Chronic abruption features hypoechoic blood products within or around the placenta. 

Chronic abruption: 
Ultrasound of the placenta shows a heterogeneous, primarily hypoechoic preplacental hematoma (arrows), which lacks Doppler flow. 
Case courtesy Julie Ritner, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Placenta accreta spectrum is abnormally tenacious or deep attachment of the placenta into the myometrium, carrying a risk of hemorrhage at the time of placental separation. 

• 
Accreta is thought to be caused by uterine scarring (which may be secondary to prior Caesarean section, dilation and curettage, endometritis, or adenomyosis) and resultant endometrial deficiency. It is especially important to consider accreta if an anterior placenta is present with a history of prior Caesarean section. Other predisposing conditions include placenta previa, advanced maternal age, and multiparity. 

• 
Ultrasound findings of accreta include prominent irregular vascular lacunar spaces within the placenta and thinning or absence of the myometrium underlying the placenta. The presence of a moth-eaten placenta with vascular lacunar spaces near the bladder is highly specific for accreta. 

• 
Placenta accreta is an umbrella term that describes three degrees of placental attachment/ invasion. Confusingly, the term “placenta accreta” also describes one of the specific three 


degrees. 
• In placenta accreta, the placenta attaches deeply into the myometrium. Ultrasound shows 
thinning or absence of the normal hypoechoic subplacental myometrium. 
• 
In placenta increta, the placenta invades into the myometrium to the serosa. 

• 
In placenta percreta, placenta penetrates through the serosa to invade other structures. A focal bulge in the uterine wall is seen. 



Placenta percreta: Sagittal ultrasound of the uterus shows cystic spaces (yellow arrows) within the inferior placenta abutting the bladder, consistent with vascular lacunae. There is thinning of the myometrium at the placental/bladder interface (red arrows). 
Placental chorioangioma 
• 
Chorioangioma is the most common benign tumor of the placenta. 

• 
It is associated with hydrops, congenital abnormalities, hemolytic anemia, polyhydramnios, intrauterine growth restriction, and intrauterine fetal death. 

• 
On ultrasound, chorioangioma appears as a hypoechoic, rounded mass in the placenta with anechoic cystic areas and low resistance flow representing enlarged vascular channels. 




Fetal hydrops 
Overview of hydrops 

Fetal hydrops: 
Transverse ultrasound of a fetal head shows diffuse skin thickening of the scalp (arrows). Polyhydramnios 
is also present (although incompletely seen on this single image). 
Case courtesy Beryl Benacerraf, MD, Diagnostic 
Ultrasound Associates, Boston. 
• 
Hydrops is a fluid-overload state characterized by at least two of the following: ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, skin thickening, polyhydramnios, and placental enlargement. 

• 
Hydrops may be classified as immune or non-immune. Prognosis is variable but tends to be poor for non-immune hydrops. 



Immune hydrops 
• 
Immune-mediated hydrops is fetal hemolytic anemia caused by prior maternal exposure to fetal antigens, by far most commonly the Rh antigen. 

• 
Prognosis is good if treated with intrauterine or peripartum fetal blood transfusions. 



Non-immune hydrops 
• 
Non-immune hydrops can be due to a diverse array of causes, most of which lead to a common pathway of extracellular fluid overload. Prognosis of non-immune hydrops tends to be poor, as the primary cause is often not effectively treatable. 

• 
Common etiologies include: 


Cardiac arrhythmias. 
Extra-cardiac shunt, including vein of Galen malformation, hepatic hemangioendothelioma, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, and sacrococcygeal teratoma, all of which may lead to high-output cardiac failure. 
Infectious, especially Parvovirus B19 and TORCH infections, due to fetal aplastic anemia which is diagnosed by elevated middle cerebral artery velocity and treated with percutaneous fetal blood 
transfusions. Intrathoracic masses. 

Fetal ascites 
• 
When seen with other abnormalities, ascites is a criterion for diagnosis of hydrops. 

• 
Isolated fetal ascites may be due to urinary obstruction and resultant calyceal or bladder rupture, or bowel rupture and resultant meconium peritonitis. 



Fetal pleural effusion 
• 
Fetal pleural effusion (usually bilateral) is a criterion for diagnosis of hydrops. 

• 
When seen in isolation (not a component of hydrops or due to any other abnormality), fetal pleural effusion is most commonly a chylothorax. Fetal chylothorax is due to thoracic duct or lymphatic malformation. Prenatally and at birth the pleural fluid is clear, but after the baby begins to feed it becomes chylous (white-colored). 

• 
Fetal pleural effusions can also be seen in Noonan, Turner, or Down syndromes. 




Fetal brain 
Ventriculomegaly 
Anencephaly 

Transverse ultrasound of the fetal head shows severe symmetrical dilation of the lateral ventricles, with the calipers measuring 14 mm. Regardless of the gestational age, the lateral ventricles should always measure <10 mm. Note the dangling choroid (arrow). 
• Ventriculomegaly is enlargement of the cerebral ventricles. The term hydrocephalus is 
usually avoided because it implies ventriculomegaly due to obstruction. 
• Throughout gestation, the lateral ventricles should each measure less than 10 mm when measured at the atrium. The atrium is the confluence of the lateral ventricle, temporal horn, and occipital horn. The normal choroid plexus has a rounded border in this location. 
Mild ventriculomegaly: 10–12 mm; moderate: 12–15 mm; marked: >15 mm. 
• Normally, the choroid plexus fills the lateral ventricle. The dangling choroid sign represents 
the dependent drooping of choroid plexus seen in ventriculomegaly. Ventriculomegaly may be present even in a ventricle measuring <10 mm if there is >3 mm of fluid between 
the medial margin of the ventricle and the choroid. 
• Ventriculomegaly is a sign that something else is wrong, with a diverse array of etiologies: 
Primary CNS structural (aqueductal stenosis, Dandy Walker, Chiari II, holoprosencephaly, agenesis of the 
corpus callosum). Genetic (trisomies 13 and 18). Destructive (due to infection, hemorrhage, or infarct). 
Idiopathic. 

Anencephaly: 
Sagittal paramedian 17-week fetal ultrasound through the head and thorax shows lack of calvarium above the level 
of the orbits. Echogenic foci superior to the anencephalic head likely represent 
angiomatous stroma (arrow). 
Case courtesy Beryl Benacerraf, MD, 
Diagnostic Ultrasound Associates, Boston. 
• 
Anencephaly is a lethal anomaly with complete lack of development of the calvarium and destruction of the fetal cerebral cortex and calvarium above the orbits due to toxins in the amniotic fluid. Anencephaly may cause polyhydramnios due to impairment in swallowing. 

• 
AFP is elevated in anencephaly, due to direct exposure of neural tissue to the amniotic fluid. 

• 
Angiomatous stroma is residual neural-type tissue that may be tethered above the head and may be confused with an encephalocele. 

• 
The differential of anencephaly is amniotic band syndrome, which is typically asymmetric. 

•A 
cephalocele is a midline neural tube defect characterized by protrusion of intracranial structures outside of the calvarium. The occipital skull is the most common location. 

•A 
meningocele contains only meninges. An encephalocele also contains neural tissue. 

• 
In addition to cephalocele, the primary differential consideration of a mass posterior to the occipital skull is a cystic hygroma, which is a congenital lymphatic malformation and the 


most common fetal neck mass. 

Dandy Walker malformation 
• 
Dandy Walker is a diverse spectrum of diseases characterized by hypogenesis of the cerebellar vermis and resultant fourth ventricular dilation. 

• 
Dandy Walker is associated with agenesis of the corpus callosum. 

• 
Differential diagnosis includes Blake’s pouch cyst (embryological structure contiguous with the fourth ventricle that fails to regress) and mega cisterna magna (delayed fenestration of Blake’s pouch) which are risk factors for associated anomalies but when isolated have an excellent prognosis, unlike Dandy Walker malformation and vermian hypoplasia. 


Chiari II / Myelomeningocele 
• 
Chiari II is the combination of a small posterior fossa and a neural tube defect. By far the most common associated neural tube defect is a lumbar myelomeningocele. A myelomeningocele contains both neural elements and meninges. 

• 
The banana sign describes the characteristic flattened cerebellar hemispheres in the small posterior fossa. The banana sign is very specific for Chiari II. 

• 
The lemon sign describes flattening of the frontal bones, causing the calvarium to have the morphology of a lemon when seen axially. Unlike the banana sign, the lemon sign is not specific for Chiari II. 

• 
A myelomeningocele may be difficult to visualize by ultrasound but is presumed to be present if the brain is abnormal, as the brain abnormalities are more easily appreciated 


sonographically. 


Fetal ultrasound through the brain and posterior fossa demonstrates the banana and lemon signs. There is flattening of the frontal bones (lemon sign, yellow arrows) and flattening of the cerebellar hemispheres (banana sign, red arrows). Although the lemon sign is nonspecific, the banana sign is very specific for Chiari II. 
Case courtesy Beryl Benacerraf, MD, Diagnostic Ultrasound Associates, Boston. 
• 
Holoprosencephaly is failure of midline cleavage of the primitive prosencephalon in early embryologic development. The most severe form, alobar holoprosencephaly, leads to fused thalami and a single monoventricle that may communicate with a large dorsal cyst. Brain tissue surrounds the monoventricle, forming a characteristic boomerang shape. 

• 
Holoprosencephaly is associated with trisomy 13, facial hypoplasias, and midline facial anomalies including clefts, hypotelorism/cyclopia, absent nose and proboscis. 



Oblique axial/coronal ultrasound through the posterior brain shows fused thalami across the midline (arrows). A large dorsal cyst is present, largely replacing the visualized supratentorial brain. No falx is 
seen. 
Case courtesy Beryl Benacerraf, MD, 
Diagnostic Ultrasound Associates, Boston. 

Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) 
• 
Normal corpus callosum forms by 20 weeks gestational age from the body to the splenium. The rostrum forms last. 

• 
Absence of the corpus callosum (ACC) can be a difficult diagnosis to make prenatally. 

• 
Because the normal corpus callosum is not always visualized on ultrasound, it is often necessary to rely on secondary abnormal morphology of the ventricular system to diagnose absence of the corpus callosum. 


Absence of the cavum septum pellucidum is associated with ACC. 
Abnormal teardrop morphology of the lateral ventricles with dilated occipital horns, known as colpocephaly, is associated with ACC. Colpocephaly is often seen together with ventriculomegaly. Widely separated ventricular frontal horns and parallel configuration of the lateral ventricles both 
suggest ACC. This is sometimes referred as the steer horn or Viking helmet configuration. A midline interhemispheric cyst may be present, representing superior herniation of the third ventricle. 
• A minority of fetuses with agenesis of the corpus callosum have trisomy 8, 13, or 18. 

Transverse ultrasound through the fetal 
head shows ventriculomegaly and a colpocephalic configuration of the lateral ventricle with a dilated teardrop-shaped 
occipital horn (calipers). The ventricle is 
oriented parallel to the falx. 
Case courtesy Beryl Benacerraf, MD, 
Diagnostic Ultrasound Associates, Boston. 
• 
The cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) should always be identified in a normal fetus. 

• 
If the CSP is not seen, the primary consideration is agenesis of the corpus callosum, as the cavum septum pellucidum and corpus callosum are formed simultaneously. 

• 
Uncommonly, the CSP may be absent in the presence of a normal corpus callosum. This may represent septo-optic dysplasia and fetal MRI should be recommended. 


Hydranencephaly 
• Hydranencephaly is complete cortical destruction due to infarct or infection. The brain parenchyma is obliterated and replaced by fluid. In most instances, this finding follows a 
previously normal fetal survey. 
• The most common cause of hydranencephaly is in utero complete occlusion of both internal 
carotid arteries. 
• 
In contrast to severe hydrocephalus, a cortical mantle is absent in hydranencephaly. 

• 
In contrast to holoprosencephaly, a falx is typically visualized in hydranencephaly because it is supplied by the external carotid artery. 



Choroid plexus cyst 

Transverse ultrasound of a fetal head shows a hypoechoic cyst (arrow) located within the echogenic, otherwise normal-appearing choroid. 
• Cysts within the choroid plexus are common. The vast majority of choroid plexus cysts are present in normal fetuses and resolve on follow-up scans. However, choroid plexus cysts are 
a hallmark of trisomy 18. 
• 
Choroid plexus cysts can be considered an incidental finding in the absence of any other sonographic abnormality and with a normal maternal serum screen. 

• 
A choroid plexus cyst appears on ultrasound as a discrete and round hypoechoic to anechoic lesion within the choroid plexus that is visible in two planes, and measures =3 mm in size. 

• 
A potential mimicker of a choroid plexus cyst is the spongy choroid, which describes a heterogeneous echogenic choroid that is a normal variant. 


Vein of Galen malformation 

Color Doppler ultrasound of the fetal head shows an enlarged midline vascular structure representing a vein of Galen malformation. 
Case courtesy Beryl Benacerraf, MD, Diagnostic 
Ultrasound Associates, Boston. 
• 
Vein of Galen malformation is dilation of the vein of Galen (in the pineal region) caused by an arteriovenous fistula. 

• 
Vein of Galen aneurysm is a shunt lesion which may cause high-output cardiac failure, leading to hydrops. 





Fetal spine 
Evaluation of the fetal spine 
• In the normal fetal spine, three primary ossification centers are seen on transverse axial plane for each vertebra, one for the vertebral body (centrum) and one on either side for the 
posterior elements (neural arch). 
• It is important to examine the entire spine, especially the caudal end, to assess for neural tube defects. The spinal level can be determined by identifying the last ossified vertebra (presumed to be S4 in the second trimester, and S5 in the third trimester). 

Transverse ultrasound through the fetal abdomen at level of the stomach (ST) shows the normal three ossification centers of the vertebra (yellow arrows). Sagittal ultrasound shows the normal fetal spine as two parallel echogenic lines (yellow arrows) that converge at the sacrum (red arrow). It is important to assess the 
integrity of the skin overlying the spine. “BL” denotes the bladder. 

Spina dysraphism / Myelomeningocele 
• Spinal dysraphism is a spectrum of congenital anomalies due to incomplete closure of the 
neural tube. When this results in a defect in the posterior neural arch, the term spina bifida 
is used. 
• 
Meninges and neural tissue can protrude through the dorsal defect, resulting in meningocele (meninges only) and myelomeningocele (both meninges and neural tissue). 

• 
Myelomeningocele is more common than meningocele and occurs most often in the lumbar spine, followed by the cervical spine. Determination of the spinal level is useful for outcome 


counseling. 
• 
Imaging shows a cystic lesion protruding from the spinal canal at the midline back, with associated splaying of the vertebral pedicles/laminae and a dorsal skin defect. 

• 
Other types of spinal dysraphism are discussed in the “Spine” chapter. 



Sagittal ultrasound of the fetal torso and lumbosacral spine shows a large, heterogeneous, solid and cystic mass (arrows) arising from the sacrum/ coccyx. 
In contrast to myelomeningocele, 
the lumbosacral spine demonstrates normal tapering and the overlying skin is intact. 
Case courtesy Beryl Benacerraf, MD, 
Diagnostic Ultrasound Associates, 
Boston. 
• 
Sacrococcygeal teratoma is a germ cell tumor of the sacrum. It often presents prenatally as a mixed solid and cystic complex mass. 

• 
Sacrococcygeal teratoma may be associated with high output cardiac failure. 

• 
The other primary differential consideration for a distal fetal spinal mass is a myelomeningocele (Chiari II). Assessing the brain will be useful as it is always abnormal with a myelomeningocele and normal with a sacrococcygeal teratoma. 




Fetal face 
Evaluation of the fetal face 
• The fetal face should be examined for the presence of two orbits, normal nose and lips, nasal bone and a normal sized chin on sagittal profile view. 
Absent nasal bone 

Sagittal ultrasound of the fetal profile showing normal nasal bone in one fetus (left image) and absence of the nasal bone in a different fetus (right image; arrows). 
• A hypoplastic or absent nasal bone is associated with trisomy 21 if seen on first trimester ultrasound, and with aneuploidy if seen on second or third trimester ultrasound in patients with other markers of aneuploidy. 
Cleft lip and palate 
• 
Facial clefts are associated with aneuploidy (including trisomies 13 and 18), cardiac and CNS anomalies, or less commonly present as an isolated finding. Discovery of a facial cleft should therefore prompt a search for additional structural abnormalities. 

• 
On imaging, a linear defect is seen extending from the lip to the nostril (cleft lip), and may further extend through the alveolar ridge and palate (cleft lip and palate). The defect may be 


unilateral or bilateral. 
• 
Large facial clefts may affect fetal swallowing and lead to polyhydramnios. 

• 
Micrognathia is hypoplasia of the mandible, resulting in a small chin. It can be an isolated finding or associated with other anomalies (e.g., trisomy 18) or syndromes. 

• 
Severe micrognathia can impair fetal swallowing (leading to polyhydramnios), cause airway obstruction after birth (due to crowding of tongue in a small oral cavity) and difficulty in 


postnatal feeding. 




Fetal thorax 
Evaluation of the fetal thorax 
• Abnormal position of the heart in the thorax is an important clue to the possible presence of a thoracic anomaly. Abnormal cardiac position or axis may be secondary to a thoracic mass 
lesion or unilateral pulmonary agenesis. 

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) 

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia: 
Grayscale transverse ultrasound through the fetal thorax demonstrates rightward displacement of the heart (yellow arrows) due to herniation of intra-abdominal content into the left hemithorax, including the stomach (red arrow). 
• Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is herniation of abdominal organs (most commonly bowel) into the thorax through a diaphragmatic defect. CDH is the most common cause of a 
fetal intrathoracic mass lesion. 
• 
Most cases are isolated, although  a prominent minority of fetuses have other anomalies, most commonly congenital heart disease. 

• 
By far the most common location for CDH is the left posterior thorax, termed a Bochdalek hernia (mnemonic: “back to the left”). A Bochdalek hernia frequently displaces the heart to 


the right. 
• 
When a CDH occurs on the right it is termed a Morgagni hernia. The diaphragmatic defect of a Morgagni hernia tends to be anterior, with the liver the most commonly herniated organ. 

• 
The two classic prenatal findings of CDH are a cystic intrathoracic mass representing the stomach and/or bowel and nonvisualization of the stomach below the diaphragm. 

• 
Complications of CHD include pulmonary hypoplasia, bowel obstruction with resultant polyhydramnios, and obstruction of venous return due to IVC compression, which may lead 


to ascites. 

Bronchopulmonary foregut malformation 
• 
Bronchopulmonary foregut malformations are a spectrum of congenital abnormalities of the fetal lungs and upper GI tract. 

• 
Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) is a hamartomatous proliferation of small airways which communicates with the bronchial tree. Blood supply is from the pulmonary circulation. CPAM was previously called congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM). 


CPAM can be classified into three types based on the size of cysts (Type I – large cysts; Type II – small cysts; Type III – tiny cysts too small to see on ultrasound). Today this classification is not used much anymore as prognosis is dependent on size of the entire lesion rather than the size of the individual cysts. 
CPAM is not associated with other anomalies (unlike CDH). Many CPAM decrease in size and may disappear on ultrasound, but remain apparent on CT or MRI. 

Transverse ultrasound through the fetal 
thorax shows a large echogenic mass (calipers) containing small cystic spaces in left hemithorax, displacing the heart to the right. This was found to be a CPAM following surgical resection. 
• Sequestration is aberrant lung tissue with a systemic blood supply, usually from the aorta. The most characteristic location of sequestration is the left lower lobe. 
Classic ultrasound appearance of sequestration is an echogenic mass at the left lung base. The sequestration may occasionally be subdiaphragmatic and simulate an adrenal mass. Systemic blood supply should be confirmed with color Doppler. In the absence of the Doppler findings, 
sequestration may be difficult to differentiate from CPAM. In contrast to the findings of CPAM, cysts are less common, there is less mass effect, and location is almost always in the lower lobes. 
• 
Combination or hybrid CPAM/sequestration lesions are common at pathology. 

• 
Bronchogenic, gastrointestinal duplication, and neurenteric cysts almost always appear as solitary, simple cysts in the thoracic cavity on ultrasound. 

• 
Pulmonary hypoplasia is inadequate lung development. Hypoplasia can be due to a thoracic mass lesion (such as CDH), oligohydramnios, or a skeletal dysplasia affecting the ribs. 

• 
It is important to evaluate the size of the fetal thorax in relation to the abdomen on coronal images. A small, bell-shaped fetal thorax suggests pulmonary hypoplasia. The normal heart appears enlarged relative to the small thorax. 


Laryngeal or tracheal atresia 
• Atresia of the upper airway, otherwise known as congenital high airway obstruction syndrome (CHAOS), is lethal and may cause bilateral enlarged echogenic lungs. 

Transverse and sagittal ultrasound through the fetal thorax demonstrates symmetrically enlarged echogenic lungs (yellow arrows) flattening and inverting the hemidiaphragms (red arrows). There is large volume abdominal ascites, moderate polyhydramnios, and distended trachea and mainstem bronchi (not shown). Etiology was thought to be laryngeal web versus agenesis. 


Fetal heart 
Evaluation of the fetal heart 
• 
When congenital heart disease (CHD) is identified on prenatal ultrasound, genetic analysis is always indicated because of the high association with aneuploidy. 

• 
CHD is discussed in more detail under the “Pediatrics” chapter. 

• 
Sonographic assessment of the fetal heart should include the following: Four-chamber (4CH) view. Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). Right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). Three-vessel view, which depicts the main pulmonary artery-ductus arteriosus confluence, aortic arch, 


and SVC in one plane. 
Aortic arch, SVC, and IVC. 


Four normal sonographic views of the fetal heart: 
The morphologic right ventricle (RV) is characterized by the moderator band (which extends from the interventricular septum to the RV side wall) and tricuspid valve septal leaflet (which inserts onto 
the septum more anteriorly). 
LV = left ventricle. LA = left atrium. RA = right atrium. Ao = ascending aorta. DA = descending aorta. PA = main pulmonary artery. RPA and LPA = right and left pulmonary arteries. 
Ventricular septal defect (VSD) 
• Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most common CHD. It may be isolated or associated 
with other structural cardiac anomalies. 
• VSD is identified on prenatal ultrasound as a defect in the interventricular septum, best seen on four-chamber view, with bidirectional flow across the defect on color Doppler imaging. 


Atrioventricular septal defect 

Transverse ultrasound through the fetal thorax shows a central hole (*) within the heart, consistent with an atrioventricular septal defect. 
• 
Atrioventricular (AV) septal defect, also called endocardial cushion defect or AV canal defect, represents a spectrum of CHD resulting from deficiency in the AV junction. It is strongly associated with Down syndrome. 

• 
Four-chamber view shows absent AV septum and a single common AV valve, resulting in the appearance of a central hole in the heart when the valve opens during diastole. 



Transverse ultrasound through the fetal heart 
demonstrates an overriding, dilated aorta (Ao) and a subaortic VSD (arrow). 
• Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is characterized by a VSD, an overriding aorta, and a hypoplastic RVOT. The fourth component of the tetralogy, right ventricular hypertrophy, occurs 
postnatally. 
• Fetal ultrasound shows the aorta overriding both ventricles and a subaortic VSD. The main pulmonary artery is usually small in caliber while the ascending aorta is dilated. 
Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) 
• 
Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) has a classic appearance on prenatal ultrasound. 

• 
The ventricular outflow tract views show parallel orientation of the pulmonary trunk and ascending aorta, which normally cross at 90 degrees to each other. 

• 
The three-vessel view shows only two vessels, the aorta and SVC. The 4-chamber view can be normal. 

• 
TGA may or may not have an associated VSD. 





Fetal abdomen 
• Anomalies of the fetal gastrointestinal tract may cause polyhydramnios due to disruption of swallowing or impaired absorption of swallowed amniotic fluid if the anomaly is proximal. The amniotic fluid volume is typically normal in abnormalities of the mid or distal GI tract. 
Esophageal atresia 
• 
Esophageal atresia is a blind-ending esophagus, due to incomplete division of the foregut in early embryologic development. 

• 
Esophageal atresia is usually associated with a tracheoesophageal fistula. 

• 
The classic ultrasound findings of esophageal atresia are polyhydramnios and an absent stomach bubble. 


Duodenal atresia (DA) 

Two transverse ultrasound images through the fetal abdomen (left image) show the dilated stomach (st) and dilated proximal duodenum (duo) representing the double bubble sign. The image on the right confirms that these two dilated structures connect (arrow).

• 
Duodenal atresia (DA) causes duodenal obstruction from lack of recanalization of the duodenal lumen. Duodenal atresia is the most common cause of fetal duodenal obstruction. 

• 
DA has a strong association with Down syndrome. If a double bubble sign is seen, a careful screen for additional findings of Down syndrome should be performed (e.g., thorough cardiac exam, nuchal fold if 16–20 weeks, etc). 

• 
The classic appearance of DA is the double bubble sign, representing a dilated stomach and dilated proximal duodenum. The differential diagnosis of the double bubble sign includes duodenal web, stenosis, and annular pancreas. 


Distal fetal bowel obstruction 
• 
A distal fetal bowel obstruction may be structural or functional. 

• 
Structural causes of distal bowel obstruction include jejunal atresia, ileal atresia, and anorectal malformation. 


Anorectal malformation is commonly associated with additional abnormalities, including the VACTERL association (vertebral, anorectal, cardiac, tracheoesophageal, renal, and limb anomalies). 
• Functional bowel obstruction may be due to Hirschsprung disease or meconium ileus. Hirschsprung disease results in a functional obstruction due to absent distal enteric ganglion cells. Meconium ileus causes obstruction from impaction of meconium in the ileum. Nearly all infants with 
meconium ileus have cystic fibrosis; however, meconium ileus is rarely identified before the third 
trimester. 
• 
Meconium ileus is bowel obstruction caused by impacted meconium in a fetus with cystic fibrosis. 

• 
Meconium peritonitis is peritoneal inflammation secondary to in utero bowel perforation (due to atresia or unknown cause) and resultant spillage of meconium into the peritoneal cavity. This leads to chemical peritonitis with ascites, peritoneal adhesions and, ultimately, dystrophic calcifications. 

• 
Meconium pseudocyst is a cystic abdominal structure, often with peripheral calcification, representing a walled-off bowel perforation. It is a sequela of meconium peritonitis. 


Hyperechoic small bowel 
• 
Hyperechoic or echogenic bowel is a nonspecific finding that is associated with Down syndrome, TORCH infection, cystic fibrosis, and swallowing of blood products in the amniotic fluid. It may also be associated with intrauterine growth restriction. 

• 
If the bowel is only mildly echogenic (less echogenic than bone) and no mass effect is present, this appearance may represent a normal variant. 


Omphalocele: Transverse ultrasound through 
the fetal abdomen shows herniation of intra-abdominal content including the stomach (yellow arrow) outside of the anterior abdominal wall, covered by a peritoneal membrane (red arrows). The umbilical cord (blue arrow) inserts onto the 
herniated sac. 

• Omphalocele, the most common anterior abdominal wall defect, is a midline defect with herniation of intra-abdominal contents resulting from disruption of the normal physiologic first trimester bowel herniation process. The herniated bowel is covered by a peritoneal 
membrane. 
• 
The key to differentiate omphalocele from gastroschisis is the umbilical cord insertion site. In omphalocele, the umbilical cord inserts centrally at the base of the herniated sac. 

• 
When small, omphaloceles may contain only bowel. Larger omphaloceles may also contain liver. The presence of liver in the omphalocele carries a better prognosis. 

• 
Omphalocele is associated with other anomalies in 50–75% of cases, including cardiac anomalies, trisomies, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (a congenital overgrowth syndrome characterized by omphalocele, macroglossia, hemihypertrophy, and 


visceromegaly). Associated anomalies and aneuploidy are more likely if liver is not involved. 

Gastroschisis 
Gastroschisis: Transverse ultrasound through the fetal abdomen shows loops of bowel herniating outside of the anterior abdominal wall (yellow arrows), lateral to the normal midline cord insertion (red arrow). The bowel loops have a lobulated 
contour because there is no peritoneal covering. 

• 
Gastroschisis is a paraumbilical (usually right-sided) anterior abdominal wall defect, through which bowel herniates without a peritoneal covering. Gastroschisis is the second most common abdominal wall defect. 

• 
Unlike omphalocele, gastroschisis is usually seen as an isolated anomaly. 

• 
Gastroschisis is seen more commonly in very young (teenage) mothers and smokers, possibly related to a vascular insult. 

• 
Prognosis is dependent on the degree of bowel injury. 


Pentalogy of Cantrell 
• Pentalogy of Cantrell is a rare disorder consisting of ectopia cordis (extra-thoracic heart), omphalocele, diaphragmatic defect, pericardial defect, and disruption of the sternum. 


Fetal genitourinary 
• 
Although oligohydramnios may be due to many causes, the complete genitourinary (GU) tract (kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra) should be carefully evaluated in every fetus with oligohydramnios. 

• 
Oligohydramnios due to a fetal GU malformation can be divided into three categories: Fetal hydronephrosis (obstructive uropathy). Cystic renal disease. 


Bilateral renal agenesis. 
• If the fetal bladder is not visualized (an empty bladder is not visible on ultrasound) the cause 
of oligohydramnios is likely a renal anomaly, such as: Bilateral multicystic dysplastic kidneys. 
Bilateral renal agenesis. 
Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). 
• Normal fetal kidneys grow approximately 1 mm per week of gestation. For instance, a 20-week fetus should have kidneys approximately 2 cm in length. 
Fetal hydronephrosis overview 

Coronal fetal ultrasound shows bilateral hydronephrosis, severe on the right (arrows). This fetus has trisomy 18, which is associated with 
hydronephrosis. 
Case courtesy Beryl Benacerraf, MD, Diagnostic 
Ultrasound Associates, Boston. 
• Screening for fetal hydronephrosis is routinely performed to evaluate for potentially treatable causes, such as obstruction or reflux, which may lead to progressive childhood 
kidney damage if undiagnosed. 
• 
The anterior-posterior renal pelvis diameter (APRPD) is measured to assess for hydronephrosis. The accepted range of normal depends on gestational age. Less than 4 mm is always normal. 

• 
Below is the 2014 consensus on classification of prenatal urinary tract dilation (UTD classification system): 


Normal: APRPD <4 mm less than 28 weeks; <7 mm at or after 28 weeks. Possibly abnormal: 4 to <7 mm less than 28 weeks; 7 to <10 mm at or after 28 weeks. Abnormal**: =7 mm less than 28 weeks; =10 mm at or after 28 weeks. **Any of the following is also considered abnormal, independent of the APRPD: peripheral calyceal 
dilation, abnormal renal parenchymal thickness or appearance, dilated ureter, abnormal bladder, 
oligohydramnios thought to be due to an urinary cause. These features should be assessed in every fetus. 
• Hydronephrosis, hydroureter, and a normal bladder may be due to distal ureteral obstruction or reflux. Distal ureteral obstruction from ectopic insertion of the ureter into the bladder is often associated with 
the upper pole moiety of a duplicated collecting system. The most common ectopic insertion of an upper pole moiety is inferior and medial to the normally inserting lower pole ureter. A ureterocele is dilation of the intramural portion of the ureter, which balloons out into the bladder 
and causes a functional obstruction at the ureterovesicular junction. Ureterocele is also associated with 
ectopic insertion of the upper pole moiety of a duplicated system. Although not a physical obstruction, severe vesicoureteral reflux may cause hydronephrosis and hydroureter, but the bladder remains normal. 
• 
Bladder outlet obstruction leads to hydronephrosis, hydroureter, and a dilated bladder. Posterior urethral valves are by far the most common cause of bladder outlet obstruction. Urethral atresia is a rare cause of bladder outlet obstruction. 

• 
Hydronephrosis can lead to cystic renal dysplasia (increased echogenicity and cortical thinning), a sign of irreversible renal damage. 


Posterior urethral valves 

Coronal ultrasound through the fetal abdomen (left image) demonstrates bilateral hydronephrosis. Transverse ultrasound through the fetal pelvis (right image) shows dilated bladder (BL) and posterior urethra (PU) in a keyhole morphology. There is associated severe oligohydramnios (not shown). 
• 
Posterior urethral valves are congenital obstructions of the posterior urethra due to a membranous flap in male fetuses. 

• 
Ultrasound findings show severe dilation of the posterior urethra resulting in the keyhole sign. The bladder is typically enlarged and thickened. Bilateral severe hydroureteronephrosis and oligohydramnios are usually present. 



Transverse ultrasound through the fetal abdomen 
at the level of the kidneys shows massively 
enlarged and echogenic kidneys (calipers). There is complete absence of surrounding 
amniotic fluid, consistent with severe oligohydramnios (not shown). 
• Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a congenital disorder of diffuse collecting tubule dilation, leading to innumerable tiny renal cysts which are too small to be 
resolved by sonography. 
• 
Ultrasound findings include very large and echogenic kidneys and severe oligohydramnios, caused by markedly reduced renal function. 

• 
Prognosis is poor. ARPKD is associated with pulmonary hypoplasia and Potter’s syndrome in utero, and with hepatic fibrosis if the baby survives infancy. 


Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) 

Transverse ultrasound through the fetal abdomen (left image) demonstrates bilateral enlarged and echogenic kidneys with multiple non-communicating cysts (arrows). On the right is a sagittal image of one of the kidneys. 
• 
Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is thought to be the end result of fetal obstructive uropathy. 

• 
If MCDK is unilateral and there are no associated abnormalities, the prognosis is excellent. MCDK is fatal if bilateral, however. 

• 
MCDK may affect only the upper pole of an obstructed duplicated system. 

• 
On imaging, multiple non-communicating cysts are interspersed with dysplastic renal parenchyma. In contrast to hydronephrosis, the cysts of MCDK do not connect to the collecting system. 

• 
The natural history of MCDK is gradual involution which can occur pre- or post-natally. 




Fetal musculoskeletal imaging 
Clubfoot 

Left image shows normal foot-ankle relationship on grayscale ultrasound. Right image demonstrates a plantar flexed right foot with the sole seen at the same plane as the lower leg, consistent with clubfoot. 
• 
The ankle-foot relationship should be assessed in every fetus. 

• 
Clubfoot (talipes equinovarus) is a congenital deformity of the ankle and foot in which the foot is fixed in plantar flexion, with the forefoot adducted and heel inverted. 

• 
Clubfoot may be isolated or part of a syndrome. The presence of other structural 


abnormalities in a fetus with clubfoot warrants workup for an underlying genetic disorder. 
• On ultrasound, the plantar surface of the foot is seen in the same plane as tibia and fibula. 
Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) 

Osteogenesis imperfecta (non-fatal type): Third-trimester fetal survey shows an abnormal kinking (arrow) of the femur 
from prior in utero fracture. 
Case courtesy Julie Ritner, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a spectrum of congenital bone anomalies characterized by multiple fractures due to abnormal type I collagen. There are several types of OI, with type 2 being lethal. Type 2 can be diagnosed in the second trimester, but types 1, 3, and 4 are not typically diagnosed until the third trimester. 

• 
OI causes severe shortening of the long bones (<3 SD below the mean). The long bones and ribs appear “wrinkled” due to multiple fractures. The thorax is usually small due to broken and structurally soft ribs. 

• 
Unlike thanatophoric dysplasia, bony mineralization is decreased. Decreased calvarial mineralization causes the entire brain (including the nearfield) to be unusually well visualized. 



Thanatophoric dysplasia 
• 
Thanatophoric dysplasia is a lethal skeletal dysplasia with characteristic telephone receiver femurs, severe limb shortening and bowing, and rib shortening. 

• 
Platyspondyly is characteristic, which is flattening of the ossified portions of the vertebral bodies. 

• 
The classic cloverleaf skull is caused by protrusion of the frontal and temporal lobes. 

• 
Bony mineralization is normal. 




Trisomies and syndromes 
• Fetal anomalies often occur in associations. For instance, omphalocele may be a sentinel finding that signifies the presence of trisomy 13, 18, or Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. If a sentinel finding is seen, a careful search should be performed for associated anomalies seen 
in trisomies and syndromes.

• Increase in nuchal fold (>6 mm), measured between weeks 15 and 21, is the single most 
sensitive and specific ultrasound finding for trisomy 21. 
• In contrast, nuchal translucency is measured earlier in the pregnancy (11–14) weeks, and is 
less specific for trisomy 21.

• Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a syndrome of overgrowth that carries an increased risk of childhood cancers. BWS is mostly sporadic, but 10–15% of cases follow an 
autosomal dominant inheritance. 
• BWS increases the risk of developing Wilms tumor (the most common tumor in BWS),
