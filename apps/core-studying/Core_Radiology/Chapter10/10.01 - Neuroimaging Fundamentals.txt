Neuroimaging fundamentals 
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces 
Intra-axial and extra-axial compartments 
• 
An intra-axial lesion is within the brain parenchyma itself, underneath the pial membrane. 

• 
An extra-axial lesion is external to the pial membrane. The meninges and CSF spaces are extra-axial. 

• 
The CSF spaces include the sulci, fissures, basal cisterns, and ventricles. 


Sulcal/fi ssural anatomy 
motor cortex sensory cortex (frontal lobe) 
(parietal lobe) 
tral sulcustral sulcus 

• 
The interhemispheric (medial longitudinal) fissure separates the two cerebral hemispheres and contains the falx cerebri. 

• 
The central sulcus separates the primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus of frontal lobe) from the primary somatosensory cortex (postcentral gyrus of parietal lobe). 

• 
To find the central sulcus on sagittal images, follow the cingulate sulcus posteriorly on a slightly off-midline image (left image above). The cingulate sulcus ascends as the marginal 


ramus (pars marginalis). Directly anterior to the marginal ramus is the paracentral lobule, 
which is the medial continuation of both the precentral and postcentral gyri. 
• 
On axial images near the vertex (right image above), multiple signs can be used to localize the central sulcus. The central sulcus forms an inverted omega (O) around the knob of the hand motor cortex. One sulcus anterior is the precentral sulcus, which intersects the superior frontal sulcus in an inverted T shape. One sulcus posterior is the marginal ramus, which opens to the interhemispheric fissure and forms a curly bracket "{" shape facing anteriorly. 

• 
The Sylvian fissure (lateral sulcus) separates the frontal and parietal lobes above from the temporal lobe below. The parts of these lobes that border the Sylvian fissure and cover the underlying insula are collectively termed the operculum. 

• 
The parieto-occipital sulcus/fissure separates the medial surfaces of the parietal lobe (precuneus) and occipital lobe (cuneus).

suprapineal recess chiasmatic (supraoptic) recess pineal recess infundibular recess 
cerebral aqueduct 
The massa intermedia, also called the interthalamic adhesion, is a gray and white matter structure that passes through the third ventricle to connect the bilateral thalami. 
• 
The ventricular system consists of two lateral ventricles that drain into the midline third and fourth ventricles. 

• 
The (interventricular) foramina of Monro connect the lateral ventricles with the third ventricle. 

• 
The cerebral aqueduct (of Sylvius) connects the third ventricle with the fourth ventricle. 

• 
The fourth ventricle conti nues inferiorly (at its ti p, called the obex) as the central canal of the spinal cord. 

• 
The fourth ventricle also drains into the basal cisterns via three foramina: Paired foramina of Luschka (lateral apertures). 


Single foramen of Magendie (median aperture). 
Cisternal anatomy 

• 
The basal or subarachnoid cisterns are CSF-filled spaces around the base of the brain and brainstem across which vessels and cranial nerves traverse. 

• 
The suprasellar (chiasmatic) cistern is a pentagonal space around the pituitary infundibulum that contains the circle of Willis and optic chiasm. 

• 
The perimesencephalic cisterns surround the midbrain, consisting of the interpeduncular, crural, ambient, and quadrigeminal cisterns. 


CSF dynamics 
• CSF is primarily produced by the choroid plexus, which is located in specific locations throughout the ventricular system: 
Body and temporal horn of each lateral ventricle. Roof of third ventricle. Roof of fourth ventricle. 
There is NO choroid plexus in the cerebral aqueduct or occipital or frontal horns of the lateral ventricles. 
• 
The ventricular volume is approximately 25 mL. The volume of the subarachnoid spaces is approximately 125 mL, for a total CSF volume of approximately 150 mL. 

• 
CSF production is 500 mL/day, which turns over the total CSF volume 3–4 times per day. 

• 
CSF circulates by bulk flow and pulsatile agitation (related to the cardiorespiratory cycle and visible by MRI techniques such as phase-contrast) down through ventricles, out into the 


basal cisterns, and then through the rest of the subarachnoid spaces. 
• CSF is absorbed primarily by the arachnoid granulations (leptomeningeal evaginations extending into the dural venous sinuses) and to a lesser extent by the lymphatic system. 



Hydrocephalus 
• Communicating hydrocephalus is ventricular enlargement due to an increase in CSF volume without an obstructing lesion within the ventricular system. Processes that obstruct arachnoid granulation reabsorption of CSF can cause communicating hydrocephalus, such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningitis, or leptomeningeal metastases. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a form of communicating hydrocephalus characterized by 
normal CSF pressure and the clinical triad of ataxia, incontinence, and dementia. Imaging typically shows ventriculomegaly, acute callosal angle (measured between the lateral ventricles on a coronal image at the posterior commissure), widened Sylvian fissures, and tight high convexity (crowding of gyri at the vertex). 
• Noncommunicating hydrocephalus is hydrocephalus due to an obstructing lesion within the ventricular system, such as a third ventricular colloid cyst, aqueductal stenosis, or a posterior fossa mass. 
• 
Obstructive hydrocephalus usually refers to noncommunicating hydrocephalus but can also include communicating hydrocephalus attributed to obstruction at the level of the subarachnoid spaces or arachnoid granulations. 

• 
Hydrocephalus ex vacuo refers to ventricular enlargement due to brain parenchymal volume loss. 



Cerebral edema 
• 
Brain swelling, due to various etiologies, within a closed skull reduces the volume of blood and/or CSF compartments (Monro-Kellie doctrine). 

• 
Edema within the brain can be caused by cell death, altered capillary permeability, or hemodynamic forces. 

• 
Compared to normal brain parenchyma, edematous brain appears hypoattenuating on CT and FLAIR hyperintense on MRI. 


Cytotoxic edema 
• 
Cytotoxic edema is cell swelling caused by damaged molecular sodium-potassium ATPase ion pumps, most commonly due to acute ischemia. Failure to maintain ion gradients results in cellular (true cytotoxic) edema, wherein fluid moves from the extracellular space into the intracellular space, followed by ionic edema, wherein fluid moves from the intravascular space into the extracellular space across an intact blood-brain barrier. 

• 
Both gray and white matter are affected. Cellular edema appears as abnormally restricted diffusion on MRI. Ionic edema appears as loss of gray-white differentiation on CT. 


Vasogenic edema 
• Blood-brain barrier breakdown results in vasogenic edema, wherein plasma protein-rich fluid moves from the intravascular space into the extracellular space due to increased 
capillary permeability. 
• 
The causes are diverse, including neoplasm, infection, inflammation, hemorrhage, subacute arterial infarct, and venous infarct. 

• 
White matter is primarily affected. MRI shows facilitated diffusion (increased diffusivity). CT shows accentuated gray-white differentiation. 


Interstitial edema 
• 
Increased ventricular pressure results in transependymal flow, wherein CSF moves from the intraventricular space into the brain extracellular space. 

• 
The most common cause is acute obstructive hydrocephalus. 

• 
Periventricular white matter is primarily affected.

cerebellar tonsillar herniation 
cerebellar tonsils displaced through foramen magnum 
• compression of medulla can be fatal 
• 
The total volume in the skull is fixed. Intracranial mass effect may lead to herniation of brain matter across a dural fold. 

• 
Herniation may be due to a mass lesion (such as a neoplasm or hematoma) or edema secondary to large stroke. Because the volume of the posterior fossa is especially limited, cerebellar infarcts are prone to herniation. 


Subfalcine herniation 
• 
Subfalcine herniation is seen when the cingulate gyrus slides underneath the falx cerebri. 

• 
Subfalcine herniation may rarely cause compression of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) against the falx, resulting in infarction. 

• 
Contralateral ventricular entrapment (focal hydrocephalus) may result from foramen of Monro obstruction. 


Transtentorial herniation 

Early uncal herniation: Axial FLAIR MRI shows a heterogeneous mass 
in the right temporal lobe (yellow arrows), 
with effacement of the right lateral ventricle temporal horn. The mass effect causes mild downward uncal herniation with flattening of 
the right cerebral peduncle (red arrow). 

Transtentorial herniation (continued) 
• 
Effacement of the perimesencephalic cisterns may be a sign of impending or actual transtentorial herniation. 

• 
Downward transtentorial herniation involves inferomedial displacement of the mesial 


temporal lobe (uncal herniation) or less commonly, inferior displacement of the thalamus and midbrain (central herniation) through the tentorial notch. 
The ipsilateral cranial nerve III (oculomotor nerve) may be compressed, leading to pupillary dilation and downward and out eye deviation. 
Compression of the ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery (PCA) may cause medial temporal/occipital lobe 
infarct. 
Small Duret hemorrhages within the medulla or brainstem are caused by shearing of perforating basilar artery branches due to downward force on the brainstem. 
Compression of the contralateral cerebral peduncle against the tentorial notch can cause a hemiparesis ipsilateral to the herniated side (Kernohan notch phenomenon). 
Central herniation causes progressive impairment of brainstem function such as coma, breathing 
abnormality, and posturing. 

Duret hemorrhage: Noncontrast CT shows a left subdural hematoma (*; left image) causing rightward midline shift (yellow arrow) and downward transtentorial herniation with effacement of the perimesencephalic cisterns (red arrows; right image), and associated Duret hemorrhages within the pons (blue arrows). 
• Upward (ascending) transtentorial herniation is superior displacement of the upper parts of 
the cerebellum due to posterior fossa mass effect. The main complication is obstructive hydrocephalus from aqueductal compression. 

Cerebellar tonsillar herniation 
• Tonsillar herniation refers to downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils through foramen magnum, preferably attributed to mass effect (rather than a normal variant or Chiari malformation where terms like tonsillar ectopia or low-lying tonsils are appropriately 
less alarming). 
• Subsequent compression of medullary respiratory centers is often fatal. 

Extracranial (transcalvarial) herniation 
• 
Extracranial herniation refers to shift of brain tissue outside of the brain case, typically at a surgical or traumatic calvarial defect and attributed to abnormal intracranial mass effect (rather than a malformation where the term encephalocele is more common). 

• 
Extracranial herniation is an expected feature following decompressive craniectomy. However, a mushroom-like appearance suggests the craniectomy defect is too small, potentially constricting vessels and brain tissue at the margins. 



Paradoxical herniation 
• Paradoxical brain herniation, also known as sunken/sinking skin flap syndrome, is a complication of large craniectomy where intracranial pressure falls below atmospheric pressure, resulting in concave deformity and progressive shift of the brain away from the calvarial defect. 


MRI in neuroradiology 
• As discussed in the physics chapter, inherent tissue signal characteristics depend on the longitudinal recovery/relaxation (T1) and transverse relaxation (T2) times of the protons in that tissue. 
T1 shortening is hyperintense (bright) on T1-weighted images and T1 prolongation is hypointense (dark). Conversely, T2 shortening is hypointense on T2-weighted images and T2 prolongation is hyperintense. 
Spin-echo T1-weighted imaging 
• 
Most brain lesions are hypointense on T1-weighted images due to pathologic prolongation of the longitudinal recovery. 

• 
The presence of hyperintensity on T1-weighted images (caused by T1 shortening) can be an 


important clue to specific substances: 
Fat. Proteinaceous material. Methemoglobin.  Melanin. Minerals: gadolinium, copper, manganese, iron, and calcium (rarely; when dispersed, not in bone).  

• Slow-flowing blood also appears hyperintense on T1-weighted spin-echo sequences, which have a short TR. This time-of-flight effect is called “flow-related enhancement.” 

Spin-echo T2-weighted imaging 
• 
Most brain lesions are hyperintense on T2-weighted images due to water content or edema causing T2 prolongation. 

• 
The presence of hypointensity on T2-weighted images (caused by T2 shortening) can be an 


important clue to specific substances: 
Most stages of blood (deoxyhemoglobin, intracellular methemoglobin, hemosiderin). Calcification. Fibrous tissue. 
Highly cellular tumors with a high nucleus:cytoplasm ratio producing low lesional water content (for 
instance, lymphoma and medulloblastoma). Desiccated secretions in the paranasal sinuses. 
• Fast-moving blood also appears hypointense on T2-weighted spin-echo sequences, which have a long TE. This time-of-flight effect is called a “flow-void.” 
Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) 
• 
FLAIR refers to the addition of an inversion pulse that nulls fluid signal (based on water’s T1 characteristics). 

• 
The T2-FLAIR sequence is the workhorse of neuroradiology. It is usually referred to simply as “FLAIR” even though the technique can apply to T1-weighted images as well. 

• 
While CSF is dark on both T2-FLAIR and T1-weighted images, they can be distinguished by 


looking at the relative signal intensities of the gray and white matter. T1: Normal white matter is hyperintense due to fatty myelinated white matter, with a short T1 time. T2-FLAIR: White matter is darker than gray matter. T2-FLAIR will be referred to as FLAIR in this chapter. 

Spin-echo proton density (PD)-weighted imaging 
• Proton density (PD) images are not used in many neuroradiology MRI protocols, but they do have the highest signal-to-noise ratio of any sequence. PD sequences may be useful in the evaluation of multiple sclerosis (MS), especially in the spinal cord. 

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) 
• 
DWI depicts Brownian motion of water protons. Signal is lost with increasing diffusion. Free water (CSF) experiences the most signal attenuation, while many pathologic processes (primarily ischemia) cause reduced diffusivity and less signal loss. 

• 
DWI is an inherently T2-weighted sequence with diffusion-sensitizing pulsed gradients applied sequentially in multiple directions. The b-value is the setting that determines the degree of diffusion weighting, which is based on the diffusion gradient amplitude, duration, and time interval between pulses. 


The higher the b-value, the more contrast the image will provide for detecting reduced diffusivity. The downside to increasing the b-value is a decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio, unless scan time is proportionally increased for additional acquisitions. 
• DWI is typically displayed in two ways, interpreted together: Trace images and ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) maps. 
Trace images are a summation of the source images sensitive to diffusion in different directions. Reduced diffusivity will be hyperintense and lesions are very conspicuous. The ADC map shows pure diffusion information without any T2 weighting, obtained by calculating the 
exponential decay constant when plotting the MR signal obtained with a set of at least two b-values. In 
contrast to DWI, reduced diffusivity is hypointense on the ADC map. Because readers are less sensitive to detecting reduced diffusivity using the ADC map alone, DWI is the primary sequence used to detect diffusion abnormalities. 
Whereas trace images show a scalar measure of diffusion, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) depicts directional asymmetries, called anisotropy, such as that inherent to white matter fiber tracts. 
• An important pitfall to be aware of is the phenomenon of T2 shine-through. Because DWI images are T2-weighted, lesions with long T2 relaxation times will also be hyperintense on DWI, particularly on low b-value images. True restricted diffusion will correlate with a 
corresponding area of hypointensity on the ADC map. 
• Restricted diffusion is best known in the setting of acute ischemic stroke, as DWI is sensitive for infarction within minutes of onset. However, the causes of reduced diffusion are diverse: 
Neoplastic: e.g., lymphoma, glioblastoma, medulloblastoma. Inflammatory: e.g., multiple sclerosis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Infectious: e.g., abscess, empyema, ventriculitis, herpes encephalitis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Vascular: e.g., arterial or venous infarction, global hypoxic-ischemic injury, posterior reversible 
encephalopathy syndrome. Toxic: e.g., carbon monoxide, methanol, ethylene glycol, Wernicke encephalopathy, chemotherapy. Metabolic: e.g., osmotic demyelination, hypoglycemic encephalopathy, hepatic encephalopathy. Congenital: e.g., epidermoid cyst, mitochondrial diseases. 
Traumatic: diffuse axonal injury, hematoma. Seizure (status epilepticus). Treatment: radiosurgery, antiangiogenic therapy. 

Gradient recalled echo (GRE) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) 
• 
T2*-weighted GRE sequences are susceptible to signal loss from field inhomogeneities because there is no 180° rephasing pulse as there is in spin-echo sequences. 

• 
SWI is a more sensitive version of GRE involving higher spatial resolution and other features to reduce artifacts. SWI generates both magnitude and phase images, which can help distinguish between paramagnetic (blood/iron) and diamagnetic (calcification) substances. 

• 
Due to the susceptibility effect, materials like hemosiderin and calcification create blooming artifacts of signal dropout, which makes even small lesions conspicuous. 

• 
The differential diagnosis of multiple dark spots on GRE/SWI reflects causes of microhemorrhage: 


Hypertensive microangiopathy (primarily in the basal ganglia, thalami, cerebellum, and pons). Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (primarily lobar in cortico-subcortical sites, sparing deep structures). Familial cerebral cavernous malformation syndrome (inherited multiple cavernous malformations). Radiation-induced cerebral vasculopathy. Diffuse axonal injury (primarily at gray-white matter junction and corpus callosum). 
Hemorrhagic metastases. Fat embolism. Complication of cardiac surgery (presumed to be rapidly developed microbleeds). 

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) 
• 
Proton MR spectroscopy describes the chemical composition of a brain region. The changes in brain metabolites can be used for diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment assessment of a variety of CNS disorders. 

• 
There are various methods of performing MR spectroscopy. Single-voxel spectroscopy (SVS) provides a high signal-to-noise ratio with a short scan time but only provides single­voxel coverage. Multi-voxel chemical shift imaging (CSI) is advantageous for larger or more heterogeneous lesions because it provides a larger coverage area and higher spatial resolution due to smaller size of individual voxels, with the tradeoff of longer scan time and lower signal-to-noise ratio. 

• 
The peaks of the main compounds analyzed occur in alphabetical order, displayed left to 


right on a reversed axis of resonance frequencies expressed in parts per million (ppm). Choline (3.2 ppm) is a marker of cell membrane turnover that increases in most abnormalities. Creatine (3.0 ppm) reflects cellular energy stores and is relatively constant between most disease states. N-acetylaspartate (NAA) (2.0 ppm) is a marker of neuronal viability that decreases in most abnormalities. Lipids and lactate (1.3 ppm) reflect abnormal tissue damage and anaerobic glycolysis, respectively. Lipids 
have a broad peak and lactate has a doublet peak (due to J-coupling). These may be difficult to distinguish, but the lactate doublet is inverted at intermediate TE (e.g., 144 ms). 
• 
Hunter’s angle is a quick way to see if a spectrum is normal: a line connecting the tallest normal peaks (choline, creatine, and NAA) should point up like a plane taking off. Most diseases feature decreased NAA and/or increased choline, disrupting Hunter’s angle. 

• 
MRS can help in the evaluation of brain tumors. Prominent lipid/lactate peaks are associated with high-grade gliomas (when nonenhancing) or lymphoma (when enhancing). Elevated choline suggests tumor rather than edema (in an area of nonenhancing FLAIR abnormality) or radiation-induced necrosis (in a contrast-enhancing area; i.e., progression rather than pseudoprogression). Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant status in gliomas, which carries favorable prognosis, may be predicted by the presence of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), but advanced MRS techniques are required to detect this metabolite. 


Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS; continued) 

Right panel: Abnormal spectrum due to oligoastrocytoma, with elevated choline and decreased NAA. A line connecting the tallest peaks (Hunter's angle, yellow line) would point down, which is a clue that the 
spectrum is abnormal. 
Left panel: Normal spectrum. Hunter’s angle is pointing up like a plane at takeoff. 
• MRS can help detect inborn errors of metabolism and mitochondrial disorders. Elevated NAA is characteristic of the leukodystrophy Canavan disease. Elevated lactate suggests mitochondrial encephalopathies such as Leigh syndrome. 

MR Perfusion 
• 
MR perfusion (sometimes called “perfusion-weighted imaging”) refers to a family of advanced techniques to detect changes in signal in the brain dependent on inflowing blood. 

• 
In dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MR perfusion, injection of a bolus of gadolinium-based contrast media causes a magnetic field disturbance, which transiently decreases the signal intensity on T2*-weighted images. 

• 
In dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MR perfusion, injection of a bolus of gadolinium-based contrast media causes T1 shortening, which increases the signal intensity on T1-weighted images. 

• 
In arterial spin labeling (ASL) MR perfusion, a noncontrast technique, radiofrequency pulses at the neck magnetically label blood protons, which then travel to the brain where they are 


imaged. 
• 
Three calculated parameters reflect microvascular effects (capillary perfusion): cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and mean transit time (MTT = CBV/CBF). 

• 
Additional parameters like time to maximum (Tmax) and time to peak concentration (TTP) also capture macrovascular effects such as contrast bolus arrival delay. 

• 
MR perfusion is most commonly employed for evaluation of brain tumors. High-grade gliomas and metastases have higher relative CBV compared to low-grade gliomas or lymphoma. In the post-treatment setting for high-grade gliomas, elevated CBV favors tumor recurrence over pseudoprogression. 

• 
In acute stroke, perfusion imaging identifies ischemic penumbra (area at risk of infarction) characterized by delayed contrast arrival (elevated Tmax) but compensated microvascular autoregulation (at most moderate decrease in CBF, mismatched by elevated CBV). 

• 
The above parameters and perfusion imaging are further discussed in the stroke section. 





Patterns of enhancement in the brain 
Blood-brain barrier (BBB) and enhancement 
• 
Micro or macro disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) produces parenchymal enhancement after contrast administration, which may be secondary to infection, inflammation, neoplasm, trauma, and vascular etiologies. 

• 
The BBB is formed by astrocytic foot processes of brain capillary endothelial cells and prevents direct communication between the systemic capillaries and the protected extracellular fluid of the brain. 

• 
Several CNS regions do not have a BBB, and therefore normally enhance: 


Choroid plexus. Pituitary and pineal glands. Tuber cinereum (controls circadian rhythm, located in the inferior hypothalamus). 
Area postrema (controls vomiting, located at inferior aspect of fourth ventricle). 
The dura also lacks a BBB, but does not normally enhance. This phenomenon is subsequently explained in 
the section on pachymeningeal (dural) enhancement. 
• Vascular enhancement is due to a localized increase in blood flow, which may be secondary 
to vasodilation, hyperemia, neovascularity, or arteriovenous shunting. On CT, the arterial phase of contrast enhancement (i.e., CT angiogram) mostly shows intravascular 
enhancement. Parenchymal enhancement, including the dural folds of the falx and tentorium, is best seen 
several minutes after the initial contrast bolus. On MRI, routine contrast-enhanced sequences are obtained in the parenchymal phase, several minutes after injection. Most intracranial vascular MRI imaging is performed with a noncontrast time-of-flight 
technique. 
• Intracranial enhancement may be intra- or extra-axial. Extra-axial structures that may enhance in pathologic conditions include the dura (pachymeninges) and arachnoid 
(leptomeninges). 

Periventricular enhancement (intra-axial) 

Axial post-contrast T1-weighted MRI demonstrates smooth periventricular 
enhancement (arrows) thought to represent 
ventriculitis/infectious ependymitis. This was proven to be an uncommon case of metastatic melanoma based on CSF sampling. 
• Enhancement of the subependymal cortical surface can be either neoplastic, infectious, demyelination, and treatment-induced (e.g., radiation). 
Nodular subcortical enhancement (intra-axial) 
• 
Nodular intra-axial enhancement is most commonly due to metastatic disease. 

• 
Hematogenously disseminated metastatic disease is commonly found at the subcortical gray-white junctions. Tumor emboli become “stuck” at the junction between the simple vasculature of the white matter and the highly branching vasculature of the gray matter. 


Nodular subcortical enhancement (intra-axial; continued) 
• Edema is almost always present with metastatic disease of the gray-white junction, although slightly more distal cortical metastases may not show any edema and may be detectable 
only on the post-contrast images. 
• In contrast to the subcortical pattern seen with arterial metastases, venous dissemination of metastasis (e.g., pelvic malignancy spread via the Batson prevertebral venous plexus) leads to posterior fossa disease by transit through the retroclival venous plexus. 
Gyriform enhancement (intra-axial) 

diff erential diagnosis of
gyriform enhancement 
Axial T1-weighted post-contrast MRI (left image) shows a focus of enhancement along the gyral surface of the left frontal lobe (arrow) in a pattern typical of gyriform enhancement. This region is hyperintense on the ADC map (arrow on right image), consistent with increased diffusivity. There is no significant mass effect. This was a 
late subacute infarct. 
• 
Superficial enhancement of the cortical (gyral) surface of the brain can be due to either cerebral infection, inflammation, or ischemia. 

• 
Herpes encephalitis is a serious necrotizing infection of the brain parenchyma due to reactivation of latent HSV-1 infection within the trigeminal ganglion. The medial temporal lobes and cingulate gyrus are usually affected first and demonstrate gyral enhancement due to inflammation, petechial hemorrhage, and resultant BBB breakdown. The involved areas typically also demonstrate reduced diffusivity. 

• 
Meningitis may cause gyral enhancement in addition to the leptomeningeal enhancement previously discussed. 


• Subacute infarct can demonstrate gyriform enhancement lasting approximately 6 days to 6 weeks after the initial ischemic event. In contrast to the gyriform enhancement of subacute infarct, an acute infarct may demonstrate vascular enhancement due to reactive collateral vasodilation and resultant hyperemia. Enhancement related to subacute infarct is often associated with varying degree of T1 shortening 
(hyperintensity) and this can be an important distinguishing feature in addition to volume loss that will take longer time to manifest. 
• 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a syndrome of vasogenic white matter edema triggered by altered autoregulation that may demonstrate gyral enhancement. PRES may rarely exhibit restricted diffusion. 

• 
SMART syndrome (stroke-like migraine attacks after radiation therapy) is a delayed complication of radiotherapy, usually occurring years or decades after treatment. It is characterized by contiguous cortical thickening, edema, gyriform DWI abnormality, and enhancement. It can progressively worsen over months, but eventually stabilizes. 


Ring enhancement (intra-axial) 

Patient 1: Axial post-contrast T1-weighted Patient 2: Axial post-contrast T1-weighted Patient 3: Axial post-contrast T1-weighted MRI shows a bilobed ring-enhancing MRI shows an irregular ring-enhancing MRI shows a ring-enhancing lesion in the lesion in the right frontal cortex. This was lesion effacing the atrium of the left left parietal lobe abutting the falx. This due to neurocysticercosis. ventricle and extending across the was a breast cancer metastasis. 
splenium of the corpus callosum (arrow). This was a glioblastoma. 
• 
Peripheral (ring) enhancement is a common presentation with a broad range of differential diagnoses. The two most common causes are high-grade neoplasm and cerebral abscess. 

• 
The mnemonic MAGIC DR (metastasis, abscess, glioma, infarct, contusion, demyelination, and radiation) may be helpful to remember the wide range of etiologies for ring enhancement, although it is usually possible to narrow the differential based on the pattern of ring enhancement combined with additional MRI sequences and clinical history. 

• 
Metastasis: Hematogenous metastases are typically found at the subcortical gray-white junction. Metastases are often multiple, but smaller lesions may not be ring-enhancing. 

• 
Abscess: A pyogenic abscess is formed as a result of organization and sequestration of an infection, featuring a central region of viscous necrosis. 


The key imaging findings of abscess are reduced diffusivity (bright on DWI and dark on ADC) caused by high viscosity of central necrosis and a characteristic smooth, hypointense rim on T2-weighted images. 
• Glioma: High grade tumors such as glioblastoma typically have a thick and irregular wall. Multivoxel MRI spectroscopy will be abnormal outside the margin of an enhancing high grade glial 
neoplasm secondary to nonenhancing infiltrative tumor. This is in contrast to demyelinating lesion, abscess, and metastasis, where the spectral pattern returns to normal at the margin of the lesion. Perfusion MRI demonstrates elevated perfusion in a high grade glioma. 
• Infarct: Although subacute infarcts often demonstrate gyral enhancement, ring 
enhancement can be seen in subacute basal ganglia infarcts. 
In contrast to neoplasm or infection, a subacute infarct does not have significant mass effect. 
• Contusion: Both traumatic and nontraumatic intraparenchymal hemorrhage can show ring 
enhancement in the subacute to chronic stage. 
• Demyelinating disease: The key finding in ring-enhancing demyelinating disease is lack of 
significant mass effect. The “ring” of enhancement is often incomplete and “C” shaped. Multiple sclerosis is the most common demyelinating disease. Enhancement suggests active disease. Although the typical finding is an incomplete rim of enhancement, tumefactive demyelinating disease can 
look identical to a high-grade tumor. 
• Radiation necrosis may look identical to a necrotic tumor such as high-grade tumor or metastasis. On perfusion, cerebral blood volume is generally low in radiation necrosis and 
typically increased in a high-grade glioma.

Pachymeningeal (dural) enhancement (extra-axial) 

Diffuse dural enhancement: Axial (left image) and coronal post-contrast T1-weighted (right image) MRI shows diffuse dural enhancement (arrows). This was a case of intracranial hypotension. 
• 
The pachymeninges (pachy means thick – a “thick-skinned” elephant is a pachyderm) refers to the dura mater, the thick and leather-like outermost covering of the brain. 

• 
In addition to surrounding the surface of the brain, the dura forms several reflections, including the falx, tentorium, and cavernous sinus. 

• 
The dura does not have a blood-brain barrier. Although contrast molecules normally diffuse into the dura on enhanced CT or MRI, dural enhancement is never visualized on CT and is only visualized on MRI in pathologic situations. 


Dural enhancement is not seen on CT because both the skull and adjacent enhancing dura appear white. Enhancement of normal dura is not visible on MRI because MRI visualization of enhancement requires both water protons and gadolinium. Although gadolinium is present in the dura, there are normally very few water protons. However, dural pathology often causes dural edema, which provides enough water protons to make the gadolinium visible. Therefore, dural enhancement on MRI is an indication of dural 
edema rather than BBB breakdown. 
• Intracranial hypotension: Prolonged decrease in CSF pressure can lead to vasogenic edema 
in the dura. 
Intracranial hypotension clinically presents as a postural headache exacerbated by standing upright. Etiology may be idiopathic or secondary to CSF leak whether spontaneous or iatrogenic. Imaging shows smooth, linear dural enhancement, enlargement of the pituitary gland and dural venous 
sinuses, and “sagging” of the cerebellar tonsils. There may also be subdural hemorrhage due to traction 
effect on the cerebral veins. 
• 
Postoperative: Dural enhancement may be seen postoperatively. 

• 
Post lumbar puncture: Diffuse dural enhancement is occasionally seen (<5% of the time) after routine lumbar puncture. 

• 
Meningeal neoplasm, such as meningioma, can produce a focal area of dural enhancement called a dural tail, due to reactive changes in the dura. Metastatic disease to the dura, most commonly breast cancer in a female and prostate cancer in a male, can cause irregular dural enhancement. 

• 
Hypertrophic pachymeningitis: localized or diffuse dural thickening due to various causes, including infectious (e.g., tuberculosis, fungal, syphilis), inflammatory (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis), sarcoidosis, or can be idiopathic.

Leptomeningeal (pia-arachnoid) enhancement (extra-axial) 


• 
The leptomeninges (lepto means thin or narrow) include the pia and arachnoid. 

• 
Leptomeningeal enhancement follows the undulating contours of the sulci as it includes enhancement of both the subarachnoid space and the pial surface of the brain. 


• Meningitis (either bacterial, viral, or fungal) is the primary consideration when 
diff erenti al diagnosis of
leptomeningeal enhancement
• • 
leptomeningeal enhancement is seen. 
Leptomeningeal enhancement in meningitis is caused by BBB breakdown due to inflammation or infection. Fine, linear enhancement suggests bacterial or viral meningitis. Thicker, nodular enhancement suggests fungal meningitis. Viral encephalitis may produce cranial nerve enhancement within the subarachnoid space. Leptomeningeal metastases, also called neoplastic meningitis, is spread of tumor cells into the subarachnoid space, which may be due to primary brain tumor or metastatic disease 
from an extra-CNS malignancy. 
CNS neoplasms that more commonly have leptomeningeal spread include medulloblastoma, choroid 
plexus tumor, lymphoma, ependymoma, glioblastoma, and germinoma. 
Metastatic tumors known to cause leptomeningeal disease include lymphoma and breast cancer. 
• Inflammatory amyloidosis often shows leptomeningeal enhancement with cortical edema and susceptibility. 
• The differential diagnosis of FLAIR hyperintensity in the subarachnoid space overlaps with the 
differential for leptomeningeal enhancement. Subarachnoid FLAIR hyperintensity may be due to: Meningitis and leptomeningeal metastases both have increased subarachnoid FLAIR signal and leptomeningeal 
enhancement. 
Subarachnoid hemorrhage manifests as increased subarachnoid FLAIR signal, without leptomeningeal enhancement. Blooming artifact on GRE or SWI from blood products will help differentiate subarachnoid 
hemorrhage from leptomeningeal metastases. Slow vascular flow appears as an intravascular distribution of FLAIR hyperintensity due to “unmasking” of the 
inherent high signal of blood, which remains in the plane of imaging as the entire pulse sequence is obtained. Slow flow of peripheral vessels in moyamoya disease causes the ivy sign. Subarachnoid FLAIR signal is artifactually increased when the patient is on oxygen or propofol therapy, without 
abnormal enhancement.
