Bacterial infection 
Pyogenic abscess 

Axial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI Axial T2-weighted MRI 

DWI ADC map Pyogenic abscess: A ring-enhancing lesion (arrow) in the right anterior temporal lobe features a thin, smoothly 
enhancing, hypointense rim on the T2-weighted image, with moderate surrounding vasogenic edema. The contents of the lesion are hyperintense on DWI and dark on ADC, consistent with restricted diffusion. 
• 
A cerebral pyogenic abscess may be due to hematogenous dissemination, direct spread from paranasal sinusitis or mastoiditis, or as a complication of bacterial meningitis. 

• 
An abscess evolves over 4 stages (early cerebritis g late cerebritis g early abscess g late abscess) and takes about two weeks to fully develop. In the early stage of infection, there is nonspecific T2 prolongation in the affected region, with heterogeneous enhancement. 

• 
After the abscess becomes discrete, the classic imaging appearance is a ring-enhancing mass. The rim is hypointense on T2-weighted images. Unlike the rim of a glioma or 


metastasis, an abscess rim is thin and smooth. 
• 
When periventricular in location, an abscess classically tends to feature a thinner capsule oriented towards the ventricles. Disruption of the ventricular margin may herald impending rupture. Rupture may result in ventriculitis, with very high mortality. 

• 
A brain abscess almost always demonstrates restricted diffusion, appearing very bright on DWI due to restricted diffusion superimposed on inherent hyperintensity on T2-weighted 


images. 
Tuberculoma 
• 
A tuberculoma is a localized tuberculosis granuloma. It is not always possible to differentiate a tuberculoma from a pyogenic abscess. 

• 
A tuberculoma tends to have central hypointensity on T2-weighted image (in contrast to a pyogenic abscess, which is hyperintense). A cystic tuberculoma, however, may mimic 


a pyogenic abscess. Similar to pyogenic abscess, tuberculomas tend to show restricted 
diffusion. 

Lyme disease 
• Lyme disease, caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, can cause white matter disease with a nonspecific imaging appearance of T2 prolongation predominantly in the frontal subcortical white matter. Associated enhancement of multiple cranial nerves or meningeal 
enhancement may suggest the diagnosis. 


Viral infection 
Herpes encephalitis 

Axial FLAIR DWI SWI Herpes encephalitis: MRI images show abnormal FLAIR hyperintensity and restricted diffusion in the anterior right temporal lobe with regional mass effect and associated foci of susceptibility representing petechial hemorrhagic conversion (arrow). 
• 
Herpes encephalitis is a devastating (if untreated), necrotizing encephalitis caused by reactivation of latent HSV-1 within the trigeminal ganglion. 

• 
Clinical symptoms are nonspecific, with fever and headache often being prominent complaints. Mental status may be altered. 

• 
Herpes should be the first consideration in any patient with fever, mesial temporal lobe signal abnormality, and acute altered mental status. 

• 
Although lumbar puncture should be obtained before MRI and treatment should never be delayed for MRI, it is important to note that herpes encephalitis may be present when not clinically suspected and PCR of HSV in cerebrospinal fluid is not 100% sensitive. 

• 
Herpes encephalitis causes edema, hemorrhage, and necrosis, typically in the medial temporal lobes and the inferior frontal lobes. 

• 
CT is often normal but can show ill-defined hypoattenuation in the affected regions. 

• 
MRI is much more sensitive and typically shows bilateral (but usually asymmetric) T2 prolongation in the medial temporal lobe, insular cortex, cingulate gyrus, and inferior frontal 


lobe. 
Herpes encephalitis (continued) 
• 
Once the infection becomes hemorrhagic, MRI will show foci of T1 shortening and gradient susceptibility. The affected areas typically demonstrate reduced diffusion. 

• 
Enhancement may develop later in the infection, and is typically gyral in morphology. 

• 
In an immunocompromised patient, HSV-6 infection should be considered with the above findings, although enhancement and diffusion abnormalities may be absent. 

• 
The differential diagnosis of medial temporal lobe lesions includes MCA infarction, infiltrating glioma, limbic encephalitis, and seizure-related changes. Fever is typically absent in infarction and glioma. Herpes encephalitis should be the first consideration in any patient with fever and signal abnormality in the medial temporal lobe. 

• 
Treatment is urgent antiviral therapy. 


HIV encephalopathy 
• 
HIV encephalopathy is the most common CNS infection in AIDS patients. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by direct infection of CNS lymphocytes and microglial cells (CNS macrophages) by the HIV virus. 

• 
On imaging, HIV encephalitis manifests as diffuse cerebral atrophy and symmetric T2 prolongation in the periventricular and deep white matter. 

• 
As previously discussed, in contrast to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), HIV encephalitis spares the subcortical U-fibers and tends to be symmetric. 


Cytomegalovirus (CMV) encephalitis 
• 
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) encephalitis only affects the immunosuppressed, typically when the CD4 cells are less than 50 cells/µL. 

• 
The most common CNS manifestation of CMV infection is ventriculitis or meningoencephalitis. 

• 
The characteristic imaging features of CMV ventriculitis include subependymal FLAIR hyperintensity and enhancement throughout the ventricular system. 

• 
In neonates, CMV is one of the most common TORCH infections and causes atrophy, encephalomalacia, ventricular enlargement, and periventricular calcification. 




Fungal infection 
• 
Radiologic manifestations of CNS fungal infections are often nonspecific, including parenchymal abscesses, granulomas, cerebritis, meningitis, vasculitis, or mycotic aneurysms. 

• 
Imaging features that help distinguish intracranial fungal abscesses from bacterial abscesses include crenated/lobulated border, nonenhancing intracavitary projections (thought to represent fungal hyphae) with restricted diffusion, and a core without restricted diffusion. 

• 
Skull base involvement (basilar meningitis) is a common feature in fungal infections and can present as multiple cranial nerve palsies. 

• 
Fungal mycotic aneurysms often arise from the proximal cerebral vasculature and are fusiform in morphology (due to involvement of long segments of vessel wall), in contrast to bacterial mycotic aneurysms which are typically saccular, small, multiple, and arise distally. 

• 
Immune status of the patient and geographic distribution of some fungal organisms can also help narrow down the differential. 


Fungal organisms that infect immunocompetent patients: Cryptococcus neoformans, Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitidis. Fungal organisms that infect immunocompromised patients: Aspergillus, Candida, Mucormycoses. 
Cryptococcosis 

Cryptococcosis: Axial post-contrast T1-weighted MRI (left image) and DWI (right image) show abnormal enhancement of the choroid plexus (yellow arrows) with cystic components that demonstrate restricted diffusion (red arrows), suggesting cryptococcomas. Lumbar puncture confirmed cryptococcal meningitis. 
• 
Cryptococcosis is the most common CNS fungal infection in patients with AIDS and is caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. It is the third most common CNS infection in AIDS overall, after HIV encephalopathy and toxoplasmosis. 

• 
Similar to toxoplasmosis, AIDS patients become susceptible to cryptococcus with a CD4 count less than 100 cells/µL. The most common clinical presentation is chronic basilar meningitis. The most common imaging finding is hydrocephalus, which is very nonspecific. 

• 
Cryptococcus spreads along the basal ganglia perivascular spaces, leaving behind gelatinous pseudocysts, which appear as round water-signal lesions on T1- and T2-weighted MRI. 

• 
Cryptococcus has a predilection for spread to the choroid plexus, producing ring-enhancing granulomas (called cryptococcomas) within the ventricles. 

• 
Treatment is with antifungal agents including fluconazole and amphotericin B. 


Aspergillosis 
• 
Aspergillus spp. are ubiquitous molds that are angioinvasive and can lead to disseminated disease in immunocompromised patients. Routes of infection include hematogenous spread from the lung, extension from paranasal sinuses, or direct inoculation from trauma. 

• 
Clinical presentation of invasive aspergillosis includes brain abscesses, meningitis, or meningoencephalitis. 

• 
Aspergillus has a propensity to invade blood vessels, leading to vasculitis with secondary thrombosis, infarction, and mycotic aneurysm formation. Superimposed hemorrhage is a 


common feature. 

• Aspergillus abscesses may demonstrate a hypointense rim on T2-weighted and gradient-
echo images (representing hemorrhage and hemosiderin deposition) and peripheral restricted diffusion.  
• Treatment includes voriconazole or amphotericin B. 
Mucormycosis 

Axial FLAIR ADC GRE Cerebral mucormycosis: MRI images show a FLAIR hyperintense lesion in the right caudate head with surrounding vasogenic edema, associated peripheral restricted diffusion (yellow arrow), and susceptibility representing intralesional hemorrhage (red arrow). In this patient with a history of autologous stem cell transplant for T-cell leukemia and clinical concern for systemic infection, these findings are suspicious for a 
fungal infarct. Subsequent biopsy showed mucor. 

• 
Mucormycosis infects a similar patient population to Aspergillus and can be distinguished from aspergillosis by its more aggressive course, higher mortality, and poor response to voriconazole. Intracranial extension from invasive sinusitis is the primary etiology, particularly in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. 

• 
Like aspergillosis, mucormycosis has a propensity for angioinvasion, leading to infarction and necrosis, often with hemorrhagic component. 

• 
CT shows sinusitis with bony destruction. MRI may show frontal lobe lesions with reduced diffusivity, perineural intradural spread, or cavernous sinus thrombosis. 

• 
Treatment includes aggressive surgical debridement, high-dose amphotericin B, and adjuvant supportive therapies. 


Other fungal infections 
• 
CNS candidiasis most commonly presents as multiple brain microabscesses. Meningitis or vascular involvement are less common. 

• 
Disseminated coccidioidomycosis often causes meningitis, or chronic basilar meningitis similar to cryptococcosis that can be complicated by hydrocephalus or ischemic vasculitis. 


Parenchymal abscesses or granulomas are uncommon. 
• Histoplasmosis has a tendency to cause isolated meningitis but can also present as 
granuloma or abscess. 

• Blastomycosis can manifest as meningitis, cerebral abscesses preferentially involving basal ganglia or cerebellum, or vertebral osteomyelitis. 
Neurocysticercosis 


Neurocysticercosis: 
Axial post-contrast T1-weighted MRI (top left image) and axial FLAIR (top right image) show a ring-enhancing lesion (yellow arrow) in the left frontal lobe with surrounding edema (red arrow), representing the colloidal stage of neurocysticercosis. 
Axial noncontrast CT (bottom left image) shows scattered parenchymal and juxtacortical foci of calcification, in keeping with calcified stage of neurocysticercosis. 

• 
Neurocysticercosis is the most common parasitic CNS infection of immunocompetent patients. It is caused by the tapeworm Taenia solium and clinically presents with seizures. 

• 
Four stages of neurocysticercosis have been described: 

1) Viable/vesicular: Imaging shows several CSF-intensity cysts, without enhancement. Many of these cystic lesions may demonstrate an eccentric “dot” representing the scolex. 
2) Colloidal: The colloidal stage has the least specific imaging findings, presenting as ring-enhancing lesions. In contrast to a pyogenic abscess, the lesions feature increased diffusivity. 
3) Nodular/granular: Edema decreases as the cyst involutes and the cyst wall thickens. 
4) Calcified: Imaging shows small parenchymal calcifications (on CT) and small foci of susceptibility (GRE). 

• 
Intraventricular neurocysticercosis can occur in up to 20% of cases, typically in the aqueduct of Sylvius or the fourth ventricle. Hydrocephalus may be the initial presentation, with the obstructing cyst most apparent on FLAIR images because the protein-rich intracystic fluid will not be nulled on FLAIR. 

• 
The racemose form of neurocysticercosis is an older term describing a variant without a visible scolex, now thought to represent degeneration of the scolex. 

• 
Treatment is with antiparasitic medications including albendazole, supplemented with steroids for edema and anti-seizure medications as needed. 


Toxoplasmosis 





• 
Toxoplasmosis is the most common mass lesion in AIDS patients and is caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. AIDS patients become susceptible to the parasite with a CD4 count less than 100 cells/µL. Toxoplasmosis is the second most common CNS infection in AIDS patients, with HIV encephalitis being the most common. 

• 
The typical appearance of toxoplasmosis is single or multiple ring-enhancing lesions in the basal ganglia. 

• 
The asymmetric target sign is not frequently seen but is relatively specific and describes an eccentric nodule of enhancement along the enhancing wall of the toxoplasmosis lesion. 

• 
The primary differential consideration of a basal ganglia mass in an immunocompromised patient is CNS lymphoma. In contrast to CNS lymphoma, toxoplasmosis is hypometabolic on FDG-PET, is not thallium-avid, does not demonstrate reduced relative cerebral blood volume on perfusion, and will respond to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Toxoplasmosis lesions usually have increased diffusivity. In contrast, CNS lymphoma tends to have reduced diffusivity due to hypercellularity. 


Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) 

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: Axial FLAIR (top row), and DWI (bottom row) show diffusely increased FLAIR signal with restricted diffusion (when correlated to ADC maps, not shown) in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and dorsomedial thalamus. There is relative sparing of the motor cortex (red arrows). A hockey stick sign is visible in the thalami on the first FLAIR image (yellow arrows).

• 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare neurodegenerative disease caused by a prion. 

• 
The typical MRI appearance of CJD is cortical ribboning, which describes ribbon-like FLAIR hyperintensity and restricted diffusion of the cerebral cortex. The basal ganglia and thalami are also involved. There is often sparing of the motor cortex. 

• 
The pulvinar sign describes bright DWI and FLAIR signal within the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus. The hockey stick sign describes bright DWI and FLAIR signal within the dorsomedial thalamus. 




Hockey stick sign of CJD: FLAIR (close-up of top left FLAIR image above with the thalami outlined in yellow) 
shows hyperintensity of the dorsomedial thalami, 
mimicking the shape of a hockey stick.
