Cerebral trauma 
Extra-axial hemorrhage 
• Acute extra-axial hemorrhage (subarachnoid, epidural, or subdural in location) is usually hyperattenuating when imaged by CT; however, blood must clot in order to be hyperattenuating. Hyperacute unclotted blood (and clotted blood in a patient with severe anemia) may be close to water attenuation on CT. 



Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) 
• Trauma is the most common cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), while aneurysm 
rupture is the most common cause of non-traumatic SAH. 
• Traumatic SAH tends to occur contralateral to the side of direct impact, most often in the superficial cerebral sulci. 
Epidural hematoma 
• An arterial epidural hematoma is an extra-axial collection of blood external to the dura, classically caused by fracture of the squamous portion of the temporal bone and resultant 
tearing of the middle meningeal artery. 
• An arterial epidural hematoma has a lentiform shape and does not cross the cranial sutures, 
where the dura is tightly adherent to the cranium. 
• 
The swirl sign describes mixed high and low attenuation blood within the hematoma and suggests active bleeding. The low attenuation blood is hyperacute unclotted blood while the high attenuation blood is already clotted. 

• 
A large epidural hematoma is a surgical emergency due to mass effect and risk of herniation, although small epidural hematomas can be conservatively managed with serial imaging. 

• 
Venous epidural hematomas are far less common than arterial epidurals and are due to 


laceration of the dural sinuses. Common locations are anterior middle cranial fossa and 
posterior fossa. 

Anterior middle fossa epidural hematomas are nearly always venous, rarely expand, have a clinically indolent course, and therefore do not require surgical intervention. In contrast, posterior fossa venous epidural hematomas may require surgical evacuation due to associated mass effect.

Subdural hematoma 
• A subdural hematoma is a crescentic extra-axial collection of blood located beneath the dura. Since it is underneath the dura, the hematoma can extend across the cranial sutures. 
Subdural hematomas often extend along the surfaces of the falx cerebri and tentorium 
cerebelli. 

• 
Subdural hematomas typically result from tearing of cerebral veins. Patients with atrophic involutional changes are at increased risk of subdural hematoma with even minor trauma, as the cerebral veins stretch to traverse the enlarged CSF spaces. 

• 
A particular danger is a subdural hematoma in a patient with a ventricular shunt because the shunted ventricular system does not function as a natural tamponade. 

• 
An isodense subdural hematoma is isoattenuating to gray matter. This occurs in the subacute phase approximately 1–3 weeks after the initial injury. Three important clues alerting to the presence of an isodense subdural are increased mass effect, white matter buckling, and an 


apparently thickened cortex. 
Intraventricular hemorrhage 
• 
Intraventricular hemorrhage can occur due to tearing of subependymal veins or from direct extension of subarachnoid or intraparenchymal hematoma. 

• 
Patients with intraventricular hemorrhage are at increased risk of developing noncommunicating hydrocephalus due to ependymal scarring, which may obstruct the 


cerebral aqueduct. 



Intra-axial injury 
Coup/contrecoup mechanism 
• The coup/contrecoup mechanism of brain trauma describes the propensity for brain to be injured both at the initial site of impact and 180° opposite the impact site, due to secondary impaction against the cranial vault. 

Cortical contusion 
• 
A cortical contusion is caused by traumatic contact of the cortical surface of the brain against the rough inner table of the skull. Contusions affect the gyral crests and can occur in a coup or a contrecoup location. 

• 
A subacute cortical contusion may demonstrate ring enhancement and should be considered in the differential of a ring-enhancing lesion if there is a history of trauma. Enhancement may continue into the chronic stage. 

• 
A chronic contusion appears as encephalomalacia on CT. MRI is more specific, showing peripheral hemosiderin deposition as hypointense on T2-weighted images and blooming artifact on gradient echo sequences. 


Intraparenchymal hematoma 
• 
Traumatic intraparenchymal hematoma can occur in various locations, ranging from cortical contusion to basal ganglia hemorrhage (due to shearing of lenticulostriate vessels). 

• 
Similar to a cortical contusion, a subacute intraparenchymal hematoma may show ring enhancement.

Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) / Traumatic axonal injury (TAI) 
• Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is the result of a shear-strain deformation of the 
brain. 

• The term traumatic axonal injury (TAI) has recently been introduced as this injury pattern is thought to be multifocal rather than diffuse; however, this text will use the term DAI, as that is 
the more common term. 

• DAI is caused by rotational deceleration and subsequent reacceleration force that exceeds the limited elastic capacity 
of the axons. 

• DAI occurs at several characteristic sites, depending on the severity. The higher the grade, the worse the prognosis. 

Grade I DAI involves only the gray-white matter junctions of the cerebral hemispheres. Grade II DAI additionally involves the corpus callosum. Grade III DAI additionally involves the dorsolateral, rostral midbrain. 
• 
CT is relatively insensitive for detection of DAI, although hemorrhagic DAI may show tiny foci of high attenuation in the affected regions. 

• 
MRI is much more sensitive to detect DAI, although detection relies on multiple sequences, 


including FLAIR, SWI/GRE, and DWI. SWI is extremely sensitive for hemorrhagic axonal injury; however, not all DAI is hemorrhagic. FLAIR is most sensitive for nonhemorrhagic DAI. Diffusion sequences show restricted diffusion in acute DAI due to cytotoxic edema and cell swelling.
