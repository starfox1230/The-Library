Subarachnoid hemorrhage and aneurysms 
Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) 

Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Noncontrast CT (left image) shows diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (arrows) in the basal cisterns including the suprasellar cistern, the anterior interhemispheric fissure, and the Sylvian fissure, predominantly on the right. Frontal oblique digital subtraction cerebral angiogram (right image) of the right internal carotid artery shows a small saccular aneurysm at the MCA trifurcation (yellow arrow). 
• 
Overall, the most common cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is trauma. Aneurysm rupture is by far the most common cause of non-traumatic SAH. No cause of the SAH is identified in up to 22% of cases. 

• 
Clinically, non-traumatic SAH presents with thunderclap headache and meningismus. 

• 
Noncontrast CT is the initial imaging modality in suspected SAH. On CT, subarachnoid blood appears as high attenuation within the subarachnoid space. 


High attenuation material in the subarachnoid space may be due to SAH (by far the most common cause), meningitis, leptomeningeal metastases, or prior intrathecal contrast administration. 
• Noncontrast CT is >95% sensitive for detecting SAH within the first 6 hours, with sensitivity slowly decreasing to 50% by day 5. If clinical suspicion for SAH is high with a negative CT 
scan, the standard of care is to perform a lumbar puncture to look for xanthochromia. 
• If SAH is present on imaging or lumbar puncture shows xanthochromia, catheter angiography is the gold standard to evaluate for the presence of an aneurysm. Several recent studies have shown, however, that CT angiography is equivalent to catheter 
angiography in the search for a culprit aneurysm in cases of SAH. 
• On MRI, acute SAH appears hyperintense on FLAIR and demonstrates susceptibility artifact on gradient sequences. 
The differential diagnosis for increased FLAIR signal in the subarachnoid space is similar to the differential for high attenuation subarachnoid material seen on CT, including SAH, meningitis, leptomeningeal metastases, and residual contrast material. Note that meningitis and metastases will typically show leptomeningeal enhancement in addition to the abnormal FLAIR signal. 
Recent oxygen or propofol administration will also cause increased subarachnoid FLAIR signal. 
• 
The pattern of SAH may provide a clue to the location of the ruptured aneurysm. However, multiple aneurysms are seen in up to 20% of patients with SAH, and subarachnoid blood may redistribute if the patient was found down. 

• 
Hemorrhage in the anterior interhemispheric fissure suggests an anterior communicating artery aneurysm (33% of intracranial aneurysms). 

• 
Hemorrhage in the suprasellar cistern suggests a posterior communicating artery aneurysm (also 33% of intracranial aneurysms). Rarely, P-comm aneurysm rupture can result in 


isolated subdural hemorrhage. 
• 
Hemorrhage in the Sylvian fissure suggests a middle cerebral artery aneurysm (20% of intracranial aneurysms). 

• 
Hemorrhage in the perimesencephalic cistern suggests either a basilar tip aneurysm (5% of intracranial aneurysms), which has a high morbidity, or the relatively benign nonaneurysmal 


perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage (subsequently discussed). 
Grading of subarachnoid hemorrhage 
• The Hunt and Hess score is the clinical grading scale for aneurysmal SAH and is based solely 
on symptoms, without imaging. Grade I is the lowest grade, with only a mild headache. Grade V is the most severe, with coma or extensor posturing. 
• The modified Fischer scale classifies the CT appearance of aneurysmal SAH and correlates with risk of delayed cerebral ischemia. 
Thin SAH (<1 mm) is grade 1 without intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and grade 2 with IVH. Thick SAH (=1 mm) is grade 3 without IVH and grade 4 with IVH. 
Complications of subarachnoid hemorrhage 
• Vasospasm is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who survive the initial episode of SAH. The peak incidence of vasospasm occurs most frequently 7–10 days after aneurysm rupture and resolves spontaneously after 21 days. Vasospasm results in delayed cerebral ischemia, which can cause infarction. 

Vasospasm: Two coronal-oblique maximum-intensity projection images from subsequent CT angiograms, in the plane of the basilar artery. The initial study (left image) shows severe narrowing of the basilar artery, left AICA (right not visible), and distal vertebral arteries. The follow-up study (right image) was performed after endovascular treatment, which shows a normal caliber of the basilar and left vertebral arteries. 
• 
The gold standard for diagnosing vasospasm is digital subtraction angiography (DSA), which allows for concurrent treatment. Disadvantages of DSA include need for trained personnel, radiation exposure, contrast load, as well as potential for procedure-related complications. 

• 
Compared to DSA, less invasive imaging methods for detection/monitoring of vasospasm include transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) and CT angiography (CTA). In cases 


of poor clinical grade, many guidelines recommend serial TCD for monitoring and CT 
angiography with or without perfusion in cases when there is clinical deterioration or in situations where TCD results are equivocal. 
• 
Use of TCD is limited by availability of acoustic windows, operator experience, and limited evaluation of distal vessels. It has been proven useful for early detection and to help identify clinically occult cases when patients are heavily sedated. CT is useful because of its rapid availability, relative ease of interpretation, and better visualization of distal vasculature. Newer techniques such as CT and MR perfusion and nuclear medicine studies are also being investigated to identify areas of cerebral ischemia. 

• 
Oral nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, is used for prophylaxis for delayed cerebral ischemia. Conventional medical treatment of vasospasm includes triple H therapy, describing the use of “hypervolemia, hemodilution, and hypertension” to maintain blood pressure to the cerebral vasculature. 

• 
Endovascular therapy with intra-arterial (IA) vasodilators and transluminal balloon angioplasty (TBA) are used in cases of severe or medically refractory vasospasm. Calcium channel blockers are the preferred pharmacologic class for IA vasodilation. 

• 
Acute hydrocephalus occurs in 15-87% of patients with aneurysmal SAH. Acute hydrocephalus is usually managed by external ventricular drainage (EVD) or lumbar drainage. Chronic hydrocephalus occurs in 8.9-48% of patients and is managed with ventricular shunt placement. 

• 
Superficial siderosis is a condition caused by iron overload of pial membranes due to chronic or repeated subarachnoid bleeding. Clinically, patients with superficial siderosis 


present with sensorineural deafness and ataxia. On imaging, the iron causes hypointensity 
on T2-weighted images outlining the affected sulci. 
• Imaging workup includes cranial and spinal imaging to evaluate for a source of bleeding.

territory temporal lobes (right image).

• Perimesencephalic subarachnoid 
hemorrhage is a pattern of nontraumatic SAH of likely venous origin that has a benign prognosis compared to other types. Patients with this pattern need less aggressive evaluation to exclude an aneurysm (e.g., 
CTA alone, or a single catheter angiogram without follow-up). 
• To predict the absence of an aneurysm 
with specificity, the hemorrhage must be 
centered in the cisterns directly anterior to the brainstem in the interpeduncular 
or prepontine cisterns but may extend 
into the suprasellar, crural, ambient, 
and/or quadrigeminal cisterns and/or 
cisterna magna. Some criteria also allow hemorrhage centered in the posterior suprasellar cistern, extension into the 
medial Sylvian fissures or anterior interhemispheric fissure, and/or a small amount of intraventricular blood. 
• Although the clinical presentation of perimesencephalic nonaneurysmal SAH is similar to aneurysm rupture (thunderclap headache), patients generally do well without residual neurological deficit. Some patients may experience mild to moderate vasospasm. 
Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) 
• Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is a cause of nontraumatic, nonaneurysmal SAH and ischemia. RCVS presents with thunderclap headache and is 
characterized by prolonged (but reversible) vasoconstriction. 


Aneurysm morphology and pathology 
Saccular aneurysm 

Ophthalmic artery aneurysm: Sagittal projection left common carotid arteriogram (left image) demonstrates a superiorly directed saccular aneurysm (yellow arrow) arising at the ostium of the ophthalmic artery (red arrow). Right image shows a 3D reconstruction of the aneurysm. 
• A saccular (also called berry) aneurysm is a focal outpouching of the arterial wall, most 
commonly arising at a branch point in the circle of Willis, and has a characteristic rounded shape. The aneurysm points in the direction of blood flow leading into the branch point. Saccular aneurysms are seen almost exclusively in adults, with a slight female predominance. Saccular aneurysms are caused by a combination of hemodynamic stress and acquired degeneration of the vessel wall. 
• 
Saccular aneurysms can be classified as small (<1 cm), medium (>1 cm and <2.5 cm), and giant (>2.5 cm). The larger the size, the greater the risk for rupture. 

• 
Giant aneurysms often present with mass effect, can mimic a mass (especially if partially thrombosed) and can cause a cranial nerve palsy. The most common is an oculomotor nerve palsy caused by a posterior communicating artery aneurysm. 

• 
Minute aneurysms which occur as a result of chronic hypertension occurring most commonly in the basal ganglia are termed Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms. 

• 
Non-inherited risk factors for the development of saccular aneurysm include hypertension, inflammatory vascular disease such as Takayasu or giant cell arteritis, and hemodynamic stress from altered state of cerebral blood flow such as due to moyamoya (aneurysms occur most commonly in the posterior circulation) or AVM. 

• 
Inherited diseases that predispose to aneurysm formation include connective tissue diseases such as Marfan and Ehlers-Danlos, polycystic kidney disease, and neurofibromatosis type 1. 

• 
The aneurysm neck is the opening which connects the aneurysm to the parent vessel and the aneurysm body is the aneurysm sac. The neck:body ratio affects treatment options. Aneurysms with relatively small necks are generally easier to treat endovascularly with endovascular coils. 

• 
Anterior communicating artery (A-comm) aneurysms: Patients most commonly present with subarachnoid hemorrhage, frequently in the interhemispheric fissure. A-comm aneurysms are also associated with intraventricular hemorrhage, most commonly the lateral ventricles. 

• 
Anterior cerebral artery (ACA) is the most common location for aneurysms associated with intracerebral hemorrhage. 

• 
Internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms are named based on which segment it arises from. Cavernous ICA aneurysms are extradural, when nontraumatic are usually fusiform and expand laterally 


into the cavernous sinus. Typical presentation is with CN III, IV, VI palsy. Rupture can produce a carotid-cavernous fistula or severe epistaxis from blood extrusion into the sphenoid sinus. Paraclinoid ICA aneurysms are classically distal to the dural ring (therefore intradural) and include 
ophthalmic and superior hypophyseal aneurysms. There is anatomic variability which results in some 
superior hypophyseal aneurysms and a minority of ophthalmic aneurysms being intradural. 
Supraclinoid ICA aneurysms include posterior communicating artery (P-comm) and anterior choroidal aneurysms. P-comm aneurysms arise just distal to the P-comm ostium and project posterolaterally, which may impact cranial nerve III with classic presentation of pupil-sparing CN III palsy. 
Carotid bifurcation or terminus aneurysms occur at the point where the ICA divides into the MCA and ACA. 
These aneurysms present with subarachnoid hemorrhage and generally point superiorly. 
• 
Most middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms occur at the M1 bifurcation, which is the second most common location for aneurysm presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage. 

• 
Basilar tip aneurysms classically produce subarachnoid hemorrhage centered in the interpeduncular cistern with extension to the suprasellar and anterior and posterior perimesencephalic cisterns.  

• 
Posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysms present with subarachnoid hemorrhage and clinically can present with localized head and neck ache, meningismus, and CN VI palsy. Presence of apparently isolated intraventricular hemorrhage in the fourth ventricle is suggestive of PICA aneurysm. 


Fusiform aneurysm 
• 
A fusiform aneurysm is a type of intracranial aneurysm characterized by an elongated fusiform shape, without a defined neck. Fusiform aneurysms are usually due to atherosclerosis, but may arise from chronic dissection. 

• 
In contrast to saccular aneurysms, fusiform aneurysms do not occur at branch points. 

• 
The vertebrobasilar system is affected more commonly than the anterior circulation. 

• 
Fusiform aneurysms are much less common than saccular aneurysms. However, since there is no aneurysm neck to exclude from the systemic circulation, fusiform aneurysms are more difficult to treat. Fusiform aneurysms of the vertebrobasilar system pose particular challenges, as critical perforating vessels may arise directly from the diseased artery. 




Mycotic aneursym and cerebritis in a patient with known fungal endocarditis: 
Axial MRA (top left image) demonstrates a small irregular outpouching arising from a left M2 branch in the Sylvian fissure, better depicted on the MIP image (bottom left), which is concerning for mycotic 
aneurysm (arrows). 
Axial FLAIR shows surrounding T2 prolongation in the left medial temporal lobe abutting the posterior aspect of the Sylvian fissure, likely focal cerebritis. 
• 
Mycotic aneurysms account for only 2–4% of all intracranial aneurysms and are due to septic emboli. Bacterial endocarditis is the most common embolic source. 

• 
Mycotic aneurysms are more common in the anterior circulation than the posterior circulation. In contrast to saccular aneurysms, they tend to be peripherally located and fusiform in shape. Mycotic aneurysms are fragile and have a high risk of rupture. 

• 
Cross-sectional imaging with CT angiogram/MR angiogram has a sensitivity of approximately 50% with high interobserver variability. Therefore, DSA remains the gold standard for evaluation of myotic aneurysms. 


Oncotic aneurysm 
• 
An oncotic aneurysm is an aneurysm caused by neoplasm. 

• 
A benign left atrial myxoma may peripherally embolize and cause a distal oncotic aneurysm. 


Traumatic pseudoaneurysm 
• Aneurysms due to trauma are most commonly pseudoaneurysms, which don’t contain the typical three histologic layers of the vessel wall. Usually the vessel will exhibit abnormal luminal narrowing proximal to the aneurysm. Similar to mycotic aneurysms, traumatic 
pseudoaneurysms tend to occur distally. 
• Arteries close to bony structures (such as the basilar and vertebral artery) are prone to dissecting aneurysms.
