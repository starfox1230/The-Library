Neurovascular anatomy 
Internal carotid artery (ICA) 

• The segmental nomenclature of the internal carotid artery (ICA) is not universally agreed upon. The simplest is the Gibo classification, reflected below along with the major branches. 
Note that many of the branches are infrequently seen on imaging. 
• 
The cervical segment extends from the carotid bifurcation to the skull base and gives off no branches. 

• 
The petrous segment extends through the carotid canal and slightly past foramen lacerum while giving off the caroticotympanic and Vidian arteries. 

• 
The cavernous segment begins a series of back-and-forth bends historically called the 


"carotid siphon" while giving off the meningohypophyseal trunk and the inferolateral trunk. 
The meningohypophyseal trunk supplies the pituitary and nearby meninges. 
The inferolateral trunk supplies the third through sixth cranial nerves and nearby meninges. 
• The supraclinoid segment is the intradural portion that gives off the ophthalmic, superior hypophyseal, posterior communicating, and anterior choroidal arteries. The ophthalmic artery supplies the orbital structures. It can be used as a landmark for the distal dural 
ring, such that aneurysms located at or superior to the ophthalmic artery are intradural. Given the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage, these aneurysms are treated more aggressively than aneurysms located 
proximal to the distal dural ring, which are contained. The superior hypophyseal artery supplies the hypothalamus and pituitary stalk. The posterior communicating artery (P-comm) is an anastomosis to the posterior circulation. A fetal 
posterior cerebral artery (PCA) is a variant supplied entirely by the ipsilateral ICA via an enlarged P-comm. 
The anterior choroidal artery supplies the anteromesial temporal lobe including the head of 
hippocampus, as well as deep brain structures including the optic tract, lateral thalamus, and posterior limb and retrolenticular part of the internal capsule. 
• The ICA terminus bifurcates into the anterior and middle cerebral arteries.

Critical small arteries arising from the circle of Willis 
• 
The A1 segment of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) travels above the optic nerves and gives off the recurrent artery of Heubner, which supplies the caudate head and anterior limb of the internal capsule. The A1 segment also gives rise to the medial lenticulostriate perforator vessels which supply the medial basal ganglia. 

• 
Just outside the circle of Willis, the middle cerebral artery (MCA) gives rise to the lateral lenticulostriate perforator vessels to supply the lateral basal ganglia including the lateral 


putamen, external capsule, and the posterior limb of the internal capsule. 
• 
The posterior communicating artery (P-comm) travels between optic tract and cranial nerve III, giving off anterior thalamoperforator vessels. A P-comm aneurysm may cause cranial nerve III palsy due to local mass effect. 

• 
The posterior cerebral artery (PCA) gives off thalamoperforators to supply the thalamus. Artery of Percheron is a variant where there is a dominant thalamic perforator supplying the ventromedial thalami bilaterally and the rostral midbrain, arising from a P1 PCA segment. An artery of Percheron infarct will result in bilateral ventromedial thalamic infarction, with or without midbrain infarction (the infarct may be V shaped if the midbrain is involved). Deep venous thrombosis may also result in bilateral thalamic infarcts. 

• 
The anterior choroidal artery is the most distal branch of the internal carotid artery. As discussed on the previous page, it supplies the optic chiasm, hippocampus, and posterior 


limb of the internal capsule.

• 
Normal circle of Willis anatomy is only seen approximately 25% of the time. 

• 
Fenestration is when an artery divides into two separate channels and then recombines into a single vessel. The two channels each have its own endothelial and muscularis layers, but may share an adventitial layer. Fenestration is more commonly seen in the vertebrobasilar system than other intracranial arteries. It is associated with aneurysm formation. 

• 
Duplication is when an artery splits into two distinct vessels with no distal convergence. 

• 
Azygos ACA is associated with holoprosencephaly, neuronal migration anomalies, and aneurysm formation. Occlusion of the azygos ACA will lead to ischemia in both hemispheres. 

• 
Other ACA anomalies include trifurcation (2–13%) with three A2 segments, and bihemispheric ACA (2–7%) where a dominant A2 supplies bilateral ACA territories, while the contralateral A2 segment is hypoplastic. Similar to azygos ACA, occlusion of the dominant A2 segment will affect both hemispheres.

M1 extends from the ICA terminus M1     to the origin of the Sylvian ÿssure. 
M2 extends posteriorly from the bottom      to the top of the Sylvian ÿssure. 
M3 extends laterally from the top of      the Sylvian ÿssure to the cortical surface.

• Although the transition from M1 to M2 is technically defined as the upward point of deflection into the Sylvian fissure, in practical terms, the pre-bifurcation MCA is often called M1 and the post-bifurcation MCA is called M2. 

Persistent carotid-basilar connections 
Overview of persistent fetal anterior-posterior connections 
• 
A number of carotid to basilar connections are formed during embryogenesis. These fetal anterior-posterior circulation connections normally regress before birth. 

• 
Occasionally, a fetal carotid-basilar connection may persist after birth. Each anomalous connection is named for the structures adjacent to its course in the head and neck. 



Persistent trigeminal artery 


Axial FLAIR image shows flow-void associated with a vessel (arrow) traversing through the clivus between the basilar artery and the right cavernous ICA, compatible with a 
persistent trigeminal artery. 
• 
A persistent trigeminal artery is the most common persistent carotid-basilar connection and has an association with aneurysms. 

• 
The persistent trigeminal artery courses adjacent to the trigeminal nerve. Angiography shows a characteristic trident or tau sign on the lateral view due to the artery’s branching structure. 

• 
Saltzman type I connects to the basilar artery while Saltzman type II connects to the superior cerebellar artery. 



Less common carotid to basilar connections 
• The otic, hypoglossal, and proatlantal intersegmental arteries are rare persistent carotid-basilar connections.
