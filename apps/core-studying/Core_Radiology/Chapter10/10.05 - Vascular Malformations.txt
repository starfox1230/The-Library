Ruptured arteriovenous malformation: Noncontrast CT shows a right occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage. CTA shows a large tangle of vessels in the right occipital lobe (yellow arrow). Angiography better demonstrates the nidus (red arrow) and early venous drainage via dilated superficial cortical veins (blue arrow) to the superior sagittal sinus. There is no deep venous drainage. The nidus is predominantly supplied by branches of 
the right PCA. 
• An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a congenital high-flow vascular malformation consisting of directly connecting arteries and veins without an intervening capillary bed. AVM occurs intra-axially and 85% are supratentorial. AVM usually presents with seizures or bleeding (usually parenchymal hemorrhage, rarely subarachnoid). Aneurysms of the feeding arteries or intra-nidal arteries are often seen, which predispose to bleeding. 
• The Spetzler-Martin scale helps to evaluate surgical risk for AVM resection. A large AVM (>6 cm) draining to a deep venous sinus system in eloquent cortex has the highest risk, while a small AVM (<3 cm) draining to a superficial venous sinus system in non-eloquent cortex has the lowest risk. 
• 
On imaging, AVM is characterized by a vascular nidus (“nest”) containing numerous serpentine vessels that appear as black flow-voids on MRI. There are usually adjacent changes to the adjacent brain including gliosis (T2 prolongation), dystrophic calcification, and blood products (blooming on T2* gradient imaging). The gliosis/encephalomalacia or mineralization seen in the adjacent brain is due to alteration in vascular flow from the AVM. 

• 
AVM replaces rather than displaces brain. It causes minimal mass effect. 

• 
Uncommonly, a bleeding AVM may be angiographically occult if the malformed vessels are compressed by the acute hematoma. 

• 
Factors that increase bleeding risk that are detectable by imaging include intra-nidal 


aneurysm, venous ectasia, venous stenosis, deep venous drainage, and posterior fossa location. 
• Treatment can be with embolization, stereotactic radiation, or surgical resection. 
Dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF) 
• 
Dural arteriovenous fistulas are a complex group of high-flow lesions characterized by arteriovenous shunts between the meningeal arterioles and dural venules. 

• 
The primary prognostic feature is the presence and degree of cortical venous drainage. The Cognard classification I through IV describes lesions with progressively increased risk of 


bleeding. 
Type I: No cortical venous drainage. Lowest  Type III: Direct cortical venous drainage:  
risk of bleeding.  40% hemorrhage rate.  
Type IIA: Reflux into dural sinus but not  Type IV: Direct cortical venous drainage with venous  
cortical veins.  ectasia: 66% hemorrhage rate.  
Type IIB: Reflux into cortical veins:  Type V: Spinal venous drainage. May cause  
10–20% hemorrhage rate.  myelopathy.  

• 
Carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) is a subtype of dAVF that is often caused by trauma with resultant fistula between the cavernous carotid artery and the cavernous sinus. Enlargement of the superior orbital vein and shunting within the cavernous sinus can lead to eye symptoms, such as proptosis and cranial nerve palsy. 

• 
Vein of Galen malformation is a type of vascular malformation characterized by arteriovenous fistulae from thalamoperforator branches into the deep venous system. The enlarged vein is actually an enlarged median prosencephalic vein. 


In childhood, a vein of Galen malformation is the most common extracardiac cause of high output cardiac failure. Vein of Galen malformation may also be seen in adults, but clinically would be either asymptomatic or may be the cause of Parinaud syndrome due to mass effect in the pineal region. 

Low-flow lesions (lesions without shunting) 
Cavernous malformation (cavernoma) 

Cavernous malformation and associated DVA: Two axial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images show a hypointense, centrally hyperintense nonenhancing cavernous malformation (yellow arrow) in the left cerebellar hemisphere. Directly superior to the cavernoma (right image) is an enhancing vascular structure with caput medusa morphology (red arrow), representing a developmental venous anomaly. 


Giant cavernous malformation in a different patient: Axial unenhanced CT (top left image) shows a hyperattenuating complex 
mass (arrows) in the right fronto-temporal lobe. 
Unenhanced T1-weighted image (top middle image) shows the mass is predominantly cystic and hyperintense (representing blood products). 
Axial FLAIR (top right image) shows that the intracystic contents are 
primarily hyperintense. There is a complete low signal hemosiderin ring surrounding the lesion (red arrows). There is mild surrounding edema. 
Post contrast axial T1-weighted image (left image) shows no appreciable 
enhancement.

• 
A cavernous malformation (also called a cavernoma) is a vascular hamartoma with a very small but definite bleeding risk. The clinical course of a cavernous malformation is variable and the lesion may cause seizures even in the absence of significant hemorrhage. 

• 
Cavernous malformation is often associated with an adjacent developmental venous anomaly (DVA). There is increased risk of bleeding if a DVA is present. However, the DVA itself does not have any bleeding risk. 

• 
Multiple, cavernous malformations represent an inherited disorder called familial cerebral cavernous malformation syndrome. 

• 
Cavernous malformations can be induced by radiation treatment to the brain. 

• 
Noncontrast CT shows a well-circumscribed rounded hyperattenuating lesion. The hyperattenuation is due to microcalcification within the cavernoma. 

• 
MRI shows characteristic “popcorn-like” appearance of lobular mixed signal on T1­and T2-weighted images from blood products of various ages. There is a peripheral rim of hemosiderin which is dark on GRE and T2-weighted image. There is typically no enhancement, but intense enhancement may be seen with a long delay after contrast administration. Cavernous malformations may range in size from tiny (single focus of susceptibility artifact) to giant. 

• 
Cavernous malformations are usually occult by vascular imaging (CTA or angiography). 


Developmental venous anomaly (DVA), also called venous angioma 

Developmental venous anomaly and a tiny cavernous malformation: Post-contrast axial T1-weighted MRI (left image) shows a subtle curvilinear enhancing structure (yellow arrows) in the right frontal white matter representing a DVA. Susceptibility weighted image (right image) shows a focus of susceptibility artifact (red arrow), suggestive of an adjacent cavernous malformation.

• 
A developmental venous anomaly (DVA) is an abnormal vein that provides functional venous drainage to normal brain. 

• 
DVA can usually only be seen on contrast-enhanced or susceptibility-weighted images, where it appears as a radially oriented vein with a characteristic caput medusa appearance. 

• 
A DVA is a Do Not Touch lesion. If resected, the patient will suffer a debilitating venous infarct similar to acute thrombosis of DVA. The DVA must be preserved if an adjacent cavernous malformation is resected. 


Capillary telangiectasia 

Capillary telangiectasia: Axial post-contrast T1-weighted MRI (left image) shows faint focal enhancement in the dorsal pons with associated susceptibility artifact (right SWI image) (arrows). 
• 
A capillary telangiectasia is an asymptomatic vascular lesion composed of dilated capillaries with interspersed normal brain. A capillary telangiectasia is another Do Not Touch lesion. 

• 
Post-contrast MRI shows a faint, brush-stroke-like enhancing lesion, most commonly in the brainstem or pons, without mass effect or surrounding edema. GRE often shows blooming due to susceptibility. 

• 
Similar to cavernous malformation, capillary telangiectasia is angiographically occult. 

• 
Capillary telangiectasia can mimic an enhancing tumor, although they can be differentiated from other lesions by their occult appearance on T2 and FLAIR sequences.
