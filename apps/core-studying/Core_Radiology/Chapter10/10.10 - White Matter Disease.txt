White matter disease 
White matter overview 
White matter imaging overview 
• 
The typical MRI appearance of white matter injury is T2 prolongation of the affected white matter. Less commonly, tumefactive demyelination may be mass-like, enhance, and look very similar to a tumor. 

• 
The key imaging finding of demyelinating disease is minimal mass effect relative to the lesion size. 

• 
A frequent pattern of white matter disease consisting of scattered foci of T2 prolongation in the subcortical, deep, and periventricular white matter is seen very commonly, especially in older adults. In older patients, this pattern is most likely due to chronic microvascular ischemia. In younger patients, a similar pattern can be seen in chronic migraine headaches, as sequela of prior infectious or inflammatory disease, and with demyelination. 



Normal structures may mimic white matter disease on T2 images 
• Virchow-Robin spaces are tiny perivascular spaces that follow deep penetrating vessels 
into the subarachnoid space. They are common in the basal ganglia and the midbrain. On CT, Virchow-Robin spaces can mimic chronic lacunar infarcts, but are usually present in 
the lower third of the basal ganglia. On MRI, Virchow-Robin spaces follow CSF signal on all sequences, including FLAIR. Enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces and a J-shaped sella can be seen in the mucopolysaccharidoses. 
• Ependymitis granularis represents frontal horn periventricular hyperintensity on T2­weighted images due to interstitial CSF backup. Despite the name (“-itis”), ependymitis granularis is not associated with inflammation. 


Idiopathic/autoimmune/inflammatory white matter disease 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) 
• 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is idiopathic inflammatory destruction of CNS axons in the brain and spinal cord. MS is likely autoimmune in etiology and may be associated with other autoimmune diseases such as Graves disease and myasthenia gravis. 

• 
MS is the most common chronic demyelinating disease. It often leads to severe disability. 

• 
MS is more common in middle-aged Caucasian females from northern latitudes. 

• 
There are two main clinical presentations of MS: 


1) Relapsing-remitting (most common): Partial or complete resolution of each acute attack. 
2) Progressive: No resolution or incomplete resolution between acute attacks. Primary progressive: Slow onset without discrete exacerbations. Secondary progressive: Similar to relapsing-remitting but with less complete resolution between 
attacks, leading to progressive disability. 
• The diagnostic criteria for MS has been based on two concepts: the detection of focal neurological disease disseminated in space and time, based on clinical symptoms and brain MRI findings. The specific findings that constitute a diagnosis have been described as the McDonald criteria, which was most recently revised in 2017. The MacDonald criteria also describe intermediate diagnoses that do not meet all clinical or radiologic criteria simultaneously as clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS). 
• 
Dissemination in space can be demonstrated by detection of T2 hyperintense lesions at least 3 mm in size in at least two of the classically affected areas: the periventricular white matter, spinal cord, infratentorial brain, juxtacortical white matter or cerebral cortex. Cortical lesions were an addition of the most recent revision. 

• 
Dissemination in time based on MRI can be demonstrated by the presence of simultaneous 


presence of both gadolinium-enhancing and non-enhancing lesions on a single study or 
by the presence of new lesions demonstrating hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging or 
gadolinium enhancement on subsequent studies. 
• 
Histopathologically, destruction of myelin is caused by lymphocytes attacking oligodendrocytes (which make CNS myelin). 

• 
As described in the McDonald criteria, focal areas of involvement manifest as lesions that are hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging. The presence of enhancement is suggestive of active demyelination, while the lack of enhancement suggests a chronic lesion. This allows for demonstration of dissemination in time on a single scan, as described above. 

• 
There are certain areas of the brain where lesion involvement is more suggestive of MS over alternative diagnoses. This includes the periventricular region, corpus callosum, subcortical white matter, temporal lobe white matter, the brainstem, cerebellum, and the cervical portion of the spinal cord. 


Periventricular lesions have classically been described as Dawson fingers due to their ovoid configuration perpendicular to the ventricles, resulting from inflammation surrounding the penetrating venules. 

Dawson fingers in multiple sclerosis: Parasagittal FLAIR 
shows numerous foci of T2 
prolongation (arrows) within 
the corpus callosum that 
point towards the ventricle in a patient with relapsing-remitting MS. 
• 
The central vein sign describes the presence of a central vein within the white matter lesion, identified as a central hypointensity surrounded by hyperintensity on FLAIR images, is relatively specific for MS-related white matter lesions. 

• 
There are many recent advances to imaging of MS beyond the use of gadolinium-enhancement as a surrogate for active inflammation. Leptomeningeal enhancement is emerging as an imaging biomarker for active inflammation. This utilizes the emerging idea of immune cell infiltrates, indicative of active demyelination, are present in the leptomeninges. 

• 
Although spinal involvement is not required for diagnosis, MS involves the spinal cord in a substantial minority of patients, with the cervical spine cord most frequently involved. Isolated spinal cord involvement is seen in up to 20% of cases of MS. Spinal MS involvement 


is usually short-segment and unilateral. 
• 
Lesions that are dark on T1-weighted images are called “black holes” and are associated with more severe demyelination and axonal loss. 

• 
Chronic MS leads to cortical atrophy and thinning of the corpus callosum. MR spectroscopy can mimic high grade glioma, with i NAA and h choline. 

• 
Tumefactive MS describes the occasionally seen ring enhancement and mass-like 


appearance of an active MS plaque. In contrast to a brain tumor, the demyelinating lesion 
will not have any significant mass effect, and the ring of enhancement is usually incomplete. 

Enhancing tumefactive lesion in the same patient as the previous page, with known MS: Axial post-contrast T1­
weighted image shows a ring-enhancing lesion in the right middle-cerebellar peduncle (arrow). 
Although ring enhancement 
is nonspecific, the lack of any appreciable mass effect (the adjacent fourth ventricle is normal in size and shape) suggests a demyelinating 
lesion. 

Concentric (Balo) sclerosis 
• Concentric (Balo) sclerosis is a very rare variant of MS with pathognomonic alternating concentric bands of normal and abnormal myelin. It is seen more often in younger patients. 
Marburg variant (acute multiple sclerosis) 
• Marburg variant of MS is a fulminant manifestation of MS, leading to death within months. 
NMO spectrum disease 
• 
NMO spectrum disease (NMOSD) (previously described as Devic disease or NMO) is a demyelinating disease, distinct from MS, which involves both the optic nerves and spinal cord. NMOSD confers a worse prognosis compared to MS. 

• 
NMO-IgG, an antibody to aquaporin 4, is highly specific for NMOSD. NMO-IgG activates the complement cascade and induces demyelination. 

• 
Imaging findings are discussed in more detail in the “Spine” chapter. 


Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) 
• 
Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a monophasic demyelinating disorder seen primarily in children that typically occurs after a viral infection or vaccination. The majority of patients make a full recovery, but a minority suffer permanent neurologic sequelae. 

• 
Imaging findings can be identical to MS, and occasionally cases of presumed ADEM will be reclassified as MS due to polyphasic clinical course. Similar to MS, ADEM may involve the 


brain, brainstem, or spinal cord. 
• 
Optic neuritis and spinal cord involvement can be seen in ADEM, as with MS. 

• 
The Hurst variant (acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis) is a rapidly fulminant form of ADEM that leads to death within days. 


Imaging of the Hurst variant shows multifocal T2 prolongation and associated white matter hemorrhage, which may appear as confluent hematomas. 


Vascular white matter disease 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) 

PRES: Axial FLAIR images show abnormal hyperintense signal in the subcortical white matter of the bilateral 
posterior frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, as well as bilateral cerebellar hemispheres. 
• 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a disorder of vasogenic edema with a posterior circulation predominance triggered by failed autoregulation and resultant hyperperfusion, most commonly caused by acute hypertension. In addition to hypertension, PRES is also associated with eclampsia, sepsis, autoimmune disorders, multi-drug chemotherapy, and solid or stem cell transplantation. 

• 
In contrast to infarction, the edema is vasogenic in etiology, not cytotoxic. Diffusion may be normal, increased, or restricted. 

• 
Imaging shows symmetric regions of subcortical white matter abnormality (hypoattenuation on CT and T2 prolongation on MR), especially in the posterior circulation (occipital and parietal lobes and posterior fossa). Mild mass effect and enhancement can be seen. 


Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) 
• 
CADASIL is an inherited disease (notch3 mutation) characterized by recurrent stroke, migraine, subcortical dementia, and pseudobulbar palsy, due to small vessel arteriopathy. 

• 
The clinical hallmark of CADASIL is recurrent episodes of stroke or transient ischemic attacks, which are nearly always found to be subcortical in the white matter or basal ganglia on imaging. There is often associated migraine. It may eventually lead to dementia. 

• 
MRI shows symmetric foci of T2 prolongation in the subcortical white matter, which may become confluent as the disease progresses. Anterior temporal lobe or paramedian frontal lobe foci of T2 prolongation are highly sensitive and specific for CADASIL, especially with clinical history of migraine. Although the symmetric subcortical pattern is similar to PRES, the distribution in CADASIL is anterior circulation. 


Vasculitis 
• 
CNS vasculitis is a group of vascular inflammatory disorders that primarily affect the small vessels, in particular the leptomeningeal and small parenchymal vessels. 

• 
Etiologies include lupus, polyarteritis nodosa, giant cell arteritis, and Sjögren syndrome. 

• 
MRI shows numerous small focal areas of T2 prolongation in subcortical and deep white matter. Although the appearance may be similar to MS, foci of hemorrhage (best seen on GRE or SWI) may be present in vasculitis, which would not be seen in MS. 

• 
Vascular imaging (CT angiography and catheter angiography are more sensitive than MRI 

angiography) shows a beaded, irregular appearance to the cerebral vessels. Neuro Brain: 734 

• 
Microangiopathy describes age-related chronic axonal loss, gliosis, and ischemic changes seen in up to 80% of elderly individuals. Microangiopathy never involves the corpus callosum: If involvement of the corpus callosum is present, an alternative diagnosis should be considered, such as MS or neoplasm. 

• 
Binswanger disease represents the combination of dementia and severe microangiopathy. 




Infectious (viral) white matter disease 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) 

Axial FLAIR images at three different levels show asymmetric multifocal FLAIR hyperintense white matter lesions involving the right frontal lobe subcortical U-fibers (left image, arrows), left temporal lobe (middle image), left cerebellum and brainstem (right image). The lesions demonstrate restricted diffusion and lack of enhancement (not shown). This patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and immunosuppression from rituximab prescribed for pemphigoid. JC virus was detected in CSF sample by PCR. 
• 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a demyelinating disease of immunocompromised patients caused by reactivation of JC virus. There is progressive demyelination with lack of inflammatory response. 

• 
PML occurs most commonly in AIDS patients (PML is an AIDS defining illness), but can also be seen in patients with malignancy, status post-organ transplant, or with autoimmune disorders. Approximately 1 in 1,000 patients with MS treated with natalizumab (Tysabri) may have superimposed PML and it may be difficult to distinguish between MS and PML. Diagnosis is made by PCR for JC virus DNA in CSF. 

• MR imaging of PML shows asymmetric multifocal white matter lesions that may become confluent. There is rarely mass effect or enhancement. The arcuate (subcortical U) fibers are typically involved. Arcuate fibers are myelinated tracts at the gray-white junction that connect cortex to cortex. 

• 
In an AIDS patient, the primary differential for white matter lesions is PML and HIV encephalitis. In contrast to PML, HIV encephalitis is usually bilateral (and symmetric), spares the subcortical white matter, and is associated with cerebral atrophy: 


Diffuse bilateral involvement, sparing of subcortical white matter, and cerebral atrophy • HIV encephalitis. Asymmetric signal, involvement of subcortical white matter, hypointensity on T1-weighted images, peripheral DWI hyperintensity, and lack of atrophy during acute phase g PML. However, progressive cerebral atrophy can be seen in late stage PML. 
• 
Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a demyelinating disease caused by reactivation of measles virus, usually after a long latent period. 

• 
Imaging shows periventricular white matter lesions, but in distinction to the other white matter entities, SSPE lesions tend to have surrounding edema and mass effect. 



Iatrogenic white matter disease 
Radiation injury 
Whole brain radiation injury 

White matter radiation injury: Axial FLAIR image shows extensive confluent T2 prolongation within most of the visualized white matter. The patient had a remote history of whole brain radiation therapy 
for a high-grade glioma. 
• 
Radiation injury related to whole brain radiation therapy has three distinct patterns, characterized by the timing of presentation and timing of radiation. 

• 
The acute phase occurs during or immediately after radiation therapy, thought to reflect edema due to endothelial injury. It may present as diffuse T2 prolongation in the white matter. Clinically patients can present with acute encephalopathy with signs of increased intracranial pressure. This is usually self-limited or improved with dexamethasone. 

• 
The early delayed phase occurs between several weeks and up to 6 months after treatment, and is thought to be due to demyelination. MRI findings can vary from white matter T2 prolongation in the field of radiation to increase in size of contrast-enhancing lesions within the radiation field. In whole brain radiation, the changes are most pronounced in the periventricular regions. 


• The late delayed phase is most commonly seen with SRS. It can start as early as 6 months, most commonly between 9 to 15 months, and sometimes years after radiation. Late effects are typically irreversible and histologically are due to vascular changes including coagulative necrosis and include white matter changes, radionecrosis, and vascular lesions.  Radiation necrosis typically occurs weeks to months after radiation, with 80% of cases occurring within three years of completion of radiotherapy. Imaging demonstrates a peripherally enhancing, centrally necrotic lesion. Treatment is usually corticosteroids. 
Other effects include mineralizing microangiopathy which occurs more than 6 months after radiation and 
presents as calcification in the basal ganglia or dentate nuclei. It is more common in children than adults. Radiation vasculitis can occur in large vessels, and can present as focal narrowed segments on angiogram. Involvement of distal internal carotid arteries can result in a moyamoya phenomenon. 
Other vascular lesions such as capillary telangiectasis or cavernous malformations can be seen. 
• 
A treatment-related phenomenon that mimics tumor progression after targeted radiation and chemotherapy is termed pseudoprogression. 

• 
In patients who are receiving standard concomitant radiation with temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide, pseudoprogression peaks after 3–6 months of therapy and rarely occurs after 6 months. 

• 
Pseudoprogression presents as transient contrast enhancement and edema on imaging 


which subsequently resolves on follow-up scans without treatment. Appropriate recognition of pseudoprogression is important to prevent early discontinuation of adjuvant 
chemotherapy. 
• 
The incidence of pseudoprogression is an active area of research, however some reports suggest that pseudoprogression may occur more frequently in patients who harbor a MGMT promoter methylation status. 

• 
Currently, no imaging techniques can reliably differentiate between pseudoprogression and early progressive disease. Techniques that have been investigated include diffusion-weighted MRI (lower mean ADC values and ADC ratios associated with progressive disease) and MR perfusion (higher relative cerebral blood volume associated with progressive disease) are limited due to confounding by necrosis and vascular leakage which may underestimate rCBV. FDG-PET is widely available however has an unacceptably low sensitivity and specificity. Novel tracers such as FET-PET, FDOPA-PET, 13N-NH3 PET are under investigation. 


Stereotactic radiosurgery 
• 
Stereotactic radiation therapy is the delivery of highly focused radiation to a target, and when completed in a single fraction is called radiosurgery. 

• 
Transient increase in size of the lesion can occur 3–12 months after radiosurgery, and usually subsides without treatment. 

• 
Radiation necrosis occurs later after completion of treatment, typically 9–12 months after therapy, rarely occurs before 6 months and does not subside without treatment. 

• 
Perfusion MRI has been proven to be useful in distinguishing recurrent metastasis from radiation necrosis. The percentage of signal recovery computed from comparing 


enhancement at one hour from peak enhancement of a region of interest has been shown 
to have a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 100% for radiation necrosis. However, this technique requires perfusion imaging times of up to an hour which can be logistically difficult. 

Chemotherapy-related white matter disease 
• 
Chemotherapy may cause focal, multifocal, or diffuse white matter disease, especially in combination with radiation treatment. 

• 
Methotrexate toxicity is discussed in the toxic/metabolic section later in the chapter.
