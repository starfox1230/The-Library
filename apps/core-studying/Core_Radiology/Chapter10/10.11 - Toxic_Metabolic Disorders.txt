Toxic/metabolic disorders 
Metabolic Disorders 
Wernicke encephalopathy 

Wernicke encephalopathy: FLAIR images show T2 prolongation involving the thalami, caudate nuclei, inferior hypothalamus, mammillary bodies, and periaqueductal gray matter (arrows). 
• Wernicke encephalopathy is an acute syndrome of ataxia, confusion, and oculomotor 
dysfunction, caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. This is most frequently seen in patients with alcoholism or other causes of secondary malnutrition, such as hyperemesis, eating disorders, and bariatric surgery. 
• On imaging, the affected areas demonstrate symmetric bilateral hyperintensity on FLAIR, restricted diffusion, and contrast enhancement in up to 50% of cases. The most frequently affected areas are the medial thalami, the mammillary bodies, hypothalamus, tectal plate and periaqueductal gray matter. 
Parathyroid dysfunction disorders 
• Parathyroid hypofunction disorders include hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism, which can be 
distinguished based on clinical and laboratory findings. 
• 
Hyperparathyroidism can be caused by a parathyroid adenoma or parathyroid hyperplasia. 

• 
The main imaging findings are the same for all conditions and characterized by coarse 


calcium deposition in the basal ganglia. CT shows coarse, bilateral and symmetric calcifications in the globi pallidi, putamina, and caudate nuclei. MR images depict expected findings associated with calcifications in all sequences – hyperintensity on T1­
weighted images, hypointensity on T2-weighted images, and blooming artifacts on T2*- or susceptibility-
weighted images 
The thalami, subcortical white matter, and dentate nuclei may also be affected. 
• Important differential to consider is Fahr disease, which is a genetic condition characterized by idiopathic, bilateral basal ganglia calcifications. Fahr disease is not associated with laboratory abnormalities, unlike the parathyroid dysfunction disorders. 

Axial noncontrast T1-weighted MRI shows intrinsic 
T1 hyperintensity in bilateral globi pallidi (arrows) in 
a patient with chronic liver disease. 
• 
Chronic hepatic encephalopathy is a reversible clinical syndrome seen in patients with chronic liver disease, frequently with portal hypertension or portosystemic shunting. 

• 
Clinical presentation can vary from subtle cognitive impairment to more acute presentations of cognitive dysfunction during acute decompensation. 

• 
The characteristic imaging finding is symmetric hyperintensity on T1-weighted imaging of the globi pallidi and substantia nigrae, thought to be due to manganese accumulation. 

• 
Acute hepatic encephalopathy or hyperammonemic encephalopathy is primarily caused by 


hyperammonemia, and is seen in acute liver failure. 
• 
Characteristic imaging features of hyperammonemic encephalopathy include restricted diffusion accompanied by FLAIR hyperintensity symmetrically and bilaterally involving the insular and cingulate gyri, with relative sparing of the occipital lobes and perirolandic region. 

• 
Recurrent alterations in ammonia levels, occurring in frequent acute on chronic liver failure presentations, can also result in chronic accumulation of glutamine, which may manifest as elevated glutamine-glutamate peak on MR spectroscopy. 


Uremic encephalopathy 
• 
Uremic encephalopathy occurs in acute and chronic renal failure as a result of excessive uremic toxins. 

• 
Clinically patients present with neurologic symptoms, such as movement disorders, impaired mental status, cognitive disorders, and seizures. 

• 
The most common imaging pattern is bilateral symmetric involvement of the basal ganglia with variable involvement of the white matter. 

• 
The lentiform fork sign can be seen in patients with concurrent metabolic acidosis, characterized by FLAIR hyperintensity involving the white matter surrounding the lentiform 


nuclei, outlining the lateral and medial boundaries of the putamina. 
Hypoglycemic encephalopathy 
• The most common imaging finding is symmetric FLAIR hyperintensity with associated restricted diffusion affecting the gray matter in the parieto-occipital and temporal regions, with relative sparing of the thalami, white matter and cerebellum. Basal ganglia involvement 
can be seen and is associated with a poor prognosis. 
• 
Diabetic striatopathy, also known as hyperglycemia-induced hemichorea-hemiballismus, is a condition clinically manifest by involuntary, non-patterned movements. 

• 
It is most frequently seen in type 2 diabetic patients and is a complication of nonketotic hyperglycemia. 

• 
Imaging findings are pathognomonic, characterized by unilateral hyperintensity of the striatum on T1-weighted imaging and corresponding hyperdensity on CT. 

• 
The clinical and imaging findings are reversible in most patients. 


Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) 

Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy: Axial FLAIR (left image) shows symmetrical T2 prolongation in the bilateral putamina, heads of the caudate nuclei, and to a lesser extent in the globi pallidi. There is subtle FLAIR hyperintensity of the entire cortical ribbon. DWI (right image) shows marked DWI hyperintensity within the 
globi pallidi (arrows). 
• 
Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in adults is caused by circulatory or respiratory failure, leading to global hypoxia/anoxia. 

• 
Severe HIE typically affects the gray matter, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampi, and basal ganglia. This distribution is similar to that of severe hypoglycemia. Involvement of the 


basal ganglia portends a worse prognosis. 
• 
MR imaging shows FLAIR and/or DWI hyperintensity of the affected regions. 

• 
On CT, there is loss of gray-white differentiation, diffuse cerebral hypoattenuation, and sulcal effacement. The white cerebellum sign describes the typical sparing of the cerebellum, which appears relatively hyperattenuating compared to the affected supratentorial brain. 


Methanol poisoning 
• 
Methanol poisoning causes severe metabolic acidosis. Patients present with visual and gastrointestinal symptoms with rapid progression to a comatose state. 

• 
Selective hemorrhagic necrosis of the putamina with relative sparing of the globi pallidi is the most characteristic imaging feature. Variable degrees of subcortical white matter, cerebellum, optic nerve necrosis may also be seen. 

• 
Restricted diffusion can be seen in the acute phase. MR spectroscopy shows reduced NAA and elevated lactate peaks. 



FLAIR (left image) and DWI (right image) show symmetric T2 prolongation and restricted diffusion involving bilateral globi pallidi, strongly favoring a toxic metabolic etiology such as carbon monoxide poisoning. 
• 
Carbon monoxide is an odorless and colorless gas which has a higher affinity to hemoglobin than oxygen and results in impaired oxygen transportation. 

• 
Bilateral, symmetric, necrosis of the globi pallidi is the hallmark imaging feature, resulting in hyperintensity with hypointense rim on FLAIR with restricted diffusion and hypointensity on susceptibility-weighted sequences. 

• 
Less common sites of involvement include the hippocampi, caudate nuclei, putamina, thalami, cerebellum, corpus callosum, cerebral cortex or white matter. 


Osmotic demyelination 

Central pontine myelinolysis: Axial FLAIR image demonstrates T2 prolongation in the central pons with associated mild restricted diffusion (not shown), in this patient with history of alcohol use 
disorder who presented with hyponatremia. 
• Osmotic demyelination is caused by a rapid change in extracellular osmolality, typically occurring after aggressive correction of hyponatremia. The quick osmotic gradient change causes endothelial damage, blood-brain barrier breakdown, and release of extracellular toxins which damage myelin. 
• 
Patients with poor nutritional status, including alcoholics, chronic lung disease patients, and liver transplant recipients, are the most susceptible to osmotic demyelination. 

• 
Osmotic demyelination is most frequently seen in the pons, hence the entity was classically called central pontine myelinolysis. However, in up to 50% of cases, extrapontine lesions are also seen. MRI features include bilateral central T2 prolongation in the affected region. The most commonly involved extrapontine sites include the thalami, basal ganglia, and hemispheric white matter, frequently symmetric. 



Axial FLAIR (left image) shows T2 prolongation in the corpus callosum with symmetric extension into the bilateral pericallosal white matter. There is associated restricted diffusion on DWI (right image). Findings are thought to represent Marchiafava-Bignami disorder. 
• 
Marchiafava-Bignami disease (MBD) is characterized by demyelination and subsequent necrosis of the corpus callosum. 

• 
It is primarily associated with chronic alcohol use and vitamin B complex deficiency. 

• Clinically patients can present acutely, with seizures or in a comatose state with progression to death within several days, or with a subacute/chronic presentation with mild encephalopathy. 

• 
MBD can be accompanied by other alcohol-related conditions, such as Wernicke encephalopathy. 




Drug-induced toxicity 
Metronidazole-induced brain toxicity 

Metronidazole toxicity in patient with altered mental status and new onset movement disorder following recent metronidazole treatment: Axial FLAIR images show symmetric hyperintensity in bilateral dentate nuclei (left image, arrows) and splenium of the corpus callosum (right image, arrow). 
• Metronidazole is an antibiotic used to treat both bacterial and protozoal infections. Rarely, it can cause CNS toxic effects. While this occurs most frequently in patients with prolonged treatment courses (>25 days), it has also been described in patients with much shorter 
courses. 
• 
Clinically, patients present with cerebellar dysfunction, altered mental status, and seizures. 

• 
Characteristic imaging findings include symmetric hyperintensity on FLAIR of the cerebellar dentate nuclei, splenium of the corpus callosum, tegmentum, dorsal pons, and dorsal medulla. 


Methotrexate-induced brain toxicity 

Methotrexate toxicity in a patient receiving intrathecal methotrexate for lymphoblastic lymphoma who presented with left arm weakness: DWI (left image) and ADC map (right) show focal decreased diffusivity within the left perirolandic white matter involving the cortical spinal tracts. 
• 
The most characteristic imaging finding is bilateral, asymmetric white matter lesions with diffusion restriction and associated FLAIR hyperintensity affecting the centrum semiovale, crossing vascular territories with relative sparing of subcortical U fibers. 

• 
In more severe cases of necrotizing encephalopathy, peripheral enhancement can be seen with confluent adjacent vasogenic edema, and can demonstrate a tumorlike pattern. 

• 
Unlike malignancy, these lesions and enhancement disappear without treatment.
