Imaging of stroke 
Determine potential candidate for therapy 
• 
The goal of stroke imaging is to determine who would benefit from therapy. 

• 
The goal of stroke therapy is to restore perfusion to the brain. 

• 
In the appropriate patients, intravenous or intra-arterial thrombolysis, performed most commonly with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA, alteplase), can improve outcomes. However, there is risk of fatal hemorrhage in patients inappropriately selected for therapy. The exact exclusion criteria to administer tPA varies among institutions. 

• 
The American Heart Association (AHA) and American Stroke Association (ASA) published guidelines for early management of adults with ischemic stroke (Stroke, 2019) and 


established recommendations for imaging and treatment of acute stroke. All patients with suspected acute stroke should receive emergency brain imaging prior to initiation of any thrombolytic therapy to evaluate for intracerebral hemorrhage. Both noncontrast CT and MRI, when gradient echo sequences are used, are effective in ruling out intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) prior to tPA 
administration. In many patients, the diagnosis of ischemic stroke can be made on the basis of clinical presentation and noncontrast head CT alone. In patients with unclear last known normal, MRI can be useful in identifying diffusion-positive, FLAIR-
negative lesions to select patients who may benefit from IV tPA (<4.5 hours from symptom recognition). Advanced imaging including CT angiogram with perfusion or MR angiogram with diffusion-weighted 
imaging with or without MR perfusion is recommended for selecting candidates for mechanical thrombectomy in the late window (=6 hours after last known normal). In patients being considered for mechanical thrombectomy, imaging of extracranial carotid and vertebral 
arteries is reasonable for determining patient eligibility and for endovascular procedural planning. 
• Some institutions add additional exclusion criteria for administration of intravenous tPA, 
although these additional criteria are not a part of the AHA guidelines: Individuals with a large (greater than 1/3 MCA territory) infarct may be excluded from IV tPA. Occlusion of the distal internal carotid artery and proximal MCA and ACA (a T-shaped occlusion) may 
preclude treatment with IV tPA. Absence of a penumbra (discussed below) of salvageable brain that represents at least 20% of the region of abnormal perfusion may preclude treatment with IV tPA. 
Perfusion stroke imaging 
• Perfusion imaging with CT angiogram or MR angiogram is recommended in patients presenting between 6 and 24 hours after last-known normal with suspected large vessel occlusion (LVO) in the anterior circulation who may benefit from mechanical thrombectomy. 
LVO is defined as thrombosis involving the intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) or the M1 segment of the MCA. Some clinical trials also included ACA and/or M2 occlusion. 
• 
Two randomized trials (DAWN and DEFUSE 3) have shown a benefit in revascularization of patients with acute ischemic stroke with LVO presenting beyond 6 hours of last known normal using diffusion or perfusion imaging selection parameters. 

• 
Perfusion imaging parameters are used to quantify the core and penumbra. However, diffusion-weighted imaging is the gold standard for quantifying core size. 


The infarct core is the hypoperfused tissue with low cerebral blood flow which would not be salvageable regardless of subsequent reperfusion. The ischemic penumbra is the tissue “at risk” which has the potential to recover if perfusion is achieved. 
• The DAWN and DEFUSE 3 trials have led to implementation of perfusion imaging in routine acute stroke evaluation to identify patients who could benefit from mechanical thrombectomy with an expanded time window. 
The DAWN trial used a combination of the age-adjusted NIH stroke scale score and the core infarct size from CT perfusion or MR DWI (clinical-core mismatch) as an eligibility criterion to select patients with anterior circulation LVO for thrombectomy between 6-24 hours of last known normal, and demonstrated an overall benefit in functional outcome in the intervention group. 
The DEFUSE 3 trial used a discrepancy between the penumbra and the ischemic core (perfusion-core 
mismatch) and maximum core size as imaging criteria to select patients with anterior circulation LVO between 6-16 hours from last known normal for mechanical thrombectomy. The trial showed a benefit in functional outcome at 90 days in the intervention group. 

Acute stroke: Perfusion imaging 
• Important hemodynamic parameters calculated from a perfusion study are listed below: Cerebral blood volume (CBV): Blood volume per unit brain tissue (mL/100 g). Cerebral blood flow (CBF): Volume of blood flowing per unit brain tissue per minute (mL/100 g/min). Mean transit time (MTT): Average time (sec) for contrast bolus to transverse a voxel. Time to maximum (Tmax) or time to peak (TTP): Time (sec) from scan start to maximum intensity of 
contrast bolus in voxel. Delay time (DT) and time to drain (TTD) are similar measurements. 
• CBF, CBV, and MTT are related by the central volume equation: 
cerebral blood flow (CBF) = cerebral blood volume (CBV) / mean transit time (MTT) 
• 
The infarct core and ischemic penumbra can be estimated from the imaging parameters, for which specific thresholds have been established in recent clinical trials to more accurately differentiate and quantify the two tissue types. Automated perfusion post-processing softwares are also available to aid interpretation. 

• 
The exact perfusion thresholds differ by software vendor and are evolving as new clinical trials are carried out. Also, the thresholds pertain to the anterior circulation only. Utility of perfusion imaging in posterior circulation strokes is still undergoing investigation. 


Traditional perfusion maps  Thresholds used in automated CT perfusion softwares  
Infarct core  Markedly decreased CBF, matched by decreased CBV  Defined by CBF <30–45% depending on software  
Ischemic penumbra  Mildly decreased CBF, mismatched by increased or normal CBV Increased MTT and Tmax  Defined by Tmax >6 sec, or DT >3 sec  


CBF CBV TTD, similar to Tmax 
Color perfusion maps show focal region of markedly decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) and matched markedly reduced cerebral blood volume (CBV) in the left frontal lobe, corresponding to infarcted tissue (yellow arrows). There is a larger area of penumbra (white boxes) in the left ACA and MCA territories that demonstrates mildly reduced CBF, increased CBV, and prolonged time to drain (TTD). 
• Noncontrast CT is frequently the initial test of evaluation for patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke, as described above, to evaluate for the presence of intracerebral 
hemorrhage. 

• 
Noncontrast CT in the hyperacute stage is relatively insensitive to detect early infarction compared to MRI. Subtle loss of gray-white differentiation in the insula or basal ganglia may be present on CT, thought to be due to decreased cerebral blood volume. 

• 
The insular ribbon sign describes the loss of gray-white differentiation in the insula. The gray-white junction becomes most conspicuous at very narrow stroke windows (window 40/ level 40).

right MCA infarction: 
Axial noncontrast CT shows subtle loss of the gray-white 
differentiation in the insular 
cortex (yellow arrows). 
Gray-white differentiation is preserved on the normal left 
side. 

• Obscuration of the lentiform nucleus (putamen and globus pallidus) is caused by loss of gray-white differentiation at the border of the lentiform nucleus and the posterior limb of the internal capsule. 
• The hyperdense artery sign describes direct visualization of the acute intravascular thrombus, most commonly seen in the MCA. The hyperdense artery sign is specific for ischemia when seen, but relatively insensitive (seen in approximately 1/3 of cases). Some authors suggest that the presence of the hyperdense artery sign portends a worse prognosis.

• Detailed MR imaging of the multiple temporal stages of stroke is discussed on the following pages. For the initial evaluation, diffusion sequences can detect acute infarction with high sensitivity within minutes of symptom onset. DWI is more sensitive than FLAIR in the detection of hyperacute stroke. 


Evolution of infarction 

Hyperacute infarct (0–6 hours) 
• Within minutes of critical ischemia, the sodium-potassium ATPase pump that maintains the normal low intracellular sodium concentration fails. Sodium and water diffuse into cells, 
leading to cell swelling and cytotoxic edema. 

• 
Calcium also diffuses into cells, which triggers cascades that contribute to cell lysis. 

• 
By far the most sensitive imaging modality for detection of hyperacute infarct is MRI diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). DWI hyperintensity and ADC map hypointensity reflect reduced diffusivity, which can be seen within minutes of the ictus. 

• 
Diffusion is reduced in an acute infarct by two factors: 

1) Shift from extracellular to intracellular water due to Na/K ATPase pump failure. 
2) Increased viscosity of infarcted brain due to cell lysis and increased extracellular protein. 

• 
FLAIR may be normal. Subtle hyperintensity may be seen on FLAIR images in the hyperacute stage. These changes are seen less than 2/3 of the time within the first 6 hours. 

• 
Perfusion shows decreased cerebral blood volume of the infarct core, with or without a surrounding region of decreased cerebral blood flow, which represents the penumbra. 

• 
The acute infarct phase is characterized by increase in vasogenic edema and mass effect. 

• 
Damaged vascular endothelial cells cause leakage of extracellular fluid and increase the risk of hemorrhage. 

• 
On imaging, there is increased sulcal effacement and mass effect. The mass effect peaks at 3–4 days, which is an overlap time between the acute and early subacute phases. 

• 
MRI shows hyperintensity of the infarct core on T2-weighted images, best seen on FLAIR. The FLAIR abnormality is usually confined to the gray matter. DWI continues to show restricted diffusion. 

• 
There may be some arterial enhancement, due to increased collateral flow. 

• 
Perfusion images most commonly show increase in size of the infarct core with resultant decrease in size of the penumbra. 


Early subacute infarct (1.5 days–5 days) 
• 
In the early subacute phase, blood flow to the affected brain is re-established by leptomeningeal collaterals and ingrowth of new vessels into the region of infarction. 

• 
The new vessels have an incomplete blood-brain barrier, causing a continued increase in vasogenic edema and mass effect, which peaks at 3–4 days. 

• 
MR imaging shows marked hyperintensity on T2-weighted images involving both gray and white matter (in contrast to the acute stage which usually involves just the gray matter). 

• 
The ADC map becomes less dark or even resolves if there is extensive edema; however, the DWI images typically remain bright due to underlying T2 shine-through. 

• 
Perfusion imaging shows continued expansion of the infarct core and further reduction in the ischemic penumbra. 


Late subacute infarct (5 days–2 weeks) 
• 
The late subacute phase is characterized by resolution of vasogenic edema and reduction in mass effect. 

• 
A key imaging finding is gyriform enhancement, which may occasionally be confused for a neoplasm. Unlike a tumor, however, a subacute infarction will not have mass effect. Enhancement can be seen from approximately 6 days to 6 weeks after the initial infarct. 


The enhancement of a subacute infarct has also been described by the “2-2-2” rule, which states that 
enhancement begins at 2 days, peaks at 2 weeks, and disappears by 2 months. 
• DWI may remain bright due to T2 shine-through, although the ADC map will either return to normal or show increased diffusivity. 
Chronic infarct 
• 
In the chronic stage of infarction, cellular debris and dead brain tissue are removed by macrophages and replaced by cystic encephalomalacia and gliosis. 

• 
Infarct involvement of the corticospinal tract may cause mass effect, mild hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, and eventual atrophy of the ipsilateral cerebral peduncle and ventral pons due to Wallerian degeneration. These changes can first be seen in the subacute phase, 


with atrophy being the predominant feature in the chronic stage. 
• 
DWI has usually returned to normal in the chronic stage. 

• 
Occasionally, cortical laminar necrosis can develop instead of encephalomalacia. Cortical laminar necrosis is a histologic finding characterized by deposition of lipid-laden macrophages after ischemia that manifests on imaging as hyperintensity on both T1- and 


T2-weighted images.
