Intraparenchymal hemorrhage 
Imaging of hemorrhage 
CT imaging of hemorrhage 
• Noncontrast CT is usually the first imaging study performed in the emergency setting for a patient with a sudden neurologic deficit, headache, seizure, or altered level of 
consciousness. 
• CT is highly sensitive for detection of hyperacute/acute intracranial hemorrhage, which 
appears hyperattenuating relative to brain parenchyma and CSF. Acute hemorrhage may be nearly isoattenuating to water in severe anemia (hemoglobin <8 mg/dL). 
• The CT angiographic (CTA) spot sign describes the presence of small enhancing focus or foci 
within an acute intracerebral hemorrhage on CTA, which is separate from adjacent vessels and is not seen on noncontrast CT. This is thought to represent active hemorrhage and is a 
predictor of hematoma expansion and poor clinical outcome. 

Angiographic spot sign: Axial noncontrast CT (left image) demonstrates a left frontal acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage (yellow arrow). Axial CTA (right image) shows a hyperdense focus at the periphery of the 
intraparenchymal hematoma that does not communicate with any vessels and is not present on the noncontrast images, compatible with active hemorrhage (red arrow). 
MR imaging of hemorrhage 
• MR imaging of hemorrhage is complex. The characteristics of blood products change on T1- and T2-weighted sequences as the iron in hemoglobin evolves through physiologic stages: 
Intracellular oxyhemoglobin • deoxygenation • Intracellular deoxyhemoglobin • oxidation • Intracellular methemoglobin • cell lysis • Extracellular methemoglobin • chelation • Hemosiderin and ferritin 
• 
Each stage of this evolution adheres to a reasonably constant time course in the intra-axial space and allows the radiologist to “date” the hemorrhage based on the unique signal characteristics on T1- and T2-weighted images for each stage. 

• 
In general, all stages of hemorrhage are isointense or slightly dark on T1-weighted images, except for the methemoglobin stages, which are bright. 

• 
Methemoglobin is bright on both T1- and T2-weighted images, except for intracellular methemoglobin, which is dark on T2-weighted images. 


• In general, non-hyperacute hemorrhage is dark on T2-weighted images, with the exception of extracellular methemoglobin, which is hyperintense on T2-weighted images. A hyperacute hematoma, containing primarily oxyhemoglobin, is slightly hyperintense on T2­
weighted images but features a characteristic dark rim representing deoxygenation at the 
periphery of the clot. 
• The inherent slight hyperintensity of oxygenated blood on T2-weighted images becomes 
apparent in slow flow states, as seen in venous hypertension and moyamoya disease. Slowly flowing blood is not susceptible to the flow-void artifact and the resultant apparently “enhancing” vasculature really represents unmasking of the normal blood signal. 
• The expected evolution of blood products is highly dependent on macrophage elimination of blood breakdown products. These rules of thumb are not applicable to extra-axial blood 
and timing is generally not given for extra-axial blood, such as a subdural hematoma. 
Treatment of hemorrhage 
• 
In most cases, imaging is performed to evaluate for a treatable cause of hemorrhage, such as AVM or aneurysm. The mainstay of treatment of intraparenchymal hemorrhage is supportive, including blood pressure control and normalization of any coagulopathy. 

• 
Larger hemorrhages can be evacuated surgically if there is significant mass effect or risk of herniation. In particular, a hemorrhage >3 cm in the posterior fossa would generally be 


treated surgically as there is increased risk of brainstem compression or hydrocephalus from 
fourth ventricular obstruction. 



Specific stages of parenchymal hematoma on MR 

Hyperacute hematoma (<6 hours): Intracellular oxyhemoglobin 
• 
A few hours after red cell extravasation, a hyperacute hematoma is primarily composed of intact red cells containing oxygenated hemoglobin, which is diamagnetic. 

• 
The center of the hematoma will be isointense on T1-weighted images and iso- to slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted images. 

• 
The key imaging finding of a hyperacute hematoma is a peripheral rim of hypointensity on T2-weighted images due to deoxygenation of the most peripheral red cells. This peripheral dark rim is most conspicuous on GRE sequences. 

• 
After the red cells desaturate (lose oxygen), the entire hematoma becomes hypointense on T2-weighted images and iso- to mildly hypointense on T1-weighted images. 


Early subacute hematoma (3 days to 1 week): Intracellular methemoglobin 
• The subacute phase is characterized by methemoglobin, which is paramagnetic and undergoes proton-electron dipole-dipole interactions (PEDDI) with water. PEDDI shortens T1 to cause hyperintensity on T1-weighted images. Intracellular and extracellular 
methemoglobin are both hyperintense on T1-weighted images. 
• In the early subacute phase, blood remains hypointense on T2-weighted images due to the paramagnetic effects of methemoglobin, which remains trapped in the red cells. 
Late subacute hematoma (1 week to months): Extracellular methemoglobin (after RBC lysis) 
• 
The methemoglobin PEDDI effect persists after cell lysis, causing continued hyperintensity on T1-weighted images. 

• 
Paramagnetic effects of methemoglobin lessens. Signal intensity on T2-weighted images increases to that of CSF, due to RBC lysis and decrease in protein concentration. 

• 
There may be peripheral enhancement of a subacute to chronic infarct. 


Chronic sequelae of hemorrhage: Hemosiderin and ferritin 
• 
Salvaged iron atoms are deposited into hemosiderin and ferritin, which become permanently trapped in the brain parenchyma after the blood-brain barrier is restored. 

• 
Susceptibility effects of the stored iron produce characteristic hypointensity on T2-weighted and GRE images. 

• 
Chronic hemorrhage may have peripheral enhancement. 




Non-traumatic causes of intraparenchymal hemorrhage 
Hypertensive hemorrhage 

Hypertensive hemorrhage: Two contiguous noncontrast CT images show a left thalamic hemorrhage (yellow arrow) with extension into the left ventricle occipital horn (red arrows). 
• Chronic hypertension is the most common cause of spontaneous adult intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage and is due to the secondary microangiopathic effects of chronic hypertension. 
• Chronic hypertension causes arteriolar smooth muscle hyperplasia, which eventually leads to smooth muscle death and replacement with collagen. The resultant vascular ectasia predisposes to hemorrhage. 
• 
Hypertensive hemorrhage occurs in characteristic locations in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum. 

• 
In addition to location, imaging (MRI or CT) findings suggestive of a hypertensive bleed include additional stigmata of hypertensive microangiopathy, such as periventricular white matter disease and prior lacunar infarcts. 

• 
An additional MR-specific finding suggesting hypertensive hemorrhage is the presence of microhemorrhages on T2* (GRE or SWI) in the basal ganglia or brainstem. 


Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) 

SWI shows multiple foci of cortical and subcortical susceptibility artifact representing 
microhemorrhages throughout the brain, most prominently seen in the right parietal, temporal, 
and occipital lobes, suggestive of cerebral amyloid 
angiopathy. 
• Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is amyloid accumulated within the walls of small and 
medium arteries, ultimately causing vessel weakness and increased risk of hemorrhage. 
• 
While the spontaneous form of CAA occurs almost exclusively in elderly adults (in which population it is the second most common cause of nontraumatic hemorrhage), a hereditary variant has an earlier age of onset. 

• 
In addition to being a risk factor for hemorrhage, CAA can also occlude the lumens of small vessels and contribute to microangiopathy. 

• 
The main clinical clue that a hemorrhage is secondary to CAA is that the patient is a normotensive elderly adult. 

• 
The primary imaging feature to suggest CAA is the location of hematoma, which is almost always lobar or cortical, usually in the parietal or occipital lobes. 

• 
An important secondary MRI finding is multiple microhemorrhages seen on T2* (GRE or SWI) within the brain parenchyma. In contrast to the microhemorrhages associated with hypertension, CAA microhemorrhages are cortical/subcortical (lobar), not in the basal 


ganglia. 
• In most cases, the clinical or imaging diagnosis of stroke is made before hemorrhagic transformation occurs; however, hemorrhage may occasionally be the presenting feature of 
an infarct. 
• 
More commonly, symptomatic hemorrhage occurs post-infarct in approximately 6–12% of patients receiving thrombolytic therapy. 

• 
Noncontrast CT can identify risk factors for hemorrhagic transformation after thrombolytic therapy, including a relatively large region of hypoattenuation and a dense artery sign. Note that per AHA guidelines, neither of these findings is an exclusion criterion for administration of IV tPA. 


Venous thrombosis 

Hemorrhagic venous infarct: Axial noncontrast CT shows intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left parieto­occipital lobes (left image) and an expanded/hyperdense superior sagittal sinus (middle image, arrow). Axial CTA shows a filling defect in the superior sagittal sinus (empty delta sign; arrow) in keeping with dural venous 
thrombosis. 
• Thrombosis of cortical veins or deep venous sinuses leads to venous hypertension, which may cause infarction and parenchymal hemorrhage. 
Aneurysmal hemorrhage 
• 
As discussed, aneurysmal hemorrhage is by far the most common cause of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. If an intraparenchymal hematoma is due to an aneurysm, the hematoma is usually adjacent to the ruptured aneurysm dome. 

• 
The pattern of subarachnoid blood may help localize the aneurysm; however, if the patient was found down, then the blood will settle in the dependent portion of the brain, confounding localization. 

• 
CT angiography is the study of choice for further evaluation of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. 


Vascular malformations 
• Intraparenchymal hemorrhage from vascular malformations occurs in younger patients (often younger than 50 years) than does hemorrhage secondary to hypertension or cerebral 
amyloid angiopathy. 
• 
Among vascular malformations, the most common cause of intraparenchymal hemorrhage is arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Less common causes are cavernous malformation and dural arteriovenous fistula (dAVF). 

• 
See the preceding section on vascular malformations for imaging description. 

• 
Vasculitis affecting the CNS may be primary or secondary to systemic vasculitides. 

• 
The most common presentation of vasculitis is cerebral ischemia. Less commonly, vasculitis may present with frank hemorrhage. 

• 
Standard MRI imaging shows multiple foci of T2 prolongation in the basal ganglia and subcortical white matter. 

• 
Noninvasive vascular imaging (CTA or MRA) is relatively insensitive to small vessel involvement, but may show irregularity of involved large or medium vessels. 

• 
Angiography is the most sensitive test and shows multifocal areas of stenosis and dilation. 



Hemorrhagic neoplasm 
• 
Occasionally, the initial presentation of a brain tumor may be acute hemorrhage. 

• 
The most common primary brain tumor to cause hemorrhage is glioblastoma. 

• 
There are a relatively limited number of extracranial primary tumors known to cause hemorrhagic metastases, including: 


Melanoma. 
Renal cell carcinoma. Choriocarcinoma. Thyroid carcinoma. Although breast and lung cancer rarely cause hemorrhage on a per-case basis, they are such common 
cancers overall that they can always be considered when a hemorrhagic neoplasm is suspected. 
• 
Patients treated with bevacizumab (trade name Avastin®, Genentech) may be at increased risk for hemorrhagic metastasis. 

• 
Clues to the diagnosis of an underlying tumor causing hemorrhage include more-than­expected edema surrounding a hyperacute hematoma and heterogeneous blood product 


signal, suggesting varying breakdown stages of hemoglobin. 
• 
The presence of multiple enhancing masses strongly suggests metastatic disease. 

• 
In cases where the diagnosis is unclear, a follow-up MRI should be performed once the initial hemorrhage improves. If tumor is present, the MRI may show a delay in the expected evolution of blood products, persistent edema, and enhancement of the underlying tumor. 



Moyamoya: Coronal MIP (maximum intensity projection) reconstruction of a contrast-enhanced MRA of the brain 
shows marked narrowing of the right 
carotid terminus and absence of flow in the right MCA M1 branch (yellow 
arrow), with hypertrophy of the 
ipsilateral lenticulostriate arteries and 
thalamic perforators (red arrows). 
• 
Moyamoya disease is a non-atherosclerotic vasculopathy characterized by progressive stenosis of the intracranial internal carotid arteries and their proximal branches, which leads to compensatory proliferation of fragile collateral vessels, in particular lenticulostriate and other perforating vessels in the basal ganglia. 

• 
When moyamoya vascular findings are associated with a secondary cause such as sickle cell disease, NF1, radiation, Down syndrome, the term moyamoya syndrome is used. 

• 
Angiography of the enlarged lenticulostriate perforating collaterals gives a puff of smoke appearance. 

• 
The ivy sign on FLAIR MRI represents tubular branching hyperintense structures within the sulci, representing cortical arterial branches that appear hyperintense due to slow collateral 

• 
Patients with moyamoya disease are susceptible to aneurysm formation, especially in the posterior circulation. In contrast to children, adult patients with moyamoya disease sometimes present with intraventricular hemorrhage rather than ischemic stroke. 

• 
When severe, moyamoya disease or syndrome can be treated with direct or indirect ECA (most commonly superficial temporal artery) to MCA bypass. Direct bypass is preferred for 


adults and children with a suitable donor artery. 
• Perfusion studies show decreased blood flow to the affected vascular regions.
