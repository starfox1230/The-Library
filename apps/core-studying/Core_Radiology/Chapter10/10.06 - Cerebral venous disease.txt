Cerebral venous disease 
Venous anatomy 

Dural sinuses 
• 
The superior sagittal sinus (and its tributaries) drains the motor and sensory strips. 

• 
The paired transverse sinuses are usually asymmetric, with the left transverse sinus often hypoplastic. 

• 
The sigmoid sinus connects to the jugular bulb. 

• 
The torcular Herophili is the confluence of the superior sagittal sinus, the transverse sinus, and the straight sinus. The word torcular is from the Greek word for wine press, and Herophilus was a Greek anatomist. Technically, the term torcular Herophili refers to the depression on the inner table of the skull produced by the confluence of sinuses, but in general use, torcular Herophili refers to the actual confluence of sinuses. 


Deep cerebral veins 
• 
The deep cerebral veins consist of the paired internal cerebral veins, the basal veins of Rosenthal, and the vein of Galen. 

• 
The venous angle (red dot in the diagram above) is the intersection of the septal vein and the thalamostriate veins. The venous angle is the angiographic landmark for the foramen of Monro. 



Superfi cial cerebral veins 
• 
The vein of Trolard connects superficial cortical veins to the superior sagittal sinus. 

• 
The vein of Labbé drains the temporal convexity into the transverse or sigmoid sinus. Retraction injury to the vein of Labbé during surgery may lead to venous infarction and 


aphasia.

Venous disease 
Venous thrombosis 

Sagittal T1-weighted MRI shows hyperintense thrombus within the superior sagittal sinus (arrows). 



• 
Thrombosis of a cortical vein or a deep venous sinus is one of the more common causes of stroke in younger patients. Risk factors for venous thrombosis include pregnancy, oral contraceptives, thrombophilia, malignancy, and infection. 

• 
A clue to the diagnosis of venous thrombosis on noncontrast CT is increased density within the thrombosed sinus or cortical vein (the cord sign). On contrast-enhanced CT, the empty delta sign signifies a filling defect in the superior sagittal sinus. 

• 
MR venogram will show lack of flow in the thrombosed vein or dural venous sinus. 

• 
Venous thrombosis leads to venous hypertension, which may cause infarction and parenchymal hemorrhage. There are three characteristic patterns of venous infarction, dependent on the location of the thrombosed vein: 


Superior sagittal sinus thrombosis • infarction of the parasagittal high convexity cortex. Deep venous system thrombosis • infarction of the bilateral thalami. Transverse sinus thrombosis • infarction of the posterior temporal lobe.
