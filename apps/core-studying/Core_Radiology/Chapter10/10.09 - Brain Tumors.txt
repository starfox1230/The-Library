Brain tumors 
Approach to evaluation of a focal brain mass lesion 
Are there any tumor-related complications? 
• 
CT is a good screening modality to identify potential surgical emergencies complicating a brain tumor, most commonly the 3 H’s: hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, and herniation. 

• 
Hemorrhage: Tumor neovascularity can be prone to hemorrhage. 


The most common primary brain tumor to hemorrhage is glioblastoma. The most common hemorrhagic metastases include melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, and choriocarcinoma. Although breast and lung cancer metastases are less frequently hemorrhagic on a case-by-case basis, these two malignancies are so common that they should also be considered in the 
differential of a hemorrhagic metastasis. 
• Hydrocephalus: Tumors can block the flow of CSF. 
Tumors within or around the ventricular system, particularly in the posterior cranial fossa, cause noncommunicating hydrocephalus. Leptomeningeal metastases cause communicating hydrocephalus. 
• Herniation: A combination of the tumor and associated vasogenic edema can shift brain tissue across dural reflections. 
Supratentorial tumors cause subfalcine, downward transtentorial (uncal/central), and tonsillar herniation. Infratentorial tumors cause upward transtentorial and tonsillar herniation. 

Could this be a tumor mimic? 
• In the evaluation of any suspected intracranial tumor, non-neoplastic mass-like lesions should also be considered, such as brain abscesses, subacute infarcts, tumefactive demyelination, aneurysms, and developmental or degenerative mass/cystic lesions. These conditions variably show mass effect and/or enhancement, mimicking a brain tumor. 
How many lesions are there? 
• Most primary brain tumors and many brain metastases are solitary. Without a history of cancer, solitary brain tumors in adults over 50 years old have about the same chance to be 
metastasis or glioblastoma.  
• If there is more than one lesion, the diagnosis is most likely to be metastases, but multifocal/multicentric glioblastoma or primary central nervous system lymphoma are in the differential. Some genetic conditions result in multiple brain tumors (e.g., neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis). 

Where is the lesion located? 
• First, determine if the lesion is intra-axial or extra-axial. Although metastases may be 
either, the differential diagnosis for tumors in each intracranial compartment is otherwise completely different. 
• 
The most common primary extra-axial tumor is meningioma. 

• 
The most common primary intra-axial tumor is glioma, especially glioblastoma in older 


patients. 
• Findings of an extra-axial mass include a CSF cleft between the mass and the brain, and gray matter interposed between the mass and white matter. 

Extra-axial mass: Axial T2-weighted MRI (left image) shows a large, partially hypercellular and partially cystic mass adjacent to the right frontal lobe. A thin CSF cleft (yellow arrow) separates the mass from the brain parenchyma and there is adjacent gray matter buckling (blue arrow), confirming the mass’s extra-axial location. Coronal post-contrast T1-weighted image (right image) shows gray matter interposed between the mass and the white matter (red arrows). The mass homogeneously enhances and invades the adjacent bony calvarium. 
This mass was a cystic meningioma. Case courtesy Gregory Wrubel, MD. 
• Findings of an intra-axial mass include absence of intervening gray matter between the mass and the white matter. 

Intra-axial mass: Axial T2-weighted (left image) and post-contrast T1-weighted MRI (right image) show a large, predominantly cystic mass with enhancing components laterally. The mass is located in the right frontal/temporal lobe and causes effacement of the right lateral ventricle and mild midline shift to the left. The mass directly abuts the white matter (yellow arrows), without intervening gray matter, confirming intra-axial location. 
This was a pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. Case courtesy Raymond Huang, MD and David Lee, MD. 
• Other signs are not as specific. White matter (vasogenic) edema is more common in intra-axial masses but meningioma (an extra-axial dural neoplasm) can also cause this finding. A dural tail (pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement) is seen most often with extra-axial masses, but peripherally located intra-axial lesions may also produce this appearance. 
• After determining the intracranial compartment of the lesion, the differential can often be narrowed further by specific location. 
The most common cerebellopontine angle masses are vestibular schwannoma, meningioma, and epidermoid cyst. The most common pineal region tumors are germ cell tumors, such as germinoma, followed by pineal 
parenchymal tumors, such as pineoblastoma. 
The most common tumors involving the corpus callosum and crossing midline (butterfly tumors) are primary central nervous system lymphoma and glioblastoma. The most common cortical (rather than subcortical) supratentorial brain tumors are pleomorphic 
xanthoastrocytoma, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor, oligodendroglioma, and ganglioglioma. 
The most common primary central skull base tumors are chordoma and chondrosarcoma. 
What is the age of the patient? 
• In combination with location, the differential may depend on whether the patient is a child 
or adult. The most common suprasellar tumors are pituitary adenoma in adults and craniopharyngioma in children. The most common posterior fossa tumors in adults are hemangioblastoma and metastases, whereas 
in children the most common are pilocytic astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and diffuse 
midline/intrinsic pontine glioma. The most common purely intraventricular masses in the atrium of the lateral ventricle are meningioma and degenerative choroid plexus cyst/xanthogranuloma in adults and choroid plexus papilloma in children. 
The most common mass of the foramen of Monro in adults is colloid cyst, whereas the most common in children is subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. 
What are the signal/attenuation and enhancement characteristics of the lesion? 
• 
As previously described, most brain lesions are hyperintense on T2-weighted images and hypointense on T1-weighted images. MRI signal characteristics are most helpful if a lesion is either hypointense with T2/T2*-weighting (due to hypercellularity, hemorrhage, calcification, or proteinaceous fluid) or hyperintense with T1-weighting (due to fat, hemorrhage, melanin, or proteinaceous fluid). 

• 
On noncontrast CT, most tumors fall within a range of brain/soft tissue attenuation and may be difficult to detect in the absence of surrounding edema. More marked hyperattenuation on CT may be due to hemorrhage or calcification, while more marked hypoattenuation may be due to cystic or necrotic components or fat. 

• 
Contrast enhancement occurs in the vast majority of extra-axial and non-glial intra-axial neoplasms. Among gliomas, non-enhancing tumor is more likely to reflect lower histologic grade, but this correspondence is not entirely reliable: high-grade gliomas may not enhance in a third of cases and certain low-grade neoplasms like pilocytic astrocytoma and 


gangliogliomas show enhancement. 
• 
Fat is characteristic of a few lesions: lipoma, dermoid cyst, and teratoma. Rarely, meningioma may show fatty metaplasia (lipomatous meningioma). 

• 
Calcifications are found in a minority of certain common tumors but some less common 


lesions nearly always have calcifications. 
The most common extra-axial tumor that may calcify is meningioma. The vast majority of craniopharyngiomas are calcified. The most common intra-axial tumor that may calcify is astrocytoma. The vast majority of 
oligodendrogliomas are calcified. Intracranial calcifications are most commonly physiologic/aging-related rather than tumoral, such as in the choroid plexus, pineal gland, and dura of the tentorium and falx cerebri. However, these can be helpful in localizing tumors based on their displacement: a tumor that engulfs pineal calcifications is more likely a germ cell tumor, while one that disperses pineal calcifications to the periphery is more likely to be a pineal 
parenchymal tumor. 
• Hemorrhage, as noted before, is associated with a variety of primary and secondary brain tumors. Tumoral hemorrhage can be distinguished from primary intracerebral hemorrhage by detecting a contrast-enhancing mass within or around the hemorrhage. 
SWI is the most sensitive sequence for detecting intratumoral microhemorrhages. 
T1 shortening can be due to not only methemoglobin but also melanin. The presence of intrinsic 
hyperintensity on T1-weighted images, even without corresponding susceptibility effect, raises the possibility of metastatic melanoma. Most hemorrhagic brain tumors are malignant. A common exception is pituitary macroadenoma. 
• Hypercellularity appears as hypointensity on T2-weighted images and greater restricted diffusion. Examples include lymphoma, medulloblastoma, germinoma, and some glioblastomas. Metastatic adenocarcinomas also frequently appear hypointense on T2­weighted images but the histologic correlate is unclear. 
• Cysts are a feature of many low-grade tumors, typically at the periphery of the enhancing 
component. In contrast, although necrosis of a high-grade tumor may also follow CSF signal, 
necrosis tends to be central and surrounded by enhancing tumor. 
In the supratentorial brain, the most common cystic tumors with a mural nodule are ganglioglioma and 
pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. 
In the infratentorial brain, the most common cystic tumors with a mural nodule are pilocytic astrocytoma 
and hemangioblastoma. 
In the sellar region, the most common cystic lesions are pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma, and Rathke cleft cyst. 
Common extra-axial tumors that occasionally show cystic change include meningioma and schwannoma. The differential for cysts without nodular/thick enhancement includes nonneoplastic entities, such as arachnoid, dermoid, epidermoid, neuroenteric, pineal, colloid, neuroglial, choroidal fissure, hippocampal sulcus remnant, porencephalic, and parasitic cysts. 


Glial cells 
Overview of glial cells 
• A glioma is a primary CNS tumor that arises from a glial cell. Glial cells include astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells, and choroid plexus cells. 
Astrocyte 
• The normal functions of an astrocyte are to provide biochemical support to the endothelial cells which maintain the blood-brain barrier, to maintain extracellular ion balance, and to aid 
in repair after a neuronal injury. 
• Astrocytes are normally located throughout the entire brain (primarily in the white matter) and spinal cord. 
Oligodendrocyte 
• The normal function of an oligodendrocyte is to maintain myelin around CNS axons. A single oligodendrocyte can maintain the myelin of dozens of axons. 
The counterpart in the peripheral nervous system is the Schwann cell, which maintains myelin around a single peripheral nerve. Unlike the oligodendrocyte, each Schwann cell is in charge of only a single axon. 
• Oligodendrocytes are normally located throughout the entire brain and spinal cord. 
Ependymal cells 
• 
The normal function of an ependymal cell is to circulate CSF with its multiple cilia. 

• 
Ependymal cells line the ventricles and central canal of the spinal cord. Choroid plexus cells are modified ependymal cells that function in producing CSF; they are located in specific locations as described earlier in the chapter. 




Diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors 
Overview 
• Glioma, or glial neoplasm, is not a synonym for a “brain tumor” or a specific pathological diagnosis but is often used loosely to indicate subtypes of primary brian tumors derived 
from glial cells.  
• 
Diffuse gliomas, including subtypes from astrocytic and oligodendroglial cell origins, are the most common type of primary brain tumor in adults. 

• 
Characterized by their infiltrative growth, diffuse gliomas are rarely curable and therefore are considered grade 2 to 4 by the World Health Organization (WHO). In contrast, WHO grade 1, localized gliomas are generally curable by total resection. 

• 
“Low-grade glioma” usually refers to WHO grade 2 diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors, whereas “lower-grade glioma” refers to grades 2 and 3, and “high-grade glioma” refers to grade 3 and 4 tumors in this category. 

• 
Since 2016, molecular data including IDH1/2 mutation and 1p/19q chromosomal co-deletion status are considered with, and usually supersede, histological phenotype to form integrated 


pathological diagnoses of diffuse glioma subtypes. 
IDH-wildtype diffuse gliomas 

Glioblastoma with MR perfusion: Axial post-contrast T1-weighted (left image) and T2-weighted (middle image) MRI show a heterogeneous enhancing mass with central necrosis and surrounding edema/T2 prolongation in the left parietal lobe. There is associated mildly elevated CBV in the non-necrotic peripheral components 
(arrows, right image). 
• IDH-wildtype diffuse gliomas are most commonly diagnosed as glioblastoma, WHO grade 4. 
In turn, most glioblastomas are IDH-wildtype, which confers a worse prognosis. These tumors are usually primary glioblastomas, indicating they arise de novo rather than from an existing 
lower-grade glioma. 
Grade 2 or 3 IDH-wildtype diffuse gliomas are rare and treated as early glioblastoma as they rapidly transform to grade 4 tumors. 
• 
IDH-wildtype glioblastomas occur mostly in the elderly. 

• 
Glioblastoma is often abbreviated GBM, due to the historical term “glioblastoma multiforme” describing the heterogeneous appearance of the tumor. 



IDH-wildtype diffuse gliomas (continued) 
• 
On MRI, IDH-wildtype glioblastomas typically have heterogeneous enhancement, corresponding histologically to microvascular proliferation and necrosis. Surrounding nonenhancing T2 prolongation consists of both vasogenic edema and infiltrative tumor. The enhancing component and sometimes the non-enhancing infiltrative component can exhibit low diffusivity (dark ADC) on diffusion-weighted imaging due to hypercellularity, and elevated blood volume (rCBV) on perfusion-weighted imaging, indicating hypervascularity.   

• 
Tumor can spread through white matter tracts, through the CSF, and along leptomeningeal, ependymal, and subependymal routes. There are several specific terms reflecting aggressive growth patterns: 


When glioblastoma crosses the midline via the corpus callosum, it is called butterfly glioblastoma. The differential diagnosis of a transcallosal mass includes glioblastoma, lymphoma, and demyelinating 
disease. 
When diffuse glioma, usually IDH-wildtype, involves at least three lobes of the brain, it is called gliomatosis cerebri. The differential diagnosis for diffuse signal abnormality includes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and HIV encephalopathy, but these entities do not infiltrate the cortex. 
When there are multiple enhancing glioblastoma lesions, the tumors are multifocal if they are connected by FLAIR abnormality or, more rarely, multicentric if no connection is present. 
When intracranial tumors disseminate to the intradural extramedullary compartment of the spine, they are called drop metastases. 

Transependymal and transcallosal spread of Gliomatosis: Axial FLAIR shows infiltrative FLAIR hyperintensity GBM: Post-contrast T1-weighted MRI shows in the left cerebral hemisphere involving the left parietal lobe, extensive abnormal enhancement primarily in posterior frontal lobe, insula, left temporal lobe, and corpus 
the left occipital lobe but extending into the  callosum. There is regional mass effect with effacement of the  
bilateral periventricular frontal lobes via the  left lateral ventricle, sulcal effacement, and rightward midline  
subependymal surface (yellow arrows) and  shift. No associated contrast enhancement or restricted  
crossing the midline via the corpus callosum  diffusion is seen.

IDH-mutant diffuse gliomas 
• IDH-mutant diffuse gliomas carry gain-of-function mutations in IDH1 or IDH2, which encode isoforms of isocitrate dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the Krebs cycle. 
The mutations lead to overproduction of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), a metabolite that can be measured by MR spectroscopy. 
• IDH-mutant diffuse gliomas are most commonly diagnosed as WHO grade 2 or 3 tumors. These are divided into astrocytic and oligodendroglial subtypes based on 1p19q chromosomal co-deletion (allelic loss of the short arm of chromosome 1 and the long arm of 
chromosome 19). 
1p19q non-co-deleted IDH-mutant tumors are more common and include diffuse astrocytomas (WHO grade 2) and anaplastic astrocytomas (grade 3). 1p19q co-deleted IDH-mutant tumors are less common and include oligodendrogliomas (WHO grade 2) 
and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (grade 3). 
Histologically, lower-grade diffuse gliomas can have both astrocytic and oligodendroglial phenotypes and were previously termed oligoastrocytomas or mixed gliomas. These terms are no longer used when 1p19q co-deletion status is available. 
• These tumors grow very slowly, often only noticeably changing when imaging over a long time. Over time, as mutations accumulate, these tumors can behave more aggressively and secondarily become grade 4, which may be histologically indistinguishable from IDH­wildtype glioblastomas but nevertheless carry a better prognosis. 
• IDH-mutant diffuse gliomas occur mostly in young to middle-aged adults (20–55 years). 1p19q non-co-deleted astrocytomas usually present younger, typically between 20 and 30 years. 
1p19q co-deleted oligodendrogliomas usually present between 30 and 40 years with seizures. 
• On MRI, IDH-mutant diffuse gliomas are predominantly hypoenhancing and more homogeneous than their IDH-wildtype counterparts. Contrast enhancement is present in a 
minority and more likely in grade 3 than grade 2 tumors. 
• Lower-grade astrocytomas typically appear as a circumscribed hyperintense mass on 
T2-weighted images. In 12–25% of nonenhancing lower-grade gliomas in adults, the T2­FLAIR mismatch sign is highly specific for 1p19q non-co-deleted IDH-mutant astrocytomas: hyperintense on T2-weighted images but relatively centrally hypointense on FLAIR due to microcystic changes. 

T2-FLAIR mismatch: Axial FLAIR (left image) and T2-weighted (right image) MRI demonstrate a hyperintense intra-axial mass in the left posterior medial temporal lobe with lower FLAIR signal than T2 signal (yellow arrows), representing the T2-FLAIR mismatch sign, which is highly suggestive of 1p19q non-co-deleted astrocytoma. The mass has no post-contrast enhancement, restricted diffusion, or calcification (not shown). Note the trapped left temporal horn (red arrow). 
IDH-mutant diffuse gliomas (continued) 

Anaplastic astrocytoma: Axial FLAIR image shows Anaplastic astrocytoma in a different patient: Axial a region of T2 prolongation in the left occipital post-contrast T1-weighted MRI shows an enhancing white matter and cortex (arrows). There was no lesion in the right temporal lobe (arrow). This enhancement (not shown). This appearance is appearance is not specific and may represent a not specific and may also represent a low-grade glioblastoma or metastatic disease. 
astrocytoma.

• Lower-grade oligodendrogliomas typically appear as a poorly circumscribed hyperintense mass on T2-weighted images. They are most often found in the frontal and temporal cortical regions and the majority calcify. An expansile, cortical-based mass with gyriform calcification is specific for 1p19q-co-deleted IDH-mutant oligodendroglioma. On diffusion-weighted imaging, oligodendrogliomas often show high diffusivity (higher ADC than brain), and frequently show mildly elevated blood volume. This is one of the low-grade CNS tumors that can show high blood volume (meningiomas also can show high rCBV). 

Oligodendroglioma: Axial FLAIR (left image) demonstrates a hyperintense, expansile, cortically based mass centered in the right precentral gyrus. Axial noncontrast CT (right image) shows the mass is partially calcified. 



Supratentorial cortical glial/neuronal tumors 
Overview 
• In addition to oligodendrogliomas, there are several rare, low-grade primary neoplasms of glial, neuronal, or mixed glial-neuronal lineage that are predominantly centered in the 
superficial cerebrum. 
• The supratentorial cortical tumors can be remembered with the acronym P-DOG MD: 
Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA). 
Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET). Oligodendroglioma. Ganglioglioma. 
Multinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumor (MVNT). Desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma and ganglioglioma (DIA/DIG). 
• 
These tumors carry a better prognosis and occur at a younger age than diffuse gliomas. 

• 
Due to cortical involvement, these patients most often present with seizures. 

• 
Slow-growing cortical tumors can cause scalloping/remodeling of the inner table of the calvarium. Extensive vasogenic edema is uncommon, consistent with their low-grade behavior. 


Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) 

Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma: 
Axial T2-weighted (left image) and 
post-contrast T1-weighted (right 
image) MRI shows a large right temporal, predominantly cystic 
mass. The mass has enhancing nodularity laterally (red arrow). 
The overlying dura is thickened and 
enhancing (yellow arrow). There is 
relatively little surrounding edema given the large size of the lesion. 
Case courtesy Raymond Huang, MD and David Lee, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) is a WHO grade 2 astrocytic tumor. A more aggressive variant is the anaplastic PXA (grade 3). 

• 
PXAs usually present in children or young adults. 

• 
The majority of PXAs carry the BRAF V600E targetable mutation. 

• 
PXA is most commonly located in the temporal lobe (half of cases), involving the cortex and leptomeninges. 

• 
On MRI, PXA is an avidly enhancing mass often associated with cyst formation and a thickened/enhancing pial tail. 

• 
Aside from PXA, the main differential for a cortical solid and cystic lesion in this age group is ganglioglioma. Although uncommon, hemorrhage is more likely with PXA. 



Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET) 
• 
Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET) is a WHO grade 1 glioneuronal tumor. 

• 
DNETs usually present in children or young adults. 

• 
DNET is most commonly located in the temporal lobe (1/2 to 2/3 of cases), involving the cortex. They are found less commonly in the frontal lobe, basal ganglia, or brainstem. 



Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET; continued) 
• 
On CT, DNET appears hypodense and occasionally calcifies. On MRI, DNETs show a circumscribed bubbly appearance with T2 prolongation and a bright rim or hyperintense ring sign on FLAIR. The tumor can be heterogeneous and show enhancement. 

• 
DNETs frequently coexist with focal cortical dysplasia, and cortical expansion is a feature more commonly found in tumors than in pure cortical malformations. 



Ganglioglioma 

Ganglioglioma: Axial FLAIR shows a cystic 
lesion in the right temporal lobe with an associated large solid nodule (arrows). There is mild surrounding edema and mild mass 
effect with midline shift to the left. 
Case courtesy Amir Zamani, MD, Brigham 
and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Ganglioglioma is a WHO grade 1 glioneuronal tumor. A more aggressive variant is the anaplastic ganglioglioma (grade 3). 

• 
Gangliogliomas usually present in children or young adults. 

• 
Ganglioglioma is most commonly located in the temporal lobe (3/4 of cases), involving the cortex. 


They can also be found in cerebellum and near the conus medullaris, mimicking myxopapillary ependymoma. 
• The imaging appearance is variable. A common appearance is a circumscribed cystic mass with enhancing mural nodule, often with calcification, but ganglioglioma can also be solidly 
enhancing or nonenhancing. 
• Gangliogliomas frequently coexist with focal cortical dysplasia. 
Multinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumor (MVNT) 
• 
MVNT is a recently recognized WHO grade 1 entity. It usually presents in young and middle-aged adults with seizure or may be an incidental finding. 

• 
MVNT is most commonly located in the temporal or frontal lobes, centered at the deep layers of cortex and juxtacortical white matter. 

• 
On MRI, MVNT characteristically appears as a cluster of bubbles: small, circumscribed hyperintense nodules on T2-weighted imaging, usually without enhancement or mass effect. 


Desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma and ganglioglioma (DIA/DIG) 
• 
DIA and DIG are classified together as WHO grade 1 glial/glioneuronal tumors. They present in infants usually with progressive head enlargement. 

• 
DIA/DIG is most commonly located in the frontal and parietal lobes, involving the cortex and attaching to the leptomeninges. However, they are quite large at presentation, often 


spanning more than one lobe of the cerebral hemisphere. 
• On MRI, DIA/DIG characteristically appears as a large multicystic and solid mass (cysts with mural nodule). The solid component enhances avidly. 


Posterior fossa intra-axial tumors 
Overview 
• The differential diagnosis for posterior fossa intra-axial tumors depends on age (see flowchart at the end of this section). They are more common in children. Extra-axial lesions are discussed in the “Head and Neck” chapter in the section on temporal bone and lateral/ 
posterior skull base. 
• The main posterior fossa intra-axial tumors in children (and young adults) can be remembered by the acronym BEAM: 
Brainstem glioma (diffuse). 
Ependymoma. 
Astrocytoma (pilocytic). Medulloblastoma. 
• The most common adult posterior fossa intra-axial tumors are metastasis and 
hemangioblastoma. Less common entities occurring in older adults include diffuse glioma 
and subependymoma. 
• Although less common, most of these tumors can also occur in the supratentorial brain, 
except for medulloblastoma. CNS embryonal tumors other than medulloblastoma, however, are often supratentorial. 
Hemangioblastoma 

Hemangioblastoma: Axial T2-weighted MRI (left image) shows a cystic lesion (arrow) in the right cerebellar hemisphere with mild surrounding edema. The nodular component is demonstrated on FLAIR (arrow, right). 
Case courtesy Sanjay Prabhu, MD, Boston Children’s Hospital. 
• Hemangioblastoma is a highly vascular WHO grade 1 tumor that is the most common primary brain neoplasm in the posterior fossa in adults, usually presenting in young to middle-aged adults. 
• Hemangioblastoma occurs most commonly in the cerebellum, followed by spinal 
cord (discussed in the “Spine” chapter), brainstem, and retina. It only rarely occurs 
supratentorially. 
• About 25% of patients with hemangioblastoma have von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. In turn, most patients with VHL have hemangioblastomas, sometimes multiple. 
• The classic appearance of hemangioblastoma is a cystic mass with an avidly enhancing mural nodule. Prominent vessels are often seen as tubular areas of flow-void. Less commonly, a hemangioblastoma may be solid or hemorrhagic. 
Diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M-mutant 

Diffuse brainstem glioma: Axial and sagittal FLAIR images demonstrate an expansile, T2 hyperintense mass centered in the pons with involvement of the entire brainstem, cerebellar peduncles, and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres. The mass does not restrict or enhance (not shown). There is resultant obstructive hydrocephalus due to compression of the fourth ventricle (arrows). 
• 
Most diffuse gliomas affecting children and young adults in the brainstem, especially pons, and thalamus are IDH-wildtype grade 4 tumors characterized molecularly by an histone H3 lysine-to-methionine substitution at residue 27. 

• 
In the absence of biopsy allowing for molecular classification, the most common pediatric brainstem tumor was historically known as diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma or diffuse brainstem glioma. 

• 
Diffuse midline gliomas typically appear as an expansile, solid or infiltrative mass in the brainstem or diencephalon that is hyperintense on FLAIR. Contrast enhancement is variable. 

• 
This location-specific, molecular classification is associated with poor prognosis. Imaging does not reliably distinguish H3 K27M-mutant and wildtype tumors, but the former is most common in the appropriate age group and location. 


Pilocytic astrocytoma / juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma (JPA) 



Pilocytic astrocytoma / juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma (continued) 
• 
Pilocytic astrocytoma, often called juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma (JPA), is a WHO grade 1 astrocytic tumor. Unlike diffuse gliomas, JPAs are well-circumscribed. 

• 
JPA typically occurs in children, as the name suggests, and is the most common benign brain tumor of childhood. 

• 
The majority occur in the cerebellum. The second most common location of pilocytic astrocytoma is the optic pathway/hypothalamus, which is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) in 1/3 of cases. Posterior fossa JPA is not associated with NF1. 

• 
Greater than 70% of cerebellar JPA carry BRAF gene fusions, an important diagnostic marker and potential therapeutic target. 

• 
MRI typically shows a cystic mass with an avidly enhancing nodule and relatively little edema. A minority have little to no cystic component. 

• 
A more aggressive variant is the pilomyxoid astrocytoma, which is not distinguishable on imaging but tends to involve optic chiasm/hypothalamus in younger children and infants. 


Ependymoma 

Ependymoma: Precontrast T1-weighted (left image) and post-contrast T1-weighted sagittal MRI (right image) shows a lobulated, isointense, avidly enhancing mass arising from the fourth ventricle (arrows). There is kinking of the brainstem and obstructive hydrocephalus of the third ventricle. 
Case courtesy Amir Zamani, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• Ependymoma is a WHO grade 2 tumor arising from the ependymal lining of the ventricular system and central canal of the spinal cord. A more aggressive variant is anaplastic 
ependymoma (grade 3). 
Benign ependymal tumors include subependymoma (discussed later in this section) and myxopapillary ependymoma (discussed in the “Spine” chapter). 
• Ependymoma tends to occur in the posterior fossa in children. In adults, ependymomas occur more commonly in the spinal cord (discussed in the “Spine” chapter) and 
supratentorium. 
• On imaging, ependymomas appear as an enhancing mass with heterogeneity related to 
cystic/necrotic change, calcification, or hemorrhage. 
• The posterior fossa ependymoma has been called the toothpaste or plastic tumor for its 
propensity to fill the fourth ventricle and squeeze through the foramina of Magendie or Luschka into the adjacent basal cisterns. In contrast, medulloblastoma, which can also fill the fourth ventricle, does not typically squeeze through 
the foramina. 
Subependymoma 

Sagittal T1-weighted MRI shows an isointense mass in the inferior fourth ventricle (arrows). The fourth ventricle is normal in size. 
• Subependymoma is an indolent, WHO grade 1 tumor of unclear origin that is speculated 
to arise from subependymal astrocytes, ependymal cells lining the ventricles, or common 
precursor cells. 
• 
Subependymoma is a tumor of middle-aged and older adults. It is often found incidentally. 

• 
The most common locations are the walls of the fourth and lateral ventricles. The tumor grows exophytically into the ventricle and does not cause parenchymal edema. It usually does not enhance significantly, unlike ependymomas. 




Medulloblastoma 




Medulloblastoma. Case courtesy Gregory Wrubel, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 
• 
Medulloblastoma is the prototype and most common of the WHO grade 4 embryonal tumors of the CNS, which appear histologically as small round blue cell tumors. 

• 
Medulloblastoma is the most common brain malignancy of childhood, usually diagnosed between the ages of 3 and 10 years. A small proportion are associated with a cancer predisposition syndrome, including Gorlin (-Goltz/basal cell nevus) syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and Turcot syndrome in the setting of familial adenomatous polyposis. 

• 
The current WHO classification includes both histological (classic, large cell/anaplastic, desmoplastic/nodular, and extensive nodularity) and molecular subgroups (WNT-activated, SHH-activated, group 3, and group 4) to define prognosis and guide treatment. 


In children, group 3 and 4 tumors are most common and are located in the midline (cerebellar vermis) or 
fourth ventricle. In infants, SHH-activated tumors are most common and may be located in the cerebellar hemisphere or midline/fourth ventricle. 
WNT-activated tumors occur in older children and likely arise from the cerebellopontine angle. 

Medulloblastoma (continued) 
• Medulloblastoma is slightly hyperattenuating on CT due to its densely packed cells and is accordingly hypointense on T2-weighted images and has low ADC values. The tumor enhances, except for possibly group 4 tumors, and may appear heterogeneous due to internal hemorrhage and calcification. 
The low ADC values can be a useful finding to differentiate medulloblastoma from ependymoma and pilocytic astrocytoma, the two other most common childhood posterior fossa tumors. 
• Leptomeningeal metastatic disease is present in up to 1/3 of patients and medulloblastoma is the most common cause of drop metastases to the spine in children. In this setting, sugar-coating (Zuckerguss) refers to the icing-like enhancement over the brain and spinal cord surface. Imaging of the entire brain and spine should be performed prior to surgery.  Since medulloblastomas are hypercellular, DWI is particularly helpful in detecting 
leptomeningeal disease. 
• When medulloblastoma occurs in a young adult (as opposed to a child), the tumor tends to arise eccentrically in the posterior fossa, from the cerebellar hemisphere. 
Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) 
• 
Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is an uncommon WHO grade 4 embryonal tumor characterized molecularly by loss of SMARCB1/INI1 or SMARCA4/BRG1 expression. 

• 
AT/RT appears similar to medulloblastoma but is less common and occurs in slightly younger patients. It should be considered as part of the differential for a large brain tumor in children 


younger than three years of age. 
• The majority occur in the cerebellum. Unlike medulloblastoma, however, about a third of cases of AT/RT are supratentorial. For a large heterogeneous supratentorial mass in an infant/young child, the differential diagnosis includes 
AT/RT and, less commonly, what was previously known as primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) and is now mostly classified as either (1) embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes (ETMR), C19MC-altered; or 
(2) CNS embryonal tumor, not otherwise specified. 
• A third of patients with AT/RT have germline mutations in SMARCB1 or SMARCA4, resulting in rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome, which is also associated with malignant 
rhabdoid tumor of the kidney. 
Dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytoma (Lhermitte-Duclos) 
• 
Dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum, more often known as Lhermitte-Duclos disease, is a WHO grade 1 neuronal lesion that has been considered a hamartoma by some and neoplasm by others. 

• 
Adult-onset Lhermitte-Duclos disease is often associated with Cowden syndrome (multiple hamartoma syndrome associated with benign mucocutaneous lesions like facial 


trichilemmomas as well as breast and thyroid cancer), a part of the PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome. 
• The characteristic imaging finding is a corduroy or tiger-striped appearance of thickened folia in the cerebellar hemisphere. The lesion is hyperintense on T2-weighted images and enhancement is rare.

Intraventricular tumors 
Overview 
• 
Most of the aforementioned intra-axial posterior fossa tumors (especially ependymoma, subependymoma, medulloblastoma) can protrude into the ventricle and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of an intraventricular mass. 

• 
Aside from periventricular tumors, other sites of origin of intraventricular tumors include the septum pellucidum and choroid plexus. 

• 
Aside from neoplasms, the differential of intraventricular masses includes developmental/ degenerative cysts, which do not enhance. 

• 
Intraventricular tumors can cause obstructive hydrocephalus. 


Central neurocytoma 

Central neurocytoma: Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (left image) and T2-weighted (right) MRI demonstrates a lobulated mass in the body of the left lateral ventricle (arrow) attached to the septum pellucidum. The mass enhances and contains foci of cystic change (seen as hyperintense foci on the T2-weighted image). 
Case courtesy Amir Zamani, MD, Brigham and Women’s Hospital. 

Central neurocytoma (continued) 
• 
Central neurocytoma is a WHO grade 2 neuronal tumor that occurs in young adults. 

• 
The most common location is the anterior part of the lateral ventricle near the foramen of Monro, sometimes extending into the third ventricle. Extraventricular neurocytomas are 


rare. 
• Typical imaging findings are a heterogeneous, multicystic (bubbly or Swiss cheese appearing), lobulated, moderately enhancing mass attached to the septum pellucidum. Calcification is common. 
Intraventricular meningioma 

Intraventricular meningioma: Coronal T1-weighted (left image) and axial T2-weighted (right image) MRI shows a T1 hypointense, T2 slightly hyperintense mass (arrows) in the atrium of the left ventricle. 
Case courtesy Mary Beth Cunnane, MD, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. 
• 
Intraventricular meningioma appears as a solid mass, typically in the trigone of the lateral ventricle. It tends to occur in older patients, similar to other meningiomas. 

• 
Intraventricular meningiomas are typically hypercellular and homogeneously enhance, distinguishing them from other intraventricular neoplasms. 


Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) 
• 
Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) is a benign (WHO grade 1) astrocytoma variant that is associated with tuberous sclerosis complex. Other common intracranial findings in tuberous sclerosis include subependymal nodules (hamartomas), cortical/subcortical tubers, and white matter radial bands. 

• 
SEGA classically is an enhancing, heterogeneous mass in the lateral ventricle near the foramen of Monro. 

• 
SEGA is distinguished from subependymal nodules at the caudothalamic groove by serial growth or size >1 cm. 


Choroid plexus xanthogranuloma 
• Choroid plexus xanthogranuloma is the most common choroid plexus mass in adults. Also 
known as degenerative choroid plexus cyst, they represent collections of cholesterol and lipid-laden histiocytes. 
• 
They are usually located in the atria of the lateral ventricles. 

• 
On MRI, they are hyperintense on T2-weighted images, do not attenuate completely on FLAIR, and restrict diffusion. 



Choroid plexus tumors 

Choroid plexus papilloma: Axial T2-weighted image shows a 
hyperintense, cauliflower-like mass (arrows) in the left cerebellomedullary fissure deforming 
the medulla. The center of the mass is at the foramen of Luschka, which is 
likely its location of origin. 
Case courtesy Sanjay Prabhu, MD, Boston Children’s Hospital. 
• Choroid plexus tumors consist of, in decreasing frequency, choroid plexus papilloma (WHO grade 1), atypical choroid plexus papilloma (grade 2), and choroid plexus carcinoma (grade 
3). These are not reliably distinguishable on imaging. 
• 
Choroid plexus papilloma most commonly occurs in infants and young children, but it may also occur in adults. 

• 
Choroid plexus tumors arise from choroid plexus epithelium and are therefore entirely 


intraventricular in location. In children, the atrium of the lateral ventricle is the most common location. In adults, the fourth ventricle is the most common location. Less commonly, choroid plexus papilloma may arise from the third ventricle or cerebellomedullary angle, 
as in the case shown. 
• The characteristic appearance on MRI is a cauliflower-like intraventricular mass that avidly enhances. Higher grade is associated with larger size and more extensive surrounding white matter edema. 

Chordoid glioma 
• 
Chordoid glioma is a rare WHO grade 2 glial tumor that arises from ependymal cells of the lamina terminalis. 

• 
The tumor is distinctively located in the anterior third ventricle, associated with the hypothalamus. 

• 
Chordoid glioma is a circumscribed, ovoid, homogeneously enhancing mass that is hyperattenuating on CT and slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI. 


Colloid cyst 
• 
Colloid cysts are benign developmental lesions that are usually incidental findings and account for the most common mass of the foramina of Monro. 

• 
Colloid cyst is a circumscribed, nonenhancing lesion characteristically arising from the anterior roof of the third ventricle. 

• 
The machine oil-like contents appear hyperattenuating on CT and low signal intensity on T2­weighted images. 


Intraventricular simple cysts 
• Intraventricular simple cysts include several histologies that may be difficult to distinguish on imaging, including ependymal cyst, arachnoid cyst (more common in the subarachnoid space external to the brain), neuroepithelial/neuroglial cyst (more commonly 
intraparenchymal), and choroid plexus cyst (occurring antenatally and regressing at birth). 
• Simple cysts follow CSF signal on all sequences, including FLAIR, and do not demonstrate restricted diffusion. 


CNS lymphoma 
Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL): Overview 
• 
Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) is lymphoma isolated to the CNS, most commonly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Immature blast cells form lymphoid aggregates around small cerebral blood vessels in a periventricular location. Note that the brain does not contain native lymphoid tissue. 

• 
PCNSL is known to “melt away” with chemoradiation but a subset tends to recur aggressively. 

• 
The appearance of PCNSL depends on the immune status of the patient. Regardless of immune status, however, key imaging findings are a periventricular location, high cellularity (hyperattenuating on CT, relatively hypointense on T2-weighted images, and reduced diffusivity), and contrast enhancement. The lesions may be solitary or multiple. Vasogenic 


edema is common. 
• Intralesional hemorrhage in untreated PCNSL is extremely rare and can be a very helpful sign to differentiate PCNSL from glioblastomas, which commonly show microhemorrhages. 
Primary CNS lymphoma: Immunocompetent patient

Primary CNS lymphoma: Immunocompetent patient (continued) 
• 
In an immunocompetent patient, PCNSL typically presents as an homogeneously enhancing mass. 

• 
Involvement of the frontal lobes and basal ganglia is most common, but it can be centered also in the brainstem and cerebellum. Transcallosal infiltration can occur, which is called a 


butterfly lesion. 
The differential diagnosis for a mass involving the corpus callosum includes lymphoma, glioblastoma, and demyelinating lesion. 

Primary CNS lymphoma: Immunocompromised patient 
• 
Immunodeficiency-related CNS lymphoma is associated with EBV infection. 

• 
In an immunocompromised patient, PCNSL typically presents as an irregular, ring-enhancing lesion. The ring enhancement is caused by central necrosis. 

• 
The most common causes of ring-enhancing brain masses in patients with HIV/AIDS are lymphoma and toxoplasmosis. These lesions are usually multiple, although a single large lesion is more likely to represent lymphoma. Several clinical and imaging options are available to differentiate between lymphoma and toxoplasmosis: 


Empirical anti-toxoplasmosis therapy and short-interval follow-up imaging. MR DWI: Lymphoma tends to restrict diffusion more than toxoplasmosis does. MR perfusion: Lymphoma has higher rCBV than toxoplasmosis. MR spectroscopy: Lymphoma shows elevated choline compared to toxoplasmosis. 
FDG PET: Lymphoma has higher glucose metabolism than toxoplasmosis does. Thallium SPECT: Lymphoma more avidly takes up thallium than toxoplasmosis does. 

Secondary CNS lymphoma 
• 
Secondary CNS lymphoma represents involvement of the CNS in a patient with known systemic lymphoma. 

• 
Secondary CNS lymphoma is more commonly extra-axial, involving leptomeninges, dura, and/or skull. Less commonly, it may present as a parenchymal mass. 




Metastatic disease 
Overview 
• 
The most common primary tumors to cause intracranial metastases are lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma. 

• 
Brain parenchymal metastases are more common than meningeal metastases. 

• 
Brain metastases are more common than primary brain malignancies in adults. 



Intra-axial metastasis 
• 
Most parenchymal metastases are hematogenous and arise at the gray-white matter junction, where there is a caliber change in the small arterioles. 

• 
Enhancement is universal, as capillaries produced by an extra-CNS primary tumor do not have a functioning blood-brain barrier. 

• 
Larger metastases often feature marked edema, while small metastases may present as tiny 


enhancing foci that are apparent only on the post-contrast images. Factors that increase lesion conspicuity on contrast-enhanced imaging include higher contrast dose, 
gadolinium-based contrast agent with greater relaxivity, delayed imaging after contrast injection, and higher magnetic field strength. 

Intra-axial metastasis (continued) 
• The most common hemorrhagic metastases to the brain are melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, and thyroid cancer (especially papillary carcinoma). Breast 
and lung cancer are also included in this differential due to their high prevalence, although 
hemorrhagic metastases are an atypical presentation. The main causes of a solitary hemorrhagic brain neoplasm are metastatic carcinomas and glioblastoma. Tumorous intracerebral hemorrhage may be difficult to distinguish initially from primary intracerebral 
hemorrhage (such as due to hypertension or amyloid angiopathy) but should be suspected by the 
presence of an enhancing component or failure to resolve on follow-up. 

Extra-axial metastasis 
• Leptomeningeal metastases, also known as carcinomatous meningitis, appears as serpentine contrast enhancement at the pial surface of the brain. FLAIR shows sulcal hyperintensity. 
The main causes of leptomeningeal enhancement and sulcal FLAIR hyperintensity are infectious/ inflammatory meningitis and metastases. Nonenhancing sulcal FLAIR hyperintensity can also be caused by 
subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
• Dural metastases appear as focal enhancing extra-axial masses. 
The main causes of multiple dural masses are multiple meningiomatosis and metastases. 

Axial FLAIR (left image) shows a right frontal mass (yellow arrows) with vasogenic edema affecting the right frontal lobe. From this image alone it is difficult to determine if the mass is intra- or extra-axial. Axial post-contrast T1-weighted (right image) MRI shows that the mass (yellow arrow) is dural based and is associated with adjacent dural enhancement (red arrows). This was a case of metastatic breast cancer. 


Primary dural neoplasms 
Meningioma 
• 
Meningioma is by far the most common extra-axial tumor, the most common benign primary intracranial tumor in adults, and the most common cause of a solitary dural mass. It arises from meningothelial arachnoid “cap” cells. The vast majority are benign (WHO grade 1), but 4% are atypical (grade 2) and 1–2% are anaplastic or malignant (grade 3). 

• 
Meningiomas typically occur in elderly adults with a female predominance and are most often asymptomatic. 


The main environmental/acquired risk factor is ionizing radiation exposure. Meningioma is the most common radiation-induced intracranial neoplasm. The main genetic predisposition is neurofibromatosis type 2. These patients often have multiple 
meningiomas. 
• Meningiomas can occur anywhere in the neuraxis, but are most commonly supratentorial, which may be at the convexities, parasagittal/falcine, or along the skull base (e.g., olfactory groove, planum sphenoidale, tuberculum sellae, or sphenoid ridge). Other special locations (intraventricular, optic nerve sheath, cerebellopontine angle, jugular foramen, parasellar, 
and spinal) are discussed elsewhere in this book. 
• 
Meningiomas have a broad dural base; the morphology is most often globose (round) but occasionally en plaque (sheet-like). 

• 
On noncontrast CT, meningiomas are usually hyperattenuating relative to brain and approximately 25% calcify. 

• 
On MRI, appearance can be variable with iso- or slightly hypointense signal on T1-weighted images and variable signal intensity on T2-weighted images. 

• 
Meningiomas avidly enhance. An enhancing dural tail is thought to be due to vasoactive substances released by the meningioma rather than tumor spread to the dura. On 


conventional angiography, meningiomas show early arterial enhancement and contrast retention in venous phase, termed the mother-in-law sign (comes early, stays late). 
• 
Despite the extra-axial location of most meningiomas, there may be extensive white matter edema, thought to be due to vasoactive factors and a pial vascular supply. There is often a discordance between the size of meningioma and degree of white matter edema, with severe edema possible even with a very small tumor. 

• 
The adjacent bone may show reactive hyperostotic changes or even intraosseous/ transosseous extension, mimicking fibrous dysplasia or an osteoblastic malignancy. Rarely, primary intraosseous meningioma arises within the calvarium with little if any dural involvement. 



Solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma 
• A rare mimic of meningioma is the spectrum of solitary fibrous tumor (WHO grade 1) and hemangiopericytoma (grade 2 or 3). Elsewhere in the body, hemangiopericytoma has 
been redesignated as solitary fibrous tumor but the separate term remains popular in 
neuropathology. 
• On MRI, solitary fibrous tumor often shows the yin-yang sign (“black-and-white mixed” appearance) of patches of low and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. The low 
signal areas reflect fibrous stroma. There is strong contrast enhancement, reflecting tumor vascularity; flow-voids and vasogenic edema are common. 


Pineal region masses 
Overview and anatomy of the pineal region 
fornix 
massa intermedia of thalamus 
basilar artery posterior commissure internal cerebral vein splenium of corpus callosum 

vein of Galen 
pineal gland 
tectum/quadrigeminal plate 
superior and inferior colliculi 
cerebral aqueduct 
• 
The pineal gland is an extra-axial organ located in the midline just superior to the level of the midbrain at the posterior aspect of the third ventricle. The internal cerebral veins and vein of Galen are located superior and posterior to the pineal gland, respectively. 

• 
The principal neuronal cell of the pineal gland is the pinealocyte, which is evolved from photoreceptor cells and releases melatonin. Like other neuroendocrine glands, the pineal 


gland does not have a blood-brain barrier. 
• A mass lesion in the pineal region may cause compression of the cerebral aqueduct of 
Sylvius (presenting as noncommunicating hydrocephalus) or the tectum/quadrigeminal plate of the midbrain (presenting as Parinaud syndrome, including vertical gaze palsy). 
• The most common types of pineal region neoplasms are germ cell tumors, pineal 
parenchymal tumors, and gliomas. The most common mass, however, is a benign cyst. 
Germ cell tumors 

Pineal region teratoma: Sagittal noncontrast CT (left image) and axial T1-weighted MRI (right image) show a fat-containing mass in the pineal region (arrows). There is associated obstructive hydrocephalus due to 
compression of the cerebral aqueduct by the mass. 
• The most common site of intracranial germ cell tumors is the pineal gland, followed by the 
suprasellar region (discussed separately in the “Head and Neck” chapter). 
Germ cell tumors (continued) 
• 
Extragonadal germ cell tumors are thought to be due to aberrant migration of totipotent germ cells during early embryogenesis and occur in midline locations such as in the head, mediastinum, and sacrococcygeal region. 

• 
Intracranial germ cell tumors have a peak incidence in the teenage years. Pineal region germ cell tumors in particular have a male predominance. 

• 
Germinoma and teratoma are germ cell tumors that are the most common and second most common pineal region tumors, respectively, and have good prognosis. Less common 


and associated with poor prognosis are embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac (endodermal sinus) tumor, choriocarcinoma, and mixed tumors. 
• Germinoma (extra-gonadal seminoma) is the most common intracranial germ cell tumor. 
Germinoma is a highly cellular, avidly enhancing tumor that is slightly hyperdense on CT, isointense on T1- and T2-weighted images, and is dark on ADC map. Germinoma characteristically “engulfs” the pineal gland and promotes its calcification, resulting in central area of calcification. 
Imaging of the entire neuraxis is recommended as leptomeningeal deposits can occur. Treatment is 
radiotherapy, with excellent prognosis. Pineal germinoma may present with a synchronous suprasellar germ cell tumor. 
• Teratoma is the second most common pineal region tumor and confers a worse prognosis than germinoma. Teratoma has a heterogeneous imaging appearance. 
Intralesional fat is suggestive of teratoma. Teratoma is prone to hemorrhage and coarse calcification. 
Pineal parenchymal tumors 

Pineal parenchymal tumor of intermediate differentiation: Axial noncontrast CT (left image) demonstrates a hyperdense pineal mass. Post-contrast T1-weighted MRI (right image) shows the mass enhances. There is no restricted diffusivity (not shown). 
• Pineal parenchymal tumors are a spectrum including pineocytoma (WHO grade 1), pineal parenchymal tumor of intermediate differentiation and papillary tumor of the pineal region (grade 2 or 3), and pineoblastoma (grade 4). 
• 
Pineoblastomas affect young children whereas the other pineal parenchymal tumors are mostly seen in adults. 

• 
Pineoblastoma is an aggressive tumor that is histologically similar to other pediatric small round blue cell tumors, medulloblastoma, and retinoblastoma. The term trilateral retinoblastoma is used when there are retinoblastomas in both eyes and a 


pineoblastoma (both the retina and pineal gland are light-sensing organs). The suprasellar region is additionally involved in quadrilateral retinoblastoma. 
• Any solid component of a pineal parenchymal tumor should demonstrate enhancement. 
Cystic change or necrosis is common, which can make it difficult to differentiate from a 
pineal cyst. 


Pineal parenchymal tumors (continued) 
• 
Higher grade tumors are associated with ill-defined margins (invading adjacent structures), more restricted diffusion owing to high cellularity, and a propensity for CSF seeding. 

• 
Germ cell tumors “engulf” by inducing calcification of the pineal gland, whereas pineal parenchymal tumors "explode" by peripherally displacing existing physiologic pineal calcifications. 



Pineal cyst 
• 
Pineal cysts are seen commonly on MRI and have a prevalence as high as 40% on autopsy series. They are more common in women. 

• 
Most pineal cysts are less than 1 cm and asymptomatic, but may cause symptoms due to mass effect. Very few pineal cysts grow and follow-up of small pineal cysts is not routinely 


recommended. 
• 
Pineal cysts are usually not entirely simple. Most of them do not fully suppress on FLAIR. Rim calcification can be seen about 25% of the time. 

• 
Contrast is necessary when evaluating a pineal cyst, as the primary differential diagnosis is a pineal parenchymal tumor. Pineal cysts may show thin, smooth peripheral enhancement but not thick, irregular, or nodular enhancement. 


Gliomas 
• Gliomas (most commonly astrocytomas) may occur in intra-axial structures around the pineal region, such as the tectum of the midbrain, thalamus, or splenium of the corpus callosum. 

Metastases 
• 
Metastasis to the pineal gland is rare. 

• 
Leptomeningeal disease is present in 2/3 of patients with pineal metastasis. 


Meningioma 
• 
The tentorial apex, adjacent to the pineal gland, is a rare location for meningioma. 

• 
A tentorial meningioma tends to depress the internal cerebral veins, unlike tumors of pineal gland origin, which tend to lift the internal cerebral veins. 


Quadrigeminal plate lipoma 

Quadrigeminal plate lipoma: Axial (left image) and sagittal (right image) T1-weighted MRI shows a lobulated, 
hyperintense mass of the quadrigeminal plate. Note the associated thinning of the posterior body (arrow) and splenium of the corpus callosum. 
• A lipoma of the quadrigeminal plate (another name for the tectum) is a rare lesion that may 
be seen in isolation or in association with agenesis or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. 
• The quadrigeminal plate is another name for the tectum.
