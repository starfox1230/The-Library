                                INFECTION

With regard to osteomyelitis, radiographs will be normal for 7-10 days. Essentially, osteomyelitis can
have any appearance, occur in any location, and occur at any age. Children have hematogenous
spread usually hitting the long bones (metaphysis). Adults are more likely to have direct spread (in
diabetic). However, you can have hematogenous spread in certain situations as well (IV Drugs).

General Rule: Septic joints more common in adults. Osteomyelitis more common in kids.

Classic Look: Hallmarks are destruction of bone and periosteal new bone formation.

Some trivia worth knowing:

 MRl diagnosis of healed osteomyelitis is based on the return of normal fatty marrow

A cu te B acterial O steom yelitis can be thought o f in three different categories:
1) hem atogenous seeding {most common in child), 2) contiguous spread, and 3) direct
inoculation o f the bone either from surgery or trauma.

Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis has a predilection for the long bones o f the body,
specifically the metaphysis, which has the best blood flow and allows for spreading o f the
infection via small channels in the bone that lead to the subperiosteal space.

 Age < 1 month = Multi-centric involvement, often w ith  Infant
  joint involvem ent. Bone scan often negative (75%) at   Child
  this age                                                Adult

 Age < 18 months = Spread to epiphysis through blood

 Age 2-16 years = Trans-physeal vessels are closed
  (primary focus is metaphysis).

In the slightly older baby (<18 months) these vessels from the metaphysis to the epiphysis
atrophy and the growth plate stops the spread (although spread can still occur). This creates
a "septic tank" effect. This same thing happens with certain cancers (leukemia); the garbage
gets stuck in the septic tank (metaphysis). Once the grow th plates fuse, this obstruction is
no longer present.

M Rlfindings o f osteomyelitis: Low signal in the bone m arrow on T1 imaging adjacent to an
ulcer or cellulitis is diagnostic.

 Bone Adjacent to Ulcer
 (more sensitive sign)

T1 - Corresponding Low Signal

          The G h o st Sign: Neuropathic Bone O steomyelitis in a Neuropathic Bone

A bone that becomes a ghost (poor definition of margins) on T1 imaging, but then re-appears
(more morphologically distinct) on T2, or after giving IV contrast, is more likely to have
osteomyelitis.

Isolated Discitis is basically never seen in adults. The classic scenario is: kid (younger than 4)
