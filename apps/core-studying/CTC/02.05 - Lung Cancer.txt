Solid and Ground Glass Components: A part solid lesion with a ground glass
component is the most suspicious morphology you can have. Non-solids (only >
ground glass) is intermediate. Totally solid is actually the least likely morphology to ^
be cancer.

PET for SPN: You can use PET for SPNs larger than 1 Sohd Nodule ( > 1cm in size):

cm. Lung Cancer is supposed to be HOT (SUV > 2.5).    HOT = Cancer, COLD = Not Cancer

Having said that, infectious and granulomatous nodules can Ground Glass Nodules:
also be hot. If you are dealing with a ground glass nodule HOT = Infection , COLD = Cancer
it's more likely to be:                             

Perifissural Lymph Node:                                            Sag: Triangular

Typical: The classic look is a nodule
(usually lentiform or triangular) with                                   Sag: Round
a fissural attachment.                                                   Morphology

On the sagittal plane these things
really tend to look either flat or
triangular. Size change doesn't mean
much, as lymph nodes tend to
expand and contract. Having said
that - larger than 10mm will get
them a LUNG RADS follow up.

Atypical: If the nodule is spherical-shaped that is NOT considered
perifissural. This shape suggests that the growth is through the
fissure, not spreading around it.

Lung Cancer Screening: Typical nodules (smooth margins, triangular
/ oval / lentiform shape) less than 10 mm = category 2.
Larger than 10mm = Go by size criteria for follow up.

                                      SPN I Cancer Trivia:

Lung Cancer is 1.5 x more likely in the Right Lung
70% of Lung Cancer is in the Upper Lobes
Exception to the rule is pulmonary fibrosis - where peripheral basilar cancer is more common.
SPN in the setting of head and neck CA is more likely to be a primary bronchogenic carcinoma
rather than a metastasis (they have similar risk factors).
Lung Cancer is very rare under 40 (unless the patient has AIDS)
Air Bronchograms are 5x more common in malignant SPN
Air Bronchograms are found in 50% of BACs
Just because a nodule gets smaller doesn't mean it is benign. Especially if the nodule increases
in density.

Screening: Recently, the u s preventive services task force has approved lung cancer screening
with low dose CT for asymptomatic adults aged 50-80 who have a 20 pack-year history and currently
smoke (or have quit within the past 15 years).

Some trivia related to the screening program:
· Shockingly, it is backed up by evidence (which is extremely rare in medical screening programs),

  and legit improves outcomes (also rare in medicine).

· NELSON study showed a 25% reduction in lung cancer specific mortality in high risk patients.

· The follow up recommendations are NOT the same as Fleischner Society Recommendations. As
  such, nodules found on a CT done for any reason other than official lung cancer screening will
  follow Fleischner and NOT LUNG RADS recommendations used with the screening program.

· Dose on the screening CTs is supposed to be low -                 Screening Risk:
  recommended below CTDIvoi 3 mGy
                                                                    The most commonly
· Screening CTs have a minimum size thickness of 2.5mm              encountered "risk" of lung
  (although most everyone says 1.5mm or thinner is preferred).      cancer screening is the false
                                                                    positive.
· "Growth" is considered 1.5mm or more in one year
                                                                    Patient's should be counseled

· You don't give multiple ratings for multiple nodules.             the biopsy results confirm a
                                                                    cancer.
· Endobronchial "lesions" (mucus) are treated as 4a - and given
  a 3 month follow up.

· A treated remote (> 5 years) lung cancer patient must still meet
  the normal screening criteria to be enrolled in the program.

· They actually want these reported to the 0 .1mm -- which is
  hilarious to me. I love making fun of Radiologists who report things to fractions of a millimeter.
  Apparently, enough of them got together at a lung cancer meeting to make this an official
  recommendation.... which is fantastic. This kind of psychopathology is so wonderful - 1 love it.

Nodules (incidental discovery): As discussed on the prior page, nodules discovered
incidentally on non-screening scans are treated different for followup. These nodules are the captives
of the dreaded Fleischner Society recommendations.

Few Pearls:
· Fleischner guidelines only apply for patients older than 35
· They do NOT apply to patients with known or suspected cancer
· They do NOT apply to patients who are immunocompromised
· Measurements are reported as the average diameter (short + long / 2) obtained in the same plane.
· Risk stratification for follovmp (low, intermediate, high) is based on multiple risk factors (smoking,

  cancer history, family history, age, uranium / random / asbestos exposure and nodules
  characteristics / size).
· Follow up is based off the arbitrary guess of a cancer risk > 1%
· Perifissural nodules - do not need a follow up, even if they are > 6 mm in size.
· Nodule characterization should be performed on thin-slice CT images <1.5 mm. This is done to
  look for a small solid component hiding behind partial volume effect in a ground glass nodule.
· Multiple nodules (> 5) makes malignancy statistically less likely.

possible way to write a pulmonary
question. You'd just pick a nodule     "I would write a more thoughtful question but I 'm allergic to
size and ask the follow up interval.   (something having to do with the request)."

Ground Glass nodule follow up recommendations are variable. Most people will not follow up
nodules smaller than 6 mm. If they are greater than 6mm people will either do 6 month or 1 year
(depends on who you ask). Follow up is persistent for 5 years, because of the slow growth of the
potential adenocarcinoma in situ.

Part Solid nodules are slightly different. Smaller than 6mm still gets ignored. However, the ones
larger than 6 mm get a 3 month follow up - with interval widening but persisting up to 5 years.
Regular solid nodules typically get set free after 2 years of stability.

                                                    (bronchoalveolar carcinoma).

To make this simple, just think about it on a spectrum with the small pre-invasive lesions on one end
and the invasive adenocarcinoma on the other. That same spectrum follows a relative increase in the
density of the nodule. This is why a growing consolidate component inside a previously existing
ground glass nodule is such a suspicious feature.

Key Concept: The larger the solid component of the "part solid" nodule gets the more likely it is to be
malignant. Partially solid nodules are more likely to be cancer than ground glass nodules.

Superior Sulcus /Pancoast Tumors: Some people make a big                          - ptosis
deal about only using the word "pancoast" when the tumor causes the               (lazy eyelid)
associated syndrome (shoulder pain, C8-T2 radiculopathy, and Homer                - miosis
Syndrome). In my experience most everyone just calls apical tumors                (tiny pupil)
"pancoast" with no regard to symptoms. Having said that, I would
remember "shoulder pain" as a possible hint in the question header.
These things are typically non-small cell cancers.

Staging = MRI is the tool of choice (look at that brachial plexus).

General Contraindication to Surgical Resection (may vary by
institution): invasion of the vertebral body (> 50%), invasion of the
spinal canal, involvement in the upper brachial plexus (C8 or higher),
diaphragm paralysis (infers phrenic nerve C3-5 involvement), distal
mets.

Lung Cancer Staging:

Lung cancer staging used to be different for small cell vs non-small cell (NSCLC). In 2013 the 7th
edition of the TNM made them the same. Below is a chart describing the staging based on tumor
size. For a solid lesion, the size is defined as maximum diameter in any of the three orthogonal planes
- measured on lung window. If the lesion is subsolid, then you define the T classification by the
diameter of the solid component only (NOT the ground glass part).

Pulmonary Vein Anatomy Trivia:
A more detailed look at the staging criteria states specifically
the "intrapericardial portions of the superior and inferior
right and left pulmonary veins, is classified as T4." This

kind of trivial minutia makes great MCQ fodder.

So when is the intrapericadial portion involved ?

The key is to draw a line from the pericardium (arrow) through

the pulmonary vein (dotted black line). Anything deep to that

(checkered in the drawing) is considered T4.                                                      Vocab:

First it is im portant to point out that CT is unreliable for nodal staging. PET-CT is far
superior, regardless o f the size threshold that is chosen. This is why PET is pretty much
always done on lung cancer patients prior to surgical evaluation.

For the purpose o f multiple choice (and real life) the most important anatomy boundary to

consider is the distinction between level 1 nodes (which are N3) and level 2 nodes (which are

N2).

In some cases, this                               Level 1
can literally make                                (N3)

      Typical Contraindications to Lobectomy I Resection

The big issues (things that make lobectomy impossible) are going to be:   Stage 3B implies
· Growth o f the tumor through a fissure                                  N3 or T4 disease
· Invasion o f the Pulmonary Vasculature
· Invasion o f the main bronchus
· Invasion o f both the upper and lower lobe bronchi.

Other findings that will make the tumor NOT resectable:
· N 2 * (if the tum or is > 5cm ) or N3 N odal D isease -- corresponding to a Stage 3B cancer
· Multi-lobar Disease
· Malignant Pleural Effusion

      Trivia: Prevascular Lymph nodes can NOT easily be reached by mediastinoscopy.

Lung Cancer - Treatment:

Wedge Resection vs Lobectomy: This is on the fringe of what should be considered fair
game, and I'm certain the decision varies by institution and the size and composition (percentage of
brass) of the surgeon's testicles. In general, if a stage 1A or IB cancer is peripheral and less than 2cm
they can consider a wedge resection. The advantage to doing this over a lobectomy is preserving
pulmonary reserve. If the tumor is larger than 3cm then lobectomy seems to (in general) be a better
option.

Bronchopleural Fistula:                                      Day 1             Day 2  Days

This is an uncommon complication of pneumonectomy,           Normal - Becomes More Fluid Filled
that has a characteristic look and therefore easy to test.

So normally after a pneumonectomy the space will fill
with fluid. If you see it filling with air then this is the
dead give away.

If you are a weirdo, you could confirm the diagnosis
with a xenon nuclear medicine ventilation study, which
will show xenon in the pneumonectomy space. The
major risk factor is ischemia to the bronchi (disrupted
blood supply from aggressive lymph node dissection,
or using a long bronchial stump).

RFA/MWA Pearl - It is normal to see bubbles in the
lesion immediately after treatment.

Recurrent Disease - Recurrence rates are relatively high (especially in the first 2 years).
From a practical stand point, I always focus my attention towards the periphery of the radiation bed,
regional nodes, and/or the bronchial stump. A usefiil concept is to focus on morphology - radiation
scarring is usually not round. If you see something with a round morphology - especially if it is
growing over time, that is highly suspicious.

Other findings concerning for recurrence:
· Enhancing solid tissue along the resection line (or bronchial stump) which is enlarging over time.
· New enlarged mediastinal nodes with a short axis greater than 1 cm
· New pleural effusion (that persists on follow ups)
