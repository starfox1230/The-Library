                                  Atelectasis

Patterns of Atelectasis:

Atelectasis (incomplete lung expansion) exists on
a scale of severity; ranging from the tiny
horizontal "plate-like" / "discoid" subsegmental
to complete collapse of the lung (lobar).

The degree of collapse depends on the location of
obstruction: peripheral (P) vs central (C).

There are some described vocabulary words for
the different subtypes of atelectasis - and those
words, the supposed mechanisms, and the
attributed causes are all potentially testable.

Trivia:

· Acute atelectasis favors diaphragmatic and mediastinal displacement.

· Chronic atelectasis tends to favor compensatory overinflation of non-atelectatic lung.

 Right Upper Lobe:

 - Closes like a fan attached at the Hilum
 - Horizontal Fissure may bow upward
 - Hilum may elevate
 - The lateral will again show this hilar

    from both the anterior and posterior
    directions.
 - The top half of the oblique fissure will
    be pulled anterior.
