Anatomy Trivia

Cord Blood Supply: There is an anterior blood supply and a posterior blood supply to the cord.
These guys get taken out with different clinical syndromes.

Anterior spinal artery - arises bilaterally as two small branches at the level of the termination of
the vertebral arteries. These two arteries join around the level o f the foramen magnum.

Artery o fAdamkiewicz - This is the most notable                  Anterior
reinforcer o f the anterior spinal artery. In 75%
of people it comes off the left side of the aorta
between T8 and T il. It supplies the lower 2/3
of the cord. This thing can get covered with the
placement o f an endovascular stent graft for
aneurysm or dissection repair leading to spine
infarct.

Posterior Spinal Artery'- Paired arteries which                                    \
arise either from the vertebral arteries or the
posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Unlike the                                 Posterior
anterior spinal artery this one is somewhat
discontinuous and reinforced by multiple
segmental or radiculopial branches.

Conus Medullaris: This is the terminal end of the spinal cord. It usually terminates at around LI.
Below the inferior endplate of the L2 / L3 body should make you think tethered cord (especially if
shown in a multiple choice setting).

Epidural Fat: The epidural fat is not evenly distributed. The epidural space in the cervical cord is
predominantly filled with venous plexus (as opposed to fat). In the lumbar spine there is fat both
anterior and posterior to the cord. "Epidural Lipomatosis " = is a hypertrophy of this fat that onlv
occurs with patients on steroids ("on corticosteroids" would be a huge clue).

Stenosis: Spinal stenosis can be congenital (associated                   B
with short pedicles) or be acquired. The Torg-Pavlov ratio can
be used to call it (cervical canal diameter to vertebral body     Sagittal View
width < 0.85).                                                    B/A < 0.85
Symptomatic stenosis is more common in the cervical spine
(versus the thoracic spine or lumbar spine). You can get some
congenital stenosis in the lumbar spine from short pedicles, but
it's generally not symptomatic until middle age.

Degenerative Changes

W hat is this degenerative change you speak o f ? The best way to understand this is through
two mechanisms; Spondylosis Deformans and Intervertebral Osteochondrosis.

Annular Fissure:

As the disc ages, it tends to dry out making it more friable and easily tom. "Tears" in the annulus
(which are present in pretty much every degenerated disc) aren't called "tears" but instead "fissures".
People who write the papers on this stuff make a big fucking deal about that - with the idea being that
"tear" implies pathology. Fissuring can be asymptomatic and part of the aging process.

Even though fissures are present    "High Intensity Zone" -MR with Fluid Signal in the Annulus
in basically every degenerated
disc you don't always see them
on MRI. What you do see (some
of the time) is a fluid signal gap
in the annulus - which has been
given the official vocabulary
word "High intensity

Zone," and anything with
official vocabulary nomenclature
should be respected as possible
multiple choice fodder.

·Annular fissures may be a source of pain
(radial pain fibers - trigger "discogenic pain") but are also seen as incidentals.
·Fissures are found in all degenerative discs but not all fissures are visualized as HIZs.
·Discography is more sensitive to fissures relative to MRI, but still not 100% sensitive.
·Also, Dude, "Tear" is not the preferred nomenclature - "Fissure."

Moloch the Owl God - after which they issued a proclamation on what vocabulary words you
are and are not allowed to use when describing degenerative disc herniation.

                     Which Nerve is CompressedP

There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves, with each pair eorresponding to the adjacent vertebra - the
notable exception being the "C8" nerve. Cervical disc herniations are less common than lumbar
ones. The question is most likely to take place in the lumbar spine (the same spot most disc
herniations occur). In fact more than 90% of herniations occur at L4-L5, and L5-S1. A tale of
two herniations. It was the best of times, it was the worst of tim es...

Developm ental A nom alies of the N erve Root:

Normally, you have a pair of spinal nerve roots that      Asymmetric anterolateral
leave the dural sac just above the level of the           comer of the dural sac
intervertebral foramen. There are several normal
variants, but the one I want to discuss is the situation
where two nerve roots arise from a single dural

sleeve (conjoined nerve root). This the most

common developmental anomaly of the nerve root.
The surgical significance generally relates to the
mobility of the anomalous nerve roots and issues
related to localization. It can be a source of FBSS
(Failed Back Surgery Syndrome) if it is the source of
pain instead of a disc or even misidentified as a disc
preoperatively. If the surgeon resects the
"disc" (conjoined nerve root) your report will become
"Exhibit A" in the proceeding lawsuit.

The anomaly itself doesn't cause pain (usually) but if it is involved with a pathology that narrows the
foramen (disc bulge, facet disease, etc...) then it becomes your problem to identify. If it goes to
surgery and something goes wrong, the legal standard of care will be followed (i.e. - the Radiologist
will be cast in the role of "Scapegoat" ).

For the purpose of multiple choice, I would look for asymmetry of the anterior-lateral comer of the
dural sac on axial T 1 MM. Altematively, you could be shown a situation where a nerve root is absent
at one level, then duplicated at the level below/above -- another variation of the theme of nerve root
developmental anomalies.

Myelogram Specific - Contrast should flow treely away from the needle tip, gradually filling the thecal
sac. The outlining of the cauda equina is another promising sign that you did it right. If contrast pools at
the needle tip or along the posterior or lateral thecal sac without free-flow, a subdural injection or
injection in the fat around the thecal sac should be suspected.

Technical Strategies to Reduce the Incidence of Post Dural Puncture Headache (PDPH):

· Use a small needle (25 G), especially for epidural pain injections or myelography. You might have

to use a 22G for a diagnostic LP or you are going to struggle to get enough fluid for a sample, and

your opening pressures may not be accurate.

· Non-cutting "atraumatic" needle (diamond shaped tip) reduce incidence o f PDPH

· Replace the stylet before you withdraw the needle. This isn't just for the 1 in a million chance that

you suck a nerve root up in the needle. This has also been shown to reduce incidence o f PDPH
