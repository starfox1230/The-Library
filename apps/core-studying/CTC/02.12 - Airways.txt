Anatomy The basic anatomy o f the trachea is a bunch o f anterior horseshoes o f cartilage,
with a posterior floppy membrane. This membrane can bow inward on expiratory CT (and this
is normal). The transverse diameter should be no more than 2.5 cm (same as the transverse
diameter o f an adjacent vertebral body). It's normally 1 - 3 mm thick.

Saber-Sheath Trachea:
Coronal diameter o f less than two thirds the sagittal diameter.

I say "saber-sheath trachea," you say COPD.

Trivia: The main bronchi will be normal in size.
          The tracheal wall will be normal in thickness.

                                                                                                                     Saber Sheath

                  Tracheal Disease Game Plan: Three big questions to ask:
                  (1) Does it involve the posterior membrane ?
                  (2) is it focal or diffuse ? and
                  (3) Are there calcification ?

                Relapsing Polychondritis: Spares the posterior membrane. Diffuse
anterior and lateral thickening of the trachea. No calcifications. Characterized by recurrent
episodes of cartilage inflammation, and recurrent pneumonia.

Wegener's: Circumferential thickening, which can be focal or long segment.
No calcifications. Subglottic involvement is common.

Tracheobronchopathia Osteochondroplastica (TBO):

Spares the posterior
membrane.

You have
development of
cartilaginous and
osseous nodules
within the submucosa
of the tracheal and
bronchial walls.

                      TBO - Note the sparing of the posterior membrane (arrow)

Amyloidosis: Irregular focal or short segment thickening, which can involve the posterior
membrane. Calcifications are common.

Carcinoid          Tracheal / Bronchial Tumors Continued

                Tumors o f the trachea are not common in the real world.

                       Extremely rare in the trachea (< 1%).
                       More typically seen Endobronchial
                       Carcinoids usually have a central endobronchial location
                       (although they can rarely be found in the pulmonary parenchyma-
                       presenting as a nodule or mass in an older patient).
                       Pulmonary carcinoid tends to be slow growing and locally
                       invasive (only met to nodes about 10% o f the time).
                       No surprise they can cause obstructive symptoms. They can also
                       cause hemoptysis because they are highly vascular.
                       For the purpose of multiple choice = No association with smoking
                       (**there maybe an association with the atypical sub-type)
                       An octreotide scan can be used to localize a carcinoid tumor.
                       PET can be falsely negative in ~ 25% o f cases (they can be cold

                       The valvular degradation that occurs tends to be on the left side
                       (mitral and aortic), as opposed to the GI carcinoid syndrome
                       which targets the right side (tricuspid and pulmonic).

Adenoid Cystic      Most common tracheal malignancy

Subglottic Stenosis

Post Intubation Stenosis - is the most common cause o f
subglottic tracheal stenosis in an adult.

Classic Look: Focal Subglottic circumferential stenosis,
with an hourglass configuration.

            Fuckery: If you see imaging signs that clearly suggest
            subglottic stenosis but are told the patient has never been
            intubated -- then you are looking at the rare case of adult
            croup (acute laryngotracheobronchitis) - which can also give
            this appearance.

Cystic Fibrosis - The sodium pump doesn't work and they end up with thick secretions and
poor pulmonary clearance. The real damage is done by recurrent infections.

Things to know:
     Bronchiectasis (cylindrical - progresses to varicoid)
     It has an apical predominance (lower lobes are less affected)
     Hyperinflation

· Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension-
     Mucus plugging (finger in glove)

Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia: Those little hairs in your lungs that clear secretions don't

work. You end up with bilateral lower lobe bronchiectasis (remember that CF is mainly upper lobe).
Other things these kids get is chronic sinusitis (prominent from an early age), and impaired fertility
(sperm can't swim, girls get ectopics). They have chronic mastoid effusions, and conductive hearing
loss is common (those little ear nerve hair things are fucked up too). An important testable fact is
that only 50% of the primary ciliary dyskinesia patients have Kartagener's Syndrome.

Mounier-Kuhn (Tracheobronchomegaly)                                           Mounier-Kuhn--
If you ever say to yourself "that's one big fucking trachea" - this
is the diagnosis. Defined by a massive dilatation of the trachea     Note the Big Fucking Trachea
(> 3cm). It's not well understood and probably the result of a
gypsy curse. "Mounier-Kuhn" sounds like a gypsy curse to me.

The recommended therapy in most cases of a gypsy curse is to
keep the paw of a dead rabbit (3 years old) under your pillow from
the day you feel the first symptoms until the third full moon -
although that is probably beyond the scope of the exam.

                                  Small Airways Disease

Bronchiolitis - This is an inflammation of the small airways. It can be infectious (like the viral
patterns you see in kids) or inflammatory like RB-ILD in smokers, or asthma in kids.

A ir Trapping - When you see areas of lung that are more lucent than
others - you are likely dealing with air trapping. Technically, air
trapping can only be called on an expiratory study as hypoperfusion in
the setting of pulmonary arterial hypertension can look similar. Having
said that, for the purpose of multiple choice test taking, 1want you to
think (1) bronchiolitis obliterans in the setting of a lung transplant, or
(2) small airway disease - asthma / bronchiolitis.

Tree in Bud - This is a nonspecific finding that can make you think
small airway disease. It's caused by dilation and impaction of the
centrilobular airways. Because the centrilobular airways are centered
5-10 mm from the pleural surface, that's where they will be. It's
usually associated with centrilobular nodules.

Follicular Bronchiolitis - This is an                         Small Airway Disease
inflammatory process seen in rheumatoid
arthritis or Siogrens. It's not well understood and   Infectious        Tree-in-bud
is related to lymphoid hyperplasia. It looks like     Bronchiolitis
centrilobular ground glass nodules with scattered                       Smokers. Centrilobular
areas of bronchial dilation.                          RB-ILD            ground glass nodules

Constrictive Bronchiolitis - This is
another inflammatory process that can be seen in      Sub-Acute         Inhaling dust / other misc
viral illness, transplant patients, drug reactions,   Hypersensitivity  garbage. Centrilobular
or inhalation injury. It is also often identified in  Pneumonitis       Ground glass nodules
patients with DIPNECH. It occurs secondary to
mononuclear cells which form granulation tissue       Follicular        RA and Sjogrens.

Stroked-out old people and                   Aspiration Patterns
drunks love to aspirate.          (depends on what you aspirated)

aspiration. May favor the right   Aspiration of Germs         para-pneumonic effusion, empyema,

The most common complication      Aspiration of Oil           Lipoid Pneumonia. Low density
is infection which can manifest   (often mineral oil)
as an empyema
(which can then get a broncho­
pleural fistula).
