Mets: Mets to the heart and pericardium are much more common than primary cardiac tumors (30x
more common). Also, not surprising, a cancer eating into the side of your heart has a poor prognosis
(Las Vegas hookers, cocaine, and vengeance against your enemies should be considered).

The pericardium is the most common site affected (by far). The most cormnon manifestation is a
pericardial effusion (second most common is a pericardial lymph node). Melanoma may involve the
myocardium.

 Trivia: Most common met to the heart is lung cancer (pericardium and epicardium)
 Trivia: Melanoma has the highest percentage of cases that met to the heart.

Fuckery: Watch the language of the cardiac met question -- overall lung is more common (because
lung cancer is fairly common). However, melanoma has a higher percentage of cardiac involvement.
"Creative" (deliberate attempt to trick you) wording on the question should be closely scrutinized.
Mumble to yourself "Godless cocksuckers" as you correctly navigate these attempts to deceive you.

Angiosarcoma: Most common primary malignant tumor of the heart in adults. They like the RA
and tend to involve the pericardium. They often cause right sided failure and/or tamponade. They are
bulky and heterogenous. Buzzword is "sun-ray" appearance which describes enhancement
appearance of the diffuse subtype as it grows along the perivascular spaces associated with the
epicardial vessels.

Left Atrial Myxoma: Most common primary cardiac                        THIS VS THAT:

tumor in adults (rare in children). They are associated with       Tumor vs Thrombus:

may be calcified. They may prolapse through the mitral
valve. They will enhance with Gd (important                    Tumor will enhance
discriminator from a thrombus).                                Thrombus will NOT enhance.

Rhabdomyoma: Most common fetal cardiac tumor. It is a hamartoma. They prefer the left
ventricle. Associated with tuberous sclerosis. Most tumors will regress spontaneously (those NOT
associated with TS are actually less likely to regress).

Fibroma: Second most common cardiac tumor in childhood. They like the IV septum, and are
dark / dark on T1/T2. They enhance very brightly on perfusion and late Gd.

Fibroeiastoma: Most common neoplasm to involve the cardiac valves (80% aortic or mitral).
They are highly mobile on SSFP Cine. Systemic emboli are common (especially if they are on the
left side).
