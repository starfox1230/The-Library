Cancer: Biopsy o f the prostate is a terrible terrible situation, worse than anything you can
imagine in 1000 years of hell. MRI o f the prostate (instead o f biopsy) is probably a little better
although many sites use an endorectal co il.. .my God this endorectal coil! You can use prostate
MRI for high risk screening (high or rising PSA with negative biopsy), or to stage (look for
extracapsular extension).

First, let's talk about prostate anatomy: Anatomists like to use      A denocarcin om a:
"zones" to describe locations, and it actually helps with             Peripheral Zone: 70%
pathology. The anterior fibromuscular gland is dark on T1 and         Transition Zone: 20%
T2. The central and transitional zones (together called the           Central Zone; 10%
"central g la n d ") are brighter than the anterior muscular zone,
but less bright than the peripheral zone on T2. In other words
the peripheral zone is the most T2 bright.

Prostate Cancer Continued:

M R lfinding fo r Prostate CA: C an cer is d a rk on T2 (background is h ig h ), restricts on
diffusion (low on ADC), and enhances early and washes out (type 3 curve - ju st like a breast
cancer).

Dark on T2                   Dark on ADC          Enhances
                        (restricts diffusion)

Bone scan is the money for prostate mets (vertebral body mets).

Trivia: PSA can be useful when considering risk o f bone mets. There is at least 1 paper that
says a PSA < 20 has a high predictive value in ruling OUT skeletal mets. In other words,
PSA tends to be high when disease is aggressive enough to go to the bones.

Staging: The main                 Stage II                      S tage III
thing to know is
stage II vs stage III,  Confined by capsule (T2)  Extension through capsule (T3a)
as extra capsular
extension is the        Abutment of the capsule         Bulging o f the capsule,
most important                without bulging       or frank extension through it
factor governing
treatment.

Seminal vesicles (T3b) and the nerve bundle are also right behind the prostate and can get
invaded (urologists love to hear about that).

PSA, Gleason Score, and PI-RADS

Key Concept: Prostate Cancer is a lot like Breast Cancer - in that it is  Clinically Significant Cancer:
very common and often a "benign" entity ( l i n 6 men will be diagnosed
with prostate cancer , 3% will die of it). There are tons and tons of     Gleason Score > 7
elderly people with low grade prostate CA and breast cancers (DCIS)
that will never even know they have it unless somebody does a biopsy      Cancer Volume > 05cc
on them... or worse performs screening on them. Which brings us to
the PSA. When family medicine doctors started doing PSA checks on         Extension through the Capsule
everybody suddenly there was this enormous spike in the incidence of      (loss of normal T2 signal in the
prostate cancer. Suddenly everyone has cancer (I blame the liberal        seminal vesicle, bulging of the
media).                                                                   capsule / frank invasion through
                                                                          it, loss of fat between prostate
Who Dies of Prostate Cancer ? There are 3 factors - Gleason Scores        and rectum, neurovascular
8-10, Advanced Clinical Stage (mets), and PSA > 20. People with           bundle asymmetry).
Gleason scores less than 6, PSA < 10, and staging < 2a (less than half
the lobe) are unlikely to die of the prostate cancer.

Management ? It is gonna depend a lot on who you ask. Most people will add hormone therapy around stage
2B (more than half the lobe) but it is complicated.

PSA: This is an antigen produced by the normal prostate and incorporated into the ejaculate (from the window
to the wall), for the purpose of dissolving cervical mucus etc... It also leaks out into the blood in small amounts
in normal men and in larger amounts when the prostate is abnormal (cancer, infected, riding a bicycle, sticking
stuff up your ass that don't belong up your ass, and benign hypertrophy).Family Medicine docs willscreen
people starting at 50. Some numbers to have a vague familiarity with include: Normal < 4.Low Risk Category
< 10. High Risk Category > 20. After prostatectomy normal is zero, if it rises to 0.2 think recurrence. After
radiation anything over 2.0 is concerning for recurrence (although it's a little more complicated than that). PSA
< 20 = bone mets unlikely.

Gleason: There is a "grade" a "score" and a "group" - you better fucking believe the distinction is fair game..

 Gleason Grade: This refers to the histological patterns in the sample " 1" is normal, "5" is very very not
  normal. 2-4 are in the middle.

 Gleason Score: This is the sum of the two most common "grades." The more common pattern is always first.
  So "A" 3+5 = 8, and "B" 5-1-3 = 8. "B" has more of 5 than "A" and is therefore worse off. Total scores less
  than 6 aren't usually reported.

 Gleason Group: This uses pattern scores to reflect the actual risk. This removes the confusion over one 7
  being worse than another 7. For example 3+4 is grade 2, and 4+3 is grade 3. Grade is 1-5

PI-RADS: Scores are calculated by using data from DWI, T2, and Enhancement. Tumor in the Transition zone
is determined primarily from T2 (t for t). Peripheral zone is determined primarily from DWI.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): Obviously this is super common, and makes
old men pee a lot. Volume o f 30cc is one definition. M ost com m only involves the
transitional zone (cancer is rare in the transitional zone - 10%). The central gland enlarges
with age. The median lobe com ponent is the one that hypertrophies and sticks up into the
bladder. It can cause outlet obstruction, bladder wall thickening (detrusor hypertrophy), and
development o f bladder diverticulum.

          The IVP buzzw ord is "J shaped", "Fishhook", or "Hockey stick" shaped ureter - as
          the distal ureter curves around the enlarged prostate.
