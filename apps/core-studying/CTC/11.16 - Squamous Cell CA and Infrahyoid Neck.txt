When you are talking about head and neck cancer, you are talking about squamous cell cancer.
Now, this is a big complex topic and requires a fellowship to truly understand / get good at.
Obviously, the purpose o f this book is to prepare you for multiple choice test questions not
teach you practical radiology. If you want to actually learn about head and neck cancer in a
practical sense you can try and find a copy o f H am sberger's original legendary handbook
(which has been out o f print for 20 years), but who has time for that ? Now, for the trivia....

I touched on this once already. Just remember smoker/drinker in an old person. HPV in a
young person. Necrotic level 2 nodes can be a presentation (not a branchial cleft cyst).

Laryngocele:

When the laryngeal "saccule" dilates with air you call it a
laryngocele. If it is filled with fluid you still might call it a
larygocele (but if saccular cyst is a choice - consider that). If it
is filled with fluid and air you still might call it a larygocele
(but if laryngopyocele is a choice -- and you have any hint of
infection - consider that).

What thefuck is a "saccule " ? The "saccule" is the                   version of this (based on
appendix of the laryngeal ventricle (a blind ending sac that          containment of violation of
extends anterior and upwards). It's usually closed or                 the thyrohyoid membrane).
minimally filled with fluid (you don't typically see it in
normal adults).

Why does it dilate ? Usually because it's obstructed (ball-
valve mechanics at the neck of the saccule), and the testable
point is that 15% of the time that obstruction is a tumor.
You can also see them in forceful blowers (trumpet players,
glass blowers) -- well maybe, this depends on what you
read. Simply read the mind of the question writer to know if
they are on team trumpet player laryngocele.

Vocal Cord Paralysis:

The involved side will have an expanded ventricle (it's the opposite side with a cancer). If you see
it on the lefl:, a good "next step" question would be to look at the chest (for recurrent laryngeal nerve
involvement at the AP window).

            Buzzword = "Hoarseness" - If you see "Hoarseness" in the question header, you need to
             think recurrent laryngeal nerve compression in the AP Window - either from a mass/node
             or aortic path. ^Hoarseness is also a classic Laryngeal CA buzzword (so look there too).

The role of the Radiologist is not to make the primary cancer diagnosis here, but to assist in staging.
Laryngeal cancers are subdivided into (a) supraglottic, (b) glottic, and (c) subglottic types.
"Transglottic" would refer to an aggressive cancer that crossesth ela cal ventricle.
