Hydrometrocolpos -

Essentially the vagina w on't drain the uterus. This condition
is characterized on imaging by an expanded fluid-filled
vaginal cavity with associated distention o f the uterus.

You can see it presenting in infancy as a mass, or as a
teenager with delayed menarche.

Causes include imperforate hvmen (most common'), vaginal
stenosis, lower vaginal atresia, and cervical stenosis.

For multiple choice trivia think about this as a "midline pelvic  Bladder
mass" , which can cause hydronephrosis (mass effect from
distended uterus).

                                                                  the contralateral / normal

to a mass. In a child, torsion can occur with a normal ovary,
secondary to excessive mobility o f the ovary. As described       If there is a mass - it is
in the GYN chapter you are going to see an enlarged               probably a mature cystic
(swollen) ovary, with peripheral follicles, with or without       teratoma or large follicular
arterial flow. W hat is "enlarged" ? Unlike an adult you          cyst. It is almost never a

(ovarian volumes in the peds setting are notoriously
variable).

The solution is to compare the ovary in question to the           Normal xorsion - Big (3x the size)
contralateral size. Suspect torsion if the ovarv is at least 3                with fluid-debris levels in
times the size of the opposite "normal" ovary.                                displaced follicles
Fluid-Debris Levels within the displaced follicles is
another described adolescent ovarian torsion finding.

Masses: About two-thirds o f ovarian neoplasms are benign dermoids/teratomas (discussed in
detail in the GYN chapter). The other one third are cancer -- usually germ cells (75%). Mural
nodules and thick septations should clue you in that these might be cancer. Peritoneal implants,
ascites, and lymphadenopathy, are all bad signs and would over-ride any benign characteristics
of the mass.

                         Random Scrotum Trivia

Hydrocele: Collection o f serous fluid and is the most common cause o f painless scrotal
swelling. Congenital hydroceles result from a patent processus vaginalis that permits entry of
peritoneal fluid into the scrotal sac.

Complicated Hydrocele (one with septations): This is either a hematocele vs pyocele. The
distinction is clinical.

Varicocele: Most o f these are idiopathic and found in adolescents and young adults. They are
more frequent on the left. They are uncommon on the right, and if isolated (not bilateral) should
stir suspicion for abdominal pathology (nutcracker syndrome, RCC, retroperitoneal fibrosis).

``Next Step " - Isolated right-sided varicocele = Abdomen CT

                                                              Exclude extrinsic mass, renal vein thrombus, or
                                                              portal hypertension causing a splenorenal shunt

HSP: This vasculitis is the most common cause o f idiopathic scrotal edema (more on this in the
vascular chapter).

                 Acute i*aiu in or around the Scrotum

The top three considerations in a child with acute scrotal pain are (1) torsion of the testicular
appendage, (2) testicular torsion, and (3) epididymo-orchitis.

Epididymitis - The epididymal head is the most common part involved. Increased size and
hyperemia are your ultrasound findings. This occurs in two peaks: under 2 and over 6. You can
have infection of the epididymis alone or infection o f the epididymis and testicle (isolated orchitis
is rare).

Orchitis - Nearly always occurs as a progressed epididymitis. When isolated the answer is
mumps.

Torsion of the Testicular Appendages - This is the most common cause o f acute
scrotal pain in age 7-14. The testicular appendage is some vestigial remnant o f a mesonephric
duct. Typical history is a sudden onset o f pain, with a Blue Dot Sign on physical exam (looks like
a blue dot). Enlargement o f the testicular appendage to greater than 5 mm is considered by some
as the best indicator o f torsion

Torsion of the Testicle - Results from the testis and spermatic cord twisting within the
serosal space leading to ischemia. The testable trivia is that it is caused by a failure o f the tunica
vaginalis and testis to connect or a "Bell Clapper Deformity". This deformity is usually bilateral,
so if you twist one they will often orchiopexy the other one. If it was 1950 you'd call in your
nuclear medicine tech for scintigraphy. Now you just get a Doppler ultrasound. Findings will be
absent or asymmetrically decreased flow, asymmetric enlargement, and slightly decreased
echogenicity of the involved ball.

                                                                234
Testicular & Extra-Tesdcular Masses

Testicular Masses can be thought of as intratesticular or            Rhabdomyosarcoma
extratesticular. With regard to intratesticular masses,        History: Painless, afebrile,
ultrasound can show you that there is indeed a mass but        scrotal swelling - age 5.
there are no imaging features that really help you tell which
one is which.                                                  Look: Heterogenous vascular
                                                               extra-testicular mass
If the mass is extratesticular, the most likely diagnosis is

an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma from the spermatic

cord or epididymis. -----    ^

Testicular Mircolithiasis - This appears as multiple

small echogenic foci within the testes. Testicular microlithiasis
is usually an incidental finding in scrotal US examinations
performed for unrelated reasons. It might have a relationship
with Germ Cell Tumors (controversiaP. Follow-up in 6 months,
then yearly is probably the recommendation (maybe - it's very
controversial, and therefore unlikely to be asked).

               Not Really Reproductive But It Is Pelvic

Sacrococcygeal Teratoma:
This is the most common tumor o f the fetus or infant. These soUd and/or cystic masses are
typically large and found either on prenatal imaging or birth. Their largeness is a problem and
can cause mass effect on the GI system, hip dislocation, and even nerve compression leading to
incontinence.
They are usually benign (80%), although those presenting
in older infants tend to have a higher malignant potential.
The location o f the mass is either:
 external to the pelvis (47%),
 internal to the pelvis (9%), or
 dumbelled both inside and outside (34%).
There is another classification that discusses involvement
of the abdomen.
The easiest way to remember it is like this:
-Type 1 - Totally extra pelvic
-Type 2 - Barely pelvic, but not abdominal
-Type 3 - Some abdominal
-Tvpe 4 - Totally inside abdomen
** this one has the highest rate o f malignancy.

Trivia: They have to cut the coccyx off during resection.
Incomplete resection o f the coccyx is associated with a
high recurrence rate.
