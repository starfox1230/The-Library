PRES [Posterior Reversible Enceptiaiopathy Syndrome]:

Classic Features:

 Asymmetric cortical and subcortical white matter
   edema (usually in parietal and occipital regions
   *but doesn't have to be - superior frontal sulcus is
   also common).

 Does NOT restrict on diffusion (helps tell you it's not
   a stroke).

Etiology: Poorly understood auto regulation fuck up.             Vasogenic Edema Pattern
Classic History: Acute Hypertension or Chemotherapy.       Bilateral, Posterior, Mildly Asymmetric

                   PostChemotlierapy:

It is fairly common. There are lots of named offenders. Methotrexate seems to be the one people
write the most papers about (especially in kids with ALL)

There are two main looks:

(1) PRES - As above, chemo is a classic cause. BUT! It tends to have a "non-classic" look relative
    to the hypertension type. It will often spare the occipital lobes, and instead target the basal
    ganglia, brainstem, and cerebellum.

(2) Leukoencephalopathy (treatment induced): The classic look would be centered in the
    periventricular white matter - bilateral, symmetric, coni!uent, T2/FLAIR bright changes (history
    is obviously key to the diagnosis).

Other Misc Trivia:
 Can progress to brain atrophy.
 "Mineralizing Microangiopathy " - the vocab word to use if there are calcifications

 "`'Disseminated necrotizing leukoencephalopathy " - severe white matter changes, which
  demonstrate ring enhancement, classically seen with leukemia patients undergoing radiation
  and chemotherapy. It is bad news and can be fatal (it believes in nothing Lebowski).

                   176
                          Post Radiation:

The quick and dirty version is that after radiation therapy to the brain you can see T2 bright areas
and atrophy corresponding to the radiation portal. You can also see hemosiderin deposition and
mineralizing microangiopathy (calcifications involving the basal ganglia and subeortical white
matter). There is a latent period, so imaging findings don't typically show up for about two months
post therapy. N ow... if you want to get crazy, you can discuss changes at different time periods.

Acute          Too rare to give a fuck about (at least for the test)

(Days-Weeks):

Early Delayed The classic look is similar to chemo - high T2/FLAIR     This is reversible
(1-6 months): signal in the periventricular white matter.              change (usually).

Late Delayed   Described as a "mosaic" pattern with high WM signal     Progressive... but
(6 months):    changes again favoring the deep white matter. Can       reversible (mosdy)
               appear "mass-like" and expansile.

               Classically sparing of the U-Fibers & Corpus Callosum.

Long Term      Radiation-Induced Vasculopathy: Strokes and Moya-Moya type of look.
Sequela
               Mineralizing Microangiopathy - 1mentioned this on the previous page. This is a
               delayed finding -- like two years following treatment. Think calcifications (basal
               ganglia and subcortical white matter) - hence the term "mineralizing."

               Radiation-Induced Vascular Malformations: The most classic types are capillary
               telangiectasias / cavernous malformations. The most classic scenario is a kid
               getting whole brain radiation for ALL. Remember the key finding is blooming on
               GRE/SWI sequences.

               Radiation-induced Brain Cancer:
                XRT is the "most important risk factor" for primary CNS neoplasm.
                Most common type is a meningiomas (70%) - usually seen ~ 15 years post XRT
                More aggressive types Gliomas, Sarcomas, etc, have a shorter window < 10 years

            Chasing the Oragon" - Heroin inhalational leukoencephalopathy

W
Most toxic leukoencephalopathies (either from chemotherapy, immunosuppressives, antibiotics,
or the aristocratic art of paint thinner huffing) all create a similar non-specific pattern of widespread
high T2/FLAIR signal in the supra and infratentorial white matter. The "Chasing the Dragon"
pattern is also not specific - but it does have a catchy name, so people love collecting cases of it to
show in conference ("catchy name" = high yield for boards).
