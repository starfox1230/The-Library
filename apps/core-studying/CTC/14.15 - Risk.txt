                              RISK

Estrogen: The more exposure to estrogen, the higher your        Estrogen Related Risks
risk of breast cancer. Anything that prolongs this exposure is
said to increase risk. For example, an early age to begin       Early Menstruation
menstruating or a late age to have menopause. Hormone           Late Menopause
replacement therapy with estrogen alone obviously increases     Late age of first
exposure. Early maturation of lobules, which can be achieved    pregnancy / or no kids.
by getting pregnant young, reduces your risk. Being fat         Being Fat
increases estrogen exposure (more aromatase = more              Being a Drunk
estrogen). Being a drunk increases estrogen exposure - via      Hormone Replacement
messing with its normal breakdown in the liver.                 (with estrogen)

H igh Risk Lesions: Any of the high risk lesions (ADH, ALH, LCIS, Radial Scar, Papilloma)
are associated with an increased risk. These are discussed more in detail later in the chapter.

Density: Density is considered a "medium risk," and is "dose dependent" with the denser you
are the more risk you have.

Chest Wall Radiation: Chest wall radiation (usually seen in lymphoma patients) is a big risk
factor, especially at a young age. The risk is supposed to peak around 15 years post treatment.
If the child had more than 20 Gy to the chest she is going to qualify for an annual
screening MRI - at age 25 or 8 years post exposure (whichever is later).

Relatives with Cancer: A first degree relative with breast cancer increases your lifetime risk
from 8% to 13%. Two first degree relatives increases your risk to 21%.

Actual Mutations:

BRCAl                     Chromosome 17. More common than type 2. Increased risk
                          for breast, ovary, and various GI cancers.
BRCA2
Li Fraumeni               Chromosome 13. Male carriers have a higher risk with 2.
Cowden Syndrome           Increased risk for breast, ovary, and various Gl cancers.

                          kinds of rare cancers.

Breast Cancer Risk Models:

There are several risk models, which have pros/cons and differences. I apologize in advance
for even suggesting you learn about these.... but it just seems testable to me. I'm sorry...

Gail Model           Oldest and most          Focuses on personal      Doesn't use genetics
                     validated breast cancer  risk factors, biopsy of  (it's too old school).

                 High Yield Take Home Points Regarding Risk:

    Anything that gets you more estrogen increases your risk
    BRCA 1 is more common than BRCA 2 (in women).
    Men with BRCA 2 get more cancer than men with BRCA 1.
    Breast Density is an independent risk factor (denser the breast, the more the risk)
D 20 Gy of Radiation to your chest as a kid buys you a screening MR] - at 25 or 8
    years after exposure (*whichever is later)
D Cowden Syndrome - Bowel Hamartoma, Follicular Thyroid Cancer, Lhermitte-
    Duclos, and Breast Cancer
D All current risk models underestimate life time risk.
D Tyrer Cuzick is the most comprehensive risk model, but does not include breast
    density.
D Exercise (probably more like not being fat) reduces the risk of breast cancer
    Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (SERMs) reduce incidence of ER/PR positive cancers.
    Mortality may not actually be reduced {soundfamiliar?).

                           Screening Controversy

A red glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky as the dark lord of statistics Gilbert
Welch published his now infamous and devious work - "Effect o f three decades o f
screening mammography on breast-cancer incidence, " in the unscrupulous New England
Journal of Medicine.
"I can make things move without touching them. I can make animals do what I want
without training them. I can make had things happen to people who are mean to me. I can
make them hurt, ifI want... " - Gilbert Welch when asked about his thoughts on screening
mammography.
This loathsome, maleficent, and repugnant study (along with several other large heavily
powered studies) have brought into question the practice of screening mammograms. I
highly recommend you read these "'despicable'' papers, but please wait till after the exam,
because the people who write multiple choice questions about mammography are
definitely not the same people who wrote these papers.
For the purpose of multiple choice tests, screening mammography saves lots of lives, you
should buy pink ribbons, and low grade DCIS in a 95 year old needs a surgical consult.
