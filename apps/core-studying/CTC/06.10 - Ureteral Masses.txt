Transitional Ceil Carcinoma (Urotiielial Carcinoma) -                        RISK FACTORS

This histologic subtype makes up a very large majority (90%) of the          Smoking
collecting system cancers. Imaging buzzword is "goblet" or                   Azo Dye
"champagne glass sign" on CT IVP.                                            Cyclophosphamide

                                                                             Aristolochic acid (Balkan

-- a way to remember this is where ever the urine sits static the longest    Horseshoe Kidney
is more likely to have the cancer.                                           Stones
So: Bladder > Renal Pelvis > Ureter. If you are getting cancers in the       Ureteral
ureter than you probably also have them in the bladder                       Pseudodiverticulosis

Ureter is the least common location for TCC of the urinary tract             Hereditary Non-Polyposis
TCC of the renal pelvis is 2x -3x times more common than ureter              Colon Cancer (type 2)

TCC of the bladder is lOOx times more common than ureter

In the ureter 75% of the TCCs are in the bottom 1/3

If you have upper tract TCC there is a 40% chance of developing a bladder TCC

If you have bladder TCC there is a 4% chance of developing a Renal Pelvis or Ureteral TCC

Ureteral TCC is bilateral 5%

Balkan Nephropatiiy - This is some zebra degenerative nephropathy endemic to
the Balkan States. The only reason I mention it is that it has a super high rate of renal
pelvis and upper ureter TCCs. It's thought to be secondary to eating aristolochic acid
(AA) in seeds of the Aristolochia clematitis plant (herb).

Squamous Cell - This is much less common than TCC (in the US anyway). The major
predisposing factor is schistosomiasis (they both start with an "S").

Hematogenous Metastasis - Mets to the ureters are rare but can occur (GI, Prostate, Renal,
Breast). They typically infiltrate the periureteral soft tissues and demonstrate transmural
involvement.

Fibroepitlielial Polyp - This is a benign entity presents as a filling         THISvsTHUT:
defect in the renal pelvis or proximal ureter - which mimics a TCC (blood
clot or radiolucent stone). The diagnosis is typically made post              P olp         TCC
nephrectomy - since the assumption is nearly always TCC.                                    Older
                                                                             Younger       (60-70)
Gamesmanship: For the purpose of multiple choice (and real life), renal      (30-40)       Irregular
pelvis filling defects should always be assumed to be either clot, calcium
(stone), or cancer. The only way I can think that a polyp question could be  Smooth /        Fixed
ask would be something like "which features would make a polyp more           Oblong
likely?" It has to be a trivia question, they couldn't (in good conscious)
expect you to pick polyp over TCC with imaging alone -- even if the           Mobile
findings and demographics were perfect - that would be teaching a terrible
clinical message.
