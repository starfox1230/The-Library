Craniosynostosis

"Craniosynostosis" is a fancy word for premature fusion o f one or several o f the cranial
sutures. The consequence o f this premature fiasion is a weird looking head and face (with
resulting difficulty getting a date to the prom). Besides looking like a gremlin (or a cone­
headed extraterrestrial forced to live as a typical suburban human), these kids can also have
increased intracranial pressure, visual impairment, and deafness.

There are different nam ed types depending on the suture involved - thus it's w orth spending
a moment reviewing the names and locations o f the normal sutures.

Sutures normally have a serrated (saw tooth) contour
With early closure the suture will lose the serrated appearance - becoming more dense
and sharp. Eventually the suture will disappear completely.
For the purpose o f multiple choice, you should think about synostosis (early closure) as
likely syndromic - and focus your memorizing on this point.
Having said that, sagittal and unilateral coronal synostosis are typically idiopathic

Lytic Skull Lesions:

Lytic skull lesions in kids can come from a couple o f different things (LCH, Infection, Mets,
Epidermoid Cysts, Leptomeningeal Cysts, etc...). The two I want you to focus on are LCH and
the Leptomeningeal Cyst (which I will discuss later in the chapter).

LCH (Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis) - Too many fucking dendritic cells - with local invasion. It
is a sorta pseudo m ahgnancy thing. N obody really understands it .... For the purpose o f the exam
think about this as a beveled hole in the skull. The skull is the m ost common bone involved with
LCH. It is a pure lytic lesion (no sclerotic border). The beveled look is because it favors the
inner table. It can also produce a sequestrum o f intact bone ("button sequestrum).

A Gamesmanship: If they tell you (or infer) the kid has neuroblastoma
          - think about a met.

                                                                 156
Parietal Foramina

                   These paired, mostly round, defects in the
                   parietal bones represent benign congenital
                   defects. The underlying cause is a delayed or
                   incomplete ossification in the underlying
                   parietal bones.

                   They can get big and confluent across the
                   midline. Supposedly, (at least for the big ones
                   > 5mm) they are associated with cortical and
                   venous anomalies.

Wormian Bones

In technical terms, there are a bunch o f extra squiggles around the lambdoid sutures.
"Intrasutural Bones" they call them.

                                                         These things are usually idiopathic - however, if

Skull Fractures

Accidental (and non-accidental) head trauma is supposedly (allegedly, allegedly) the most common
cause of morbidity and mortality in children. As you might imagine, the pediatric skull can fracture
just like the adult skull - with linear and comminuted patterns. For the purpose of multiple choice, I
think we should focus on the fracture patterns that are more unique to the pediatric population:
Diastatic, Depressed, and "Ping-Pong"

· Diastatic Fracture: This is a fracture along / involving the suture. When they intersect it is usually
   fairly obvious. It can get tricky when the fracture is confined to the suture itself The most common
   victim of this sneaky fracture is usually the Lambdoid, followed by the Resident reading the case on
   night float .. .with Attending backup (asleep in bed). How does one know there is traumatic injury to
   a suture ? Classically, it will widen. This is most likely to be shown in the axial or coronal plane so
   you can appreciate the asymmetry ( > 1 mm asymmetry relative to the other side).

· Depressed Fracture: This is a fracture with inward displacement of the bone. How much inward
   displacement do you need to call it "depressed" ? Most people will say "equal or greater to the
   thickness of the skull." Some people will use the word "compound" to describe a depressed
   fracture that also has an associated scalp laceration. Those same people may (or may not) add the
   word "penetrating " to describe a compound fracture with an associated dural tear.
   Will any o f those people be writing the questions ? The dark side clouds everything. Impossible to
   see the future is.

· Ping Pong Fracture: This is actually another subtype of depressed fracture but is unique in that it is
   a greenstick or "buckle" type of fracture. Other potentially testable differences include:

      · Outcomes: Ping Pong fractures typically have a favorable / benign clinical outcome
        (depressed fractures have high morbidity).

      · Etiology: Diastatic and depressed fracture types usually require a significant whack on
        the head. Where as "ping pong" fractures often occur in the setting of birth trauma
        (Mom's pelvic bones +/- forceps).

      · Imaging Appearance: Ping Pong fractures are hard as fuck to see. To show this on a
        test you'd have to have CT 3D recons demonstrating a smooth inward deformity. You
        could never see that shit on a plain film. I can't imagine anyone being a big enough
        asshole to ask you to do that. Hmmm.... probably.

 4 ^ NEXT STEP:                                                                 THIS vs THAT:
         Depressed Fx
                                                                     Fi acturc   Normal
Unlike linear fractures (which usually heal without complication),    > 3mm      Suture
depressed fractures often require surgery. Some general indications
for surgery would include:                                                       < 2mm

· Depression of the fragments > 5mm (supposedly fragments more       Wide Center Equal Width
  than 5mm below the inner table are associated with dural tears),
                                                                     "Darker"    "Lighter"
· Epidural bleed
                                                                      Straight   Squiggly
· Superinfection (abscess, osteomyelitis)                            Line, with  Line, with
                                                                      Angular
· "Form" (cosmetic correction to avoid looking like a gargoyle),                  Curves
                                                                       Turns
· "Function" (if the frontal sinus is involved, sometimes they need
  to obliterate the thing to avoid mucocele formation).

Leptomeningeal Cyst - ``Growing Skull F racture"

A favorite of board examiners since the Cretaceous Period.

Typical Pathogenesis:                                                        IZ

- Step 1; You fracture your noggin,                         AND
   tear the underlying dura.

- Step 2: Leptomeninges herniate through the tom dura       mto

the fracture site.

Step 3: Over time (a few months) CSF
pulsations progressively widen the
fracture site and prohibit normal healing.

Step 4: You know you shouldn't, but you        Initial ^               2 Moonnths
just can't resist the urge to poke your own    Film                    Later
brain through the now cavernous cranial
defect.

Step 5: The poking triggers a powerfiil hallucinogenic experience. You have a telepathic
conversation with a room filled with self transforming elf machines.
You are overwhelmed with tremendous curiosity about exactly
what/who they are and what they might be trying to show you.

Step 6: You develop epilepsy from poking your brain too much.
Or was it not enough? - you can't remember

Sinus Pericranii

A rare disorder that can be shown as a focal skull defect with an associated vascular malformation. The
underlying pathology is a low flow vascular malformation - which is a communication between a dural
venous sinus (usually the superior sagittal) and an extra cranial venous structure via the emissary veins.
It is not classically associated with discoloration of the overlying skin.

Most likely way to show this:

(1) MRI - with some type of vascular sequence
     post contrast or MRA/TOF.

(2) CT showing the skull defect - wanting a next step  Skull Defect +
     (ultrasound or MRI to demonstrate the vascular    Vascular
     component).                                       Malformation
