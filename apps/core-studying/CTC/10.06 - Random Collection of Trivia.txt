R a n d o m A s s C o l l e c t io n o f T rivia

Liposclerosing Myxofibroma:

Very characteristic location - at the intertrochanteric region o f the femur.
Looks like a geographic lytic lesion with a sclerotic margin. Despite non-
aggressive appearance, 10% undergo malignant degeneration so they need to
be followed.

Osteochondroma:                                                                                 /
                                                                                 *Awayfrom Joint
Some people think o f this as more o f a developmental anomaly (although
they still always make the tumor chapter). Actually, it's usually listed as the
most common benign tumor ("exostosis"). They can be radiation induced,
making them the only benign skeletal tumor associated with radiation.

They have a very small risk o f malignant transformation (which supposedly
can be estimated based on size of cartilage cap).
Supposedly a cap > 1.5 cm is concerning.

Key Points:
· They point away from the joint (different than Trevor / DEH)
· The bone marrow flows freely into the lesion - seen best on T1 MRI
· They can classically poke the popliteal artery and cause a pseudo aneurysm

Multiple Hereditary Exostosis:

AD condition with multiple osteochondromas. They can be sessile or pedunculated.
They have an increased risk of malignant transformation.

Trevor Disease (Dysplasia Epiphysealis Hem im elica - DEH):

This is a disease characterized by the development o f osteochondromas at the epiphysis which
result in significant joint deformity (most common in ankle and knee) -- making you terrible
at tennis and soccer. Instead o f pointing away from the joint (like a normal osteochondroma)
these assholes point into the ioint -- this is why you have so many joint issues. You see this in
young children. The osteochondroma looks more like an irregular mass. They tend to be treated
with surgical excision.

Supracondylar Spur (Avian Spur):                               Avian Spur

This is an Aunt Minnie, and normal variant. This is an   Ligament o f
osseous process, that usually does nothing, but can      Struthers
compress the median nerve if the Ligament of
Struthers smashes it.                                     Supracondylar
                                                          Canal
Notice this thing points towards the joint, that is how
you know it is not an osteochondroma. Also - it is not
a Trevor Disease thing - because of
(1) the characteristic location and
(2) it is not originated from the epiphysis.

Periosteal Chondroma (Juxta-Cortical
Chondroma): When you see a lesion in the finger of
a kid think this. It's a rare entity, o f cartilaginous origin.
"Saucerization" o f the adjacent cortex with sclerotic
periosteal reaction can be seen.

O steofibrous Dysplasia: This is a benign lesion found exclusively in the tibia or
fibula in children (10 and under - usually). It looks like an NOF , but is centered in the
anterior tibia, and has associated anterior tibial bowing. It can occur with Adamantinoma,
and the two cannot be differentiated with imaging.

When 1 say looks like NO F in the anterior tibia with anterior bowing, you say Osteofibrous
Dysplasia.

Distal Fem oral M etaphyseal Irregu larity (C ortical Desmoid):

This is a lucency seen along the back o f the
posteriomedial aspect o f the distal femoral
metaphysis. If they show you a lateral knee x-
ray, and there is an irregularity or lucency on the
back o f the femur this is it. It's often bilateral.

Buzzwords include "Scoop like defect" with an
"irregular but intact cortex."

This is a total incidental finding and is a don't
touch lesion. D on't biopsy it, D on 't M RI it.

Just leave it alone. If you really want to know,       Cc 't'<M [>:;; noid - Scoop Like Defect
it's probably a chronic tug lesion from the
adductor magnus.

C alcium H yd ro xyap atite: M ost pathologic calcification in the body is calcium
hydroxyapatite, which is also the m ost abundant form o f calcium in bone.

Calcium hydroxyapatite deposition disease = calcific tendinitis.

The calcium is deposited in tendons around the joint. The m ost com mon location for
hydroxyapatite deposition is the shoulder. Specifically, the supraspinatus tendon is the
most frequent site of calcification, usually at its insertion near the greater tuberosity. The
longus colli muscle (the muscle anterior to atlas -> T3) is also a fa vo rite location fo r multiple
choice test writers. It may be primary (idiopathic) or secondary. Secondary causes worth
knowing are: chronic renal disease, collagen-vascular disease, tumoral calcinosis and
hypervitaminosis D.

O steo p o ikilo sis: It's ju st a bunch o f bone islands. Usually in epiphyses (different from
blastic mets or osteosarcoma mets). It can be inherited or sporadic but if you are forced to
pick a pattern - I 'd go with autosom al dominant.

Mets Osteopoikilosis - Osteopoikilosis tends to be joint centered (clustered around
centered). Sclerotic mets will be all over the place. Sclerotic mets believe in nothing
Lebowski.

Trivia - Osteopoikilosis patients tend to be keloid formers.

O steopathia S triata: Linear, parallel, and longitudinal lines in
m etaphysis o f long bones. D oesn't mean shit (usually - but can in some
situations cause pain).

   E n geim ann's D isease: This is also know n as progressive diaphyseal

%  dysplasia or PDD. What you see isfusiform bony enlargement with sclerosis of

   the long bones (diaphyses). This is a total zebra that begins in childhood.

superior articular surface, beginning more anteriorly.

Paget Disease (O steitis Deformans):

A relatively common condition that affects 4% o f people at 40, and 8% at 80 (actually 10%,
but easier to remember 8%). M > F. M ost people are asymptomatic. The pathophysiology o f
Paget is not well understood.

THIS vs THAT Pagets Spine vs Other Spine Changes

Pagets - This is discussed in detail in the M SK chapter, but is such a high yield topic that it's
worth touching on again. The incidence increases w ith age (around 8% at age 80). It's at
increased risk for fracture, and has a 1% risk of sarcoma degeneration (usually high grade).

It's shown two ways in the spine:                                Picture
          (1) An enlarged "ivory vertebrae",              · - Frame
          (2) Picture frame vertebrae (sclerotic border)
          -- - with central lysis {mixedphase)

Renal Osteodystrophy - Another high yield topic covered in depth in the M SK chapter. The
way it's shown in the spine is the "Rugger Jersey Spine" - w ith sclerotic bands at the top and
bottom o f the vertebral body. You could also have paraspinal soft tissue calcifications

This V5 That: Rugger Jersey vs "Paget" Picture Frame;

· Rugger Jersey = Top and Bottom Only
· Paget Picture Frame = All 4 margins o f the vertebral body

Osteopetrosis - A nother high yield topic covered in depth in the M SK chapter. This is a
genetic disease with impaired osteoclastic resorption. You have thick cortical bone, with
diminished marrow. On plain film or CT it can look like a Rugger Jersey Spine or Sandwich
vertebra but the sclerotic lines are said to be less smudgy and more well-defined/sharp
(supposedly). On M R you are going to have loss o f the norm al T1 bright m arrow signal, so it
will be T1 and T2 dark.

"H-Shaped Vertebra" - This is usually a buzzword for sickle cell, although it's
only seen in about 10% o f cases. It results from microvascular endplate infarct.
If you see "H -Shaped vertebra," the answ er is sickle cell. If sickle cell isn't a
choice the answ er is Gauchers. A nother tricky w ay to ask this is to say w hich o f
the following causes "widening of the disc space." W idened disc space is
another way o f describing a "H Shape" without saying that.

N uclear M edicine: The prim ary utility o f a bone scan is in
defining the extent o f disease and to help assess response
to treatment. The characteristic look for Paget is "W hole

teaching is that Paget is hot on all three phases (although
often decreased or normal in the sclerotic phase).
