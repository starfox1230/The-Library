runners who run on hard surfaces. The thing to know is
that just like in the wrist (scaphoid), the navicular is high
risk for AVN.

which is fairly common. Classically seen in military

SNAC Wrist (Scaphoid Non-Union Advanced

Just remember that the scaphoid always wants to
rotate in flexion - the scaphoid-lunate ligament is the
only thing holding it back. If this ligament breaks it
will tilt into flexion, messing up the dynamics of the
wrist. The radial scaphoid space will narrow, and the
capitate will migrate proximally.

Treatment depends on the occupation/needs of the
wrist. Wrist fusion will maximize strength, but cause
a loss of motion. Proximal row carpectomy will
maximize ROM, but cause a loss of strength.

Scapholunate Ligament Tear:

The Terry Thomas look (gap between the scaphoid and lunate) on plain film.

There are actually 3 parts (volar, dorsal, and middle), with the dorsal band being the most
important for carpal stability. If they tear the caipals will migrate away from each other.

        THISvsTHOr-DISIvsVISI

This topic can be very confusing. Here is the way I like to think about it.

I imagine two people (Lunate and Scaphoid) standing on                       S-L Ligament
opposite sides o f a very steep hill. At the apex o f the hill is
a man named "Scapholunate Ligament" - 1 agree, it's a              Lunate
strange name. His parents were probably vegetarians.

This hill is very steep, so Scapholunate Ligament has              DORSAL              VOLAR
grabbed each of the people (Lunate and Scaphoid) by the            DORSAL            VOLAR
hand - he was worried they might fall. In fact, the only
thing keeping these two people from tumbling down the
hill is the insane grip strength o f Scapholunate Ligament
(rumor has it he can close a #3 Captain o f Crush - which
would certify him as an official Captain of Crush).

By using this analogy perhaps you can infer that if you
have carpal ligament disruption, the carpal bones will
rotate the way they naturally want to (down the hill).
The reasons for their rotational desires are complex but
basically have to do with the shape o f the fossa they sit
on.

Just remember the scaphoid wants to flex (rock volar)
and the lunate wants to extend (rock dorsal). The only
thing holding them back is their ligamentous attachment
to each other.

Anatomic Trivia - Triangular Fihrocartilage Complex -- TFCC

I'll begin by saying that this is arguably the most complex anatomy in the entire body
(maybe second only to the posterior lateral comer). A detailed understanding is well
beyond the scope o f the exam (probably...). Having said that, the TFC is specifically
m entioned on the official study guide, so we need to at least talk about it.

The TFCC functions as the primary stabilizer and shock absorber o f the distal radial ulnar
joint (DRUJ). The TFCC is critical for a range o f activities (doing a pushups , punching
General Zod, etc...).

W rist Tendon (EPL) Rupture, 3 W eeks A fter Radial Fracture:

Fracture of the distal radius can result in an irregular morphology of the dorsal radial tubercle (Lister's
Tubercle). This irregular morphology can make the bone "rough and scratchy" and lead to a classic
delayed (3 weeks - 3 months) rupture of the 3rd extensor tendon (EPL). As a point of testable trivia,
this is more common after a non-displaced fracture.

With regard to the extensor tendons, there are four
things to know:

There are 6 extensor compartments
(5 fingers + 1 for good luck).

     First compartment (APL and EPB) are the ones                 Radius
     affected in de Quervain's

· Third compartment has the Extensor Pollicis
     Longus (EPL) which courses beside Lister's
     Tubercle. This is the one that has delayed
     rupture after a non-displaced radial fracture.

· The sixth compartment (Extensor Carpi Ulnaris) - can get an early tenosynovitis in RA

What goes through the carpal tunnel finore easily
asked as "what does N O T go through ")?

Knowing what is in (and not in) the caipal tunnel    Does NOT go through Tunnel
is high yield for muhiple choice testing. The        · -Flexor Carpi Radialis
tunnel lies deep to the palmaris longus, and is      · -Flexor Carpi Ulnaris
defined by 4 bony prominences (pisiform,             · -Palmaris Longus (if you have one)
scaphoid tubercle, hook of hamate, trapezium         · -Flexor Pollicis BREVIS
tubercle), with the transverse carpal ligament
wrapping the contents in a fibrous sheath.

The tunnel contains 10 things

· 4 Flexor D. Profudus (FDP)

· 4 Flexor D. Superficialis (FDS)

· 1 Flexor Pollicis Longus (FPL), and

· 1 Median Nerve

The Flexor Carpi Radialis (FCR) is NOT truly in the tunnel. The extensor tendons are on the other side of
the hand. Note that Flexor Pollicis Longus (FPL) goes through the tunnel, but Flexor Pollicis Brevis does
not (it's an intrinsic handle muscle). Palmaris longus (if you have one) does NOT go through the tunnel.

The presence or absence of an intratendinous septum (between the EPB
and APB) tendons - is a prognostic factor. If it's absent, this will nearly
always resolve with conservative treatment alone.

repetitive trauma causes scarring in the flexor tendon
sheath. The fancy word is "stenosing tenosynovitis." This
is most commonly shown with ultrasound. If they showed
you a hand ultrasound think about this.

Another common area o f "stenosing tenosynovitis" is at the
ankle specifically the flexor hallucis longus tendon around
the ankle in patients with the os trigonum syndrome.

T u ft F ra c tu re : a tuft fracture (tip of the finger injury) that also has involvement of the

nail bed will be treated like an open fracture (meaning it will get antibiotics). You see a tuft
fracture - next step - you ask the ER to correlate for a nail bed injury.
