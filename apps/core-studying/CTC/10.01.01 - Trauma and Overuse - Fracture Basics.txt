                               Phases of Fracture Healing:

Physiology PhDs will describe 3 phases o f bone healing (Inflammatory, Reparative, and
Remodeling). From a R adiologist's perspective the m ost im portant thing to understand
about this process is that around 7-14 days granulation tissue will be forming betw een the
bone fragments. This results in an increased lucency o f the fracture site related to bone
resorption.

             In other words, a healing fracture will be MORE LUCENT at 7-14 days.

This explains the disclaimer cowardly Radiologists throw out when they are afraid they
missed a fracture "Consider Repeat in 7-10 days, " The idea is that in 7-10 days, you
should be able to see the fracture line , if one is p re s e n t, because o f the increase in bone
lucency that occurs normally in the healing process.

Fracture Healing Continued -                                      Phalanges = Heal Fast (3 Weeks)
                                                                   Tibia = Heal Slow (10 Weeks)
In general, bones heal in about 6-8 w eeks, but is location         Everything Else = 6-8 weeks
dependent. Healing is the fastest in the phalanges
(around 3 weeks), and the slowest is either the tibia or
femoral neck/shaft - depending on what you read
(around 2-3 months). Proper healing requires stability,
good blood supply and nutrition.

THIS THAT - C om pressive Side vs T e n s ile Side:

 This comes up in two main areas - the femoral neck and the tibia.
 · Fractures of the Compressive side are constantly pushed back together - these do well.
 · Fractures of the Tensile side are constantly pulled apart - these are a pain in the ass to heal.

     often called "'dreaded

SONK (Spontaneous Osteonecrosis of the Knee):

This is totally named wrong, as it is another type of
insufficiency fracture. You see this in old ladies with
the classic history o f "sudden pain after rising from
a seated position." Young people can get it too
(much less common), usually seen after a meniscal
surgery.

Key Factoids:
· It's an insufficiency fracture (NOT

  osteonecrosis) think SINK not SONK
· Favors the medial femoral condyle

  (area of maximum weight bearing)
· Usually unilateral in an old lady without

  history of trauma
· Associated with meniscal injury
