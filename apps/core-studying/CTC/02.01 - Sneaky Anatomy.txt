Let us explore some of the various forms of fuckery that can be deployed.

THIS vs THAT:                        There are several methods for distinguishing between
                                     the right and left hemidiaphragm.
Right Hemidiaphragm vs Left
                                                                         Method 1: The Stomach
                                                                        Bubble -- The left

                                                                         is directly above the
                                                                         stomach, so you can try look

                                       Often the left diaphragm will be a little higher than the
                                       right in this region.

   Left has the bubble under it      Method 2: The Silhouette Sign -- If two

                                     appear to extend forward as much as the right one)
Right Ribs vs Left
                                     Method 3: Height -- If height mattered the giraffe
                                     would be the king of the jungle, but it is still useful for
                                     determining which diaphragm is left vs right.
                                     Normally the highest peak is on the right (solid hne).

                               The greater the distance between
                               the beam and the film, the more

Normal Hilum on Lateral:

"The Dark Hole" -- A classic anatomy
question is to identify the left upper lobe
bronchus on the lateral view. It appears
as the "Dark Hole" and represents looking
down the barrel of the tube.

The posterior wall of the bronchus
intermedius runs through the black hole,
and can be thickened by edema (or
"oedema" if you speak the
Queen's radiology jargon).

Right and Left PA:                                                  Left in the Back
                                                                    "L"osers in the Back
If you put your finger in the
"Dark Hole "- which is the
left upper lobe bronchus,
in front of it will be the right
PA, and overtop of it will be
the left PA.

The main pulmonary artery on the right passes anterior to the
right main bronchus, whereas the left pulmonary artery passes
posteriorly - hooking up and over the left main bronchus.

Retrotracheal Triangle (Raider Triangle):

This is the dark triangle behind the trachea on a lateral chest
radiograph. It sits on top the aortic arch and is bordered
anteriorly by the back wall of the trachea, and posteriorly by the
upper thoracic vertebral bodies.

The triangular space is supposed to be    V
clear (black). When it is white - it has
something in it. In the real world that
something can be almost anything
(goiter, zenker, etc..).

For the purpose of multiple choice
tests, an opacitv in the Raider
Triangle is an Aberrant ri^ht
subclavian artery.

                                    The aberrant right subclavian artery is the classic multiple choice
                                    cause of an obliterated retrotracheal triangle. This vessel arises
                                    from the rear end of the arch before crossing the mediastinum,
                                    left to right, posterior to the esophagus and trachea -- more on
                                    this in other chapters.

               The Frontal CXR "The Family Medicine Doctors View"

THIS vs THIIT:
Anterior Ribs vs Posterior Ribs

· Anterior ribs (black) have a more sloping
  course as the move medially.

· Posterior ribs (white) have a horizontal
  course. You see the horizon (horizontal) at
  thefarthest point (posterior).

· The anterior ribs are generally not seen as
  well as the posterior ribs.

           In many cases, you can simply memorize one item o f trivia (in this case that the horizontal ribs are
           seen posterior -- "horizon is in the back''). Then the other one (the anterior ribs) are the other one
           (the ones that aren't horizontal). "The other one is the other one" is one o f the most useful toolsfo r
          memorizing large amounts o f material.

Normal Hilum on Frontal:                                        Truncus Anterior

This is the right hilar anatomy on the frontal        Superior

Notice the right major fissure is

A = Horizontal (Minor) Fissure,
B = Right Major (Oblique),
C = Left Oblique

Azygos Lobe Fissure - This is considered variant anatomy. These things happen when the azygos
vein is displaced laterally during development. The result is a deep fissure in the right upper lobe.
It's not actually an accessory lobe but rather a variant of the right upper lobe. If they show you one, I
suspect the question will revolve around the pleura. Something like "how many layers o fpleura? "
The answer is 4.
