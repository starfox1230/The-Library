Normal Anatomy:

The spaces around the kidneys have names and are easily tested in the form of multiple choice questions;
including the classic "what space is this ? " - arrow on a space question. As this is the laziest possible way
to write a GU question it is the most likely one to be asked. As is often the case with anatomy, this stuff
can get pretty fucking complicated (lots of synonymous terms and potential spaces) so I'm gonna try and
break it down for you -- like a cardboard box that I'm folding up nicely to put in the recycling.
Now I've analyzed this anatomy with a team o f Victoria secret underwear models, who all came to one
unanimous conclusion: that renal fascia is super boring. After this careful analysis, I decided to try and
explain this piss in 5 stages ~ then a bit more in section 2. Notice I called it "piss" because this is GU.

Part 1: Overly Simplified Spaces (Shaded Areas) - Note the vocab: pararenal and perirenal spaces
I've deliberately over simplified these spaces in a way that I think lends itself most easily to "what space
is this ?" and "what is in this space ? " style of lazy multiple choice questions.

Posterior Pararenal Space Perirenal Space                         Anterior Pararenal Space

Part 2: Fascial Borders to the Spaces (dotted lined and arrows)

Next let us consider that the named fascial bands could be asked in the form of "what makes up the
border ?" and "what is thisfascia s French sounding surname ? " Lets go front to back:

The distinction between "PERI" renal & "PARA" renal spaces is critical knowledge for MCQ trivia

That is probably good enough.... probably. Now for normal renal anatomy.

The normal adult kidney is shaped like a bean,            Column
with a smooth (often lobulated) outer border. The         of Bertin
kidney is surrounded by a thick capsule outlined
by echogenic perirenal fat. This echogenic fat is           Medulla
contiguous with the renal sinus, filling the middle         (Pyramid)
of the kidney. The cortex extends centrally into
the middle of the kidney, separated by slightly                Papilla
less echogenic medullary pyramids. The normal                   (tip of medulla
kidney should be between 9 cm and 15 cm in                      projecting into
length.                                                         calyx)

The echogenicity of the kidney should be equal to
or slightly less than the liver and spleen. If the
renal echogenicity is greater than the liver, this
indicates some impaired renal fijnction (medical
renal disease). Liver echogenicity significantly
greater than the kidney indicates a fatty liver.

Variant flnatomy and Renal Pseudomasses:

Dromedary Hump:

Focal bulge on the left kidney, which forms as the
result of adaptation to the adjacent spleen.
It can simulate a mass, but once you've seen
a few you won't be fooled as easily.

Prominent (or hypertrophied)
Column of Bertin:

Normal variant in which hypertrophied cortical tissue located
between the pyramids results in splaying of the sinus. Other
than the hypertrophy it looks totally normal. It will enhance
the same as adjacent parenchyma. The classic location is
between the upper and middle calyces
(or just remember - the middle third).

This is a "pseudo-scar" that looks like an echogenic line seen in the upper
1/3 of the kidney. It is basically only seen on ultrasound in the longitudinal
plane.

Fetal Lobulation; The fetal kidneys are subdivided into lobes that are separated with grooves.
Sometimes this lobulation persists into adult life. The question is always:

Renal Agenesis;

Congenital absence o f one or both kidneys.

When it is bilateral you should think about the "Potter Sequence," which to my utter
disappointment never ends with the development o f magical skills. It does give you hypoplastic
lungs - which I imagine could be remedied with gillyweed [ref 1 - Magical Water Plants o f the
Highland Lochs].

When it is unilateral it is typically sporadic and often asymptomatic. Having said that, for the
purpose o f muhiple choice you'll need to consider the various forms o f fuckery that can be
associated with this:

surgically absent vs congenitally absent.

          Renal Contrast Phases and Related Trivia

The kidneys drink contrast in a predictable order and their appearance changes accordingly. This
has implications for pathologic sensitivity (looking for tumor, vs urine leak, or urothelial lesions,
etc...etc... so on and so forth). Plus, it could be the source of multiple choice trivia - so I'm
compelled and honor bound to discuss it.

There are 4 possible "normal" looks the kidneys can give you:
