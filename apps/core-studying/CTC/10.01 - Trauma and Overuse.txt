                               Phases of Fracture Healing:

Physiology PhDs will describe 3 phases o f bone healing (Inflammatory, Reparative, and
Remodeling). From a R adiologist's perspective the m ost im portant thing to understand
about this process is that around 7-14 days granulation tissue will be forming betw een the
bone fragments. This results in an increased lucency o f the fracture site related to bone
resorption.

             In other words, a healing fracture will be MORE LUCENT at 7-14 days.

This explains the disclaimer cowardly Radiologists throw out when they are afraid they
missed a fracture "Consider Repeat in 7-10 days, " The idea is that in 7-10 days, you
should be able to see the fracture line , if one is p re s e n t, because o f the increase in bone
lucency that occurs normally in the healing process.
