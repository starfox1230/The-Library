                 SECTION 7:

                 DONG BONE

Could also be referred to as the "Penis. "
Anatomy o f this thing in cross section:

                                                            Superficial Fascia
                                                                Deep Fascia

                                                              Tunica Albuginea

Urethra                                            Corpus Cavernosum
                                            Corpus Spongiosum

Fractured Penis: This is one o f the most tragic situations that can occur in medicine.
There are several potential mechanisms o f injury. Anecdotally, it seems to be most common
in older men participating in extra-marital relations with strippers named "Whisper." There
is at least one article stating "im potence" is protective - w hich m akes sense if you think
about the pathophysiology.

They can show it on ultrasound (look for hematoma) or MRI.

Key Trivia: Defined by fracture o f the corpus
cavernosum and its surrounding sheath, the tunica
albuginea (black line outlining the dong bone).

Cartooned T1 axial through the D ong Bone (Penis):

Interruption of the black line (tunica albuginea) - arrow.

It's helpful to look for hemorrhage (T1 bright) in the

corpus cavernosum (the primary stabilizing strut o f this                       N

battering ram).

Stigmata of this injury can include a sub optimal
angulation (Peyronie disease) from fibrous scar formation.
