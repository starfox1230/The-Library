Multiple Sclerosis:

White matter patterns can be confusing as there are tons of
overlapping non-specific features. To help understand this (and
avoid being tricked) let me introduce a few concepts. White matter
lesions come in a few patterns. MS is the poster child o f the
"perivascular pattern." This pattern favors involvement of the
juxtacortical and periventricular regions with lesions that have
ovoid and/or fiisiform morphology.

                 Ovoid, Fusiform                                    (1) Juxtacortical

Size can be helpful. A single lesion > 15 mm                        Vascular  Perivascular
in size suggests the underlying etiology is not                     Pattern   Pattern (MS)

                                                 Corpus Callosum RARE         COMMON

"not vascular." When you think "not vascular     Juxtacortical      RARE      RARE

When you think demyelinating you should          Infratentorial     RARE

McDonald Diagnostic Criteria for MS:

This was last revised in 2010, so it's kind o f an old M cDonald's Diagnostic Criteria.

· And on his criteria he had a section o f lesions disseminated in space (periventricular,
  juxtacortical, infratentorial, spinal cord) - more than 1 in at least 2 o f these locations.

· And on his criteria he had a section on dissemination in tim e: best shown as a T2 bright lesion
  that does enhance (active) and a T2 bright lesion that does not enhance (in-active) -- lesions
  are in different phases o f the disease and therefore separated by time.

Epidemiological trivia:

· Usually targets women 20-40 (in children there is no gender difference).
· There are multiple sub-types with the relapsing-remitting form being the most common (85%).
· Clinical history o f "separated by time and space'' is critical.

                                                 178
Additional M S Related Trivia:

· Most Classic Finding: T2/FLAIR oval and periventricular perpendicularly oriented lesions.
· Involvement of the calloso-septal interface is 98% specific for MS (and helps differentiate it from

  vascular lesions and ADEM).
· In children the posterior fossa is more commonly involved.
· Brain atrophy is accelerated in MS.
· Solitary spinal cord involvement can occur but it is typically seen in addition to brain lesions.
· The cervical spine is the most common location in the spine (65%).
· Spinal cord lesions tend to be peripherally located.
· FLAIR is more sensitive than T2 in detection ofjuxtacortical and periventricular plaques.
· T2 is more sensitive than FLAIR for detecting infratentorial lesions
· MR spectroscopy (more discussion later) will show reduced NAA peaks within the plaques.
· Two or more oligoclonal IgG bands in cerebrospinal fluid is associated with MS
· Aquaporin 4 is associated with neuomyelitis opitica (NMO)

Active vs Not Active : Acute demyelinating plaques should enhance and restrict diffusion (on
multiple choice tests and occasionally in the real world).

Tumor MS: You can sometimes get a big MS plaque that looks like a tumor. It will ring
enhance but classically incomplete {like a horseshoe), with a leading demyelinating edge.

Tumor = Complete Ring  Demyelination = Incomplete Ring

Multiple Sclerosis Variants:

ADEM (Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis): Typically presents in childhood or
adolescents, after a viral illness or vaccination. Classically has multiple LARGE T2 bright
lesions, which enhance in a nodular or ring pattern (open ring). Lesions do NOT involve the
calloso-septal interface.

Acute Hemorrhagic Leukoencephalitis (Hurst Disease): This a fulminant form o f ADEM with
massive brain swelling and death. The hemorrhagic part is only seen on autopsy (not imaging).

Devics (neuromyelitis optica): Transverse Myelitis + Optic Neuritis.
                                          Lesions in the Cord and the Optic Nerve

Marburg Variant: Childhood variant that is fulminant and terrible leading to rapid death. It
usually has a febrile prodrome. "M A rB U R G !!!" = DEATH

CADASIl (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts & Leukoencephalopathy)
Basically it is SAE in a slightly younger person (40), with migraines.

Classic Scenario: 40 year old presenting with migraine headaches, strokes, then eventually
dementia. CADASIL is actually the most common hereditarv stroke disorder.

Classic Imaging Findings: Severe white matter disease (high T2/FLAIR signal) involving multiple
vascular territories, in the frontal and tem poral lobe. The occipital lobes are often spared. Temporal
lobe involvement is classic.

                            Dementia Disorders:

I touched on this briefly in the nukes section -- this is a more in depth discussion.
FDG PET for dem entia is a worthless and expensive com ponent o f the workup. Like most
imaging exams it is ordered with no regard to the impending collapse o f the health care
system under crippling rising costs (with inevitable progression into a M ad Max style
dystopian future or even better M ega-City 1). As such, it is standard practice in most
academic centers to obtain the study.
The idea is that "dem ented brain" will have less perfusion and will have less metabolism
relative to "not dem ented brain." PET can assess perfusion (>5O-H20) but typically it uses
i^FDG to assess m etabolism (which is analogous to perfiision). Renal clearance o f '**FDG is
excellent, giving good target to background pictures. R esolution o f PET is superior to
SPECT.
HMPAO, and ECD (tracers that are discussed in more depth in the nukes chapter) can also be
used for dementia imaging and the patterns o f pathology are the same.
It's im portant to rem em ber that external factors can affect the results; bright lights
stimulating the occipital lobes, high glucose (>200) causes more competition for the tracer
and therefore less uptake, e tc .. .etc... so on and so forth.

Before we begin with the subtypes, a quick pearl:
On FDG P E T the m otor strip is always preserved
in a degenerative type o f dementia.
