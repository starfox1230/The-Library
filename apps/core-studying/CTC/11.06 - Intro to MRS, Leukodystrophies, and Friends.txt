Introduction to MRI Spectroscopy

The old joke in Neuroradiol ogy is if you need to use MRS to figure something out, then you need to
go back and read the book again - starting at page 1. Someone told me that's Yousem's joke, but I
don't see how that is possible - because it's actually a little funny. Regardless of who made the joke
first, there is near universal acceptance that MRS is "of limited clinical utility" (a worthless turd).
Therefore, it is fair game for an intermediate level exam and we should at least talk about it a little.
For now, I'm going to give a very basic overview and emphasize the pathology / clinical trivia. Then
I'll be sprinkling more MRS in sporadically throughout the chapter.

O ven'iew: The general idea is that the various metabolites which exist on the cellular level (choline,
lactate, N-acetylaspartate "NAA," etc... etc.. so on and so forth...) occur in different concentrations
depending on the pathology. For example, "NAA" is a neuronal marker. Things that destroy neurons
(like tumors) will decrease NAA. So, in general the lower the NAA the higher the grade tumor.

You will see a graph like this one, with "PPM" on the X-Axis, and "Intensity" on the Y-Axis.

Intensity is                     Creatine               NAA   Normal

                                      4.0 ppm 3.0 ppm 2.0 ppm 1.0 ppm

PPM stands for parts per million. Better understood as a percent of the Larmor Frequency
(1 ppm = 1 millionth of the Larmor frequency). This is important because each metabolite will
have a unique frequency distribution. For example NAA is at 2.0 ppm.

Why are the numbers counting backwards on the scale ? I'm going to answer this with the same
explanation I received as a small child when I asked why I couldn't just eat my dessert first, and my
vegetables last -- "because I 'm your mother that's why!"

Hunter's Angle: This is a method to quickly                     Reversed Hunter's
decide if the MRS is normal or not. Under                       Angle in a High Grade
normal conditions Choline, Creatine, and NAA                  ^ Glioma (GBM)
should ascending in that order. Using a line to
connect the tips gives you a 45 degree~ish angle.
If it slopes the other way (as shown) then it is
not normal.

Leukodystrophies & Frienils

On the prior page, I introduced the vocab work "dj;smyelinating" disease. Leukodystrophies are the classic
example of this group of pathologies. Technically speaking Leukodystrophies can occur from deficiencies
in lysosomal storage, peroxisomal function, or mitochondrial dysfunction. I'm gonna hit on mitochondrial
diseases separately as they tend to be more asymmetric and favor the grey matter. Whereas the classic
fonns target the white matter in a more symmetric and extensive manner.

The distinction between the Leukodystrophy subtypes is totally academic mental masturbation, since they
are all untreatable and fatal. Therefore, distinguishing between them is fair game on an intermediate level
exam (and specifically listed on the official study guide).

Leukodystrophies & Friends

As discussed on the prior page Leukodystrophies can occur from deficiencies in lysosomal storage,
peroxisomal function, or mitochondrial dysfunction. The classic forms tend to target the white matter in a
more symmetric and extensive manner. This is different than mitochondrial diseases which are more
asymmetric and favor the grey matter. Grey Matter needs more oxygen than White Matter (and White
Matter needs more oxygen than trial lawyers). Inability to process oxygen (mitochondrial dysfunction) -
helps me remember the grey matter > white matter thing.
