TB

You can think about TB as either;
(a) Primary, (b) Primary Progressive, (c) Latent or (d) Post Primary / Reactivation.

· Primary: Essentially you inhaled the bug, and it causes necrosis. Your body attacks and forms a
    granuloma (Ghon Focus). You can end up with nodal expansion (which is bulky in kids, and less
    common in adults), this can calcify and you get a "Ranke Complex. " The bulky nodes can
     actually cause compression leading to atelectasis (which is often lobar). If the node ruptures you
     can end up with either (a) endobronchial spread or (b) hematogenous spread - depending on if the
     rupture is into the bronchus or a vessel. This hematogenous spread manifests as a miliary pattern.
     Cavitation in the primary setting is NOT common. Effusions can be seen but are more
     common in adults (uncommon in kids).

· Primary Progressive: This term refers to local progression of parenchymal disease with the
     development of cavitation (at the initial site of infection / or hematogenous spread). This primary
    progression is uncommon - with the main risk factor being HIV. Other risk factors are all the
    things that make you immunosuppressed - transplant patients, people on steroids. The ones you
     might not think about is jejunoileal bypass, subtotal gastrectomy, and silicosis. This form is
     similar in course to post primary disease.

· Latent: This is a positive PPD, with a negative CXR, and no symptoms. If you got the TB
    vaccine, you are considered latent by the US health care system/industry if your PPD converts.
    This scenario buys you 9 months of INH and maybe some nice drug induced hepatitis.

· Post Primary (reactivation): This happens about 5% of           Immune Reconstitution
    the time, and describes an endogenous reactivation of a
     latent infection. The classic location is in the apical and  inflammatory Syndrome:
    posterior upper lobe and superior lower lobe (more
    oxygen, less lymphatics). In primary infection you tend       The story will be a patient with
    to have healing. In post primary infection you tend to        TB and AIDS started on highly
    have progression. The development of a cavity is the          active anti-retroviral therapy
    thing to look for when you want to call this. Arteries        (HAART) and now doing worse.
    near the cavity can get all pseudoaneurysm'd up -             The therapy is steroids.
    "Rasmussen Aneurysm" they call it - in the setting of a
    TB cavity.

Pieurai involvement witii TB: This can occur at any time after initial infection. In primary TB
development of a pleural effusion can be seen around 3-6 months after infection - hypersensitivity
response. This pleural fluid is usually culture negative (usually in this case is like 60%). You have
to actually biopsy the pleura to increase your diagnostic yield. You don't see pleural effusions as
much with post primary disease, but when you do, the fluid is usually culture positive.

High Yield Factoids Regarding TB:
    Primary = No Cavity, Post Primary / Primary Progressive = Cavity
    Ghon Lesion = Calcified TB Granuloma ; sequela of primary TB
    Ranke Complex = Calcified TB Granuloma + Calcified Hilar Node ; Healed primary TB
    Bulky Hilar and Paratracheal Adenopathy = Kids
     Location for Reactivation TB = Posterior / Apical upper lobes, Superior Lower Lobes
    Miliary Spread when? - Hematogenous dissemination (usually in the setting of reactivation), but
    can be in primary progressive TB as well
    Reactive TB Pattern (Cavitation) seen in HIV patient when the CD4 is > 200
    Primary Progressive Pattern (Adenopathy, Consolidation, Miliary Spread) in HIV is CD4 < 200
    TB does NOT usually cause a lobar pattern in HIV

               Non Tuberculous Mycobacteria:

Not all m ycobacterium is TB. The two non-TB forms w orth know ing are m ycobacterium
avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) and Mycobacterium Kansasii. I find that grouping
these things into 4 buckets is most useful for understanding and remembering them.

Cavitary ("Classic") - This one is usually caused by MAC. It favors an old white man
with COPD (or other chronic lung disease), and it looks like reactivation TB. So you
have an upper lobe cavitary lesion with adjacent nodules (suggesting endobronchial
spread).

Bronchiectatic ("Non-Classic") -   Lady Windermere - MAC
This is the so-called "Lady        -Bronchiectasis with tree-in-bud funl<
Windermere" disease (everyone      in the right middle iobe and iinguia
knows it's ju st not lady-hke to
cough). They often do not cough,
and are asymptomatic. This
favors an old white lady. You see
tree-in-bud opacities and
cylindric bronchiectasis in the
right middle lobe and lingula.

HIV Patients - You see this with low CD4s (< 100). The idea is that it's a GI infection
disseminated in the blood. You get a big spleen and liver. It frequently is mixed with
other pulmonary infections (PCP, etc...) given the low CD4 - so the lungs can look like
anything. M ediastinal lymphadenopathy is the m ost common manifestation.

Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis - This is the so-called "hot-tub lung." W here you get
aerosolized bugs (which exist in natural sea water and in fresh water). The lungs look
like ill-defined, ground glass centrilobular nodules.

interlobular lines are visible / thickened you might deploy the term
"crazy paving."

There are a variety of ways you can
throw infectious material into the
lungs via the bloodstream
(pulmonary arteries).

Some common sources would
include; infected tricupsid valves,
infection in the body, infected
catheters, infected te eth .. .e tc ...

Septic Emboli Trivia:
· It's lower lobe predom inant (more blood flow)
· You get peripheral nodular densities and wedge shaped densities (can infarct).
· They can cavitate, and likely will be cavitated if they show you a CT image.
· The feeding vessel sign - nodule with a big vessel going into it can be shown (also seen

     with hematogenous mets).
· Empyema and pneumothorax are both known complications.

Lemierre Syndrome:
This is an eponym referring to jugular vein throm bosis with septic em boli classically seen
after an oropharyngeal infection or recent ENT surgery.
