Gastric Band: Done for patients who have spent years steadily gorging on the

"neglected food groups" such as the whipped cream group, the congealed group,
and the chocolate group. This diet, combined with prolonged ass in a horizontal
position, has left them with no alternative but to undergo a surgical procedure.

The application of an inflatable silicone band around the upper part of the stomach
creates a restrictive pouch. This limits the amount of french fries and ice­
cream that can be eaten at one time. The goal of the procedure is to
inspire the patient to "stop eating" when they feel full - an unnatural
concept to certain populations (mostly southern West Virginia).

-Gastric Band Erosion and gastric leak can occur from pressure

of the stomach.

- Band Slippage (this is the most likely tested). The band should
be positioned around 2 o'clock (or have a phi angle between 4-58 ... it's
easier to just remember 5-50). If this angle is off (more flat) it infers the
band has slipped - which can lead to obstruction.

Afferent Loop Syndrome: A potential complication post billroth 2 (Roux-en-Y and also

Whipple / partial pancreaticoduodenectomy). The idea is that something extrinsic (adhesions, internal
hernia, neoplasm) or intrinsic (scarring from radiation, edema from a marginal ulcer) obstructs the
upstream / afferent limb causing secretions, bile, and pancreas juice to build up. The presentation is
typically belly pain often with bilious vomiting (depending on the level of obstruction). The imaging
is going to show a fluid filled "U-shaped" loop of bowel adjacent to the pancreas. If you are lucky
they will show the common bile duct entering the loop. If you are really lucky you will see the bile
ducts dilated. The pressure from all this back up dilates the gallbladder, and can cause pancreatitis.

Cancer: With regard to these old peptic ulcer surgeries (Billroths), there is a 3-6 times increased
risk of getting adenocarcinoma in the gastric remnant (like 15 years after the surgery).

Bile Reflux Gastritis: Fold thickening and filling defects seen in the stomach after Billroth I or
II are likely the result of bile acid reflux.

Jejunogastric Intussusception: This is a rare complication in which the jejunum herniates
back into the stomach (usually the efferent limb) and can cause gastric obstruction. High mortality is
present with the acute form.

the stomach and the jejunum                         near the gastrojejunal anastomosis

                                                    jejunal fold patterns.
The most common location is actually
just distal to the "G-J" anastomosis.

These things occur because the small
bowel is not used to getting exposed to
stomach acid - it don't like it.

They are typically solitary and
variable in size.

Gamesmanship: Marginal ulcers are classically solitary. If there are multiple giant (2.5 cm or larger)
ulcers in this same region - you could think more about chronic jejunal ischemia

- Upper Gl Surgeries - Part 3 - The Search for Small Bowel Obstruction -

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a potential problem for really anyone who has had abdominal
surgery and Roux-en-Y is certainly not immune with the potential for adhesions, internal hernia,
anterior body wall hernias, and strictures. Before I get into the nuts and bolts of these patterns I want
to discuss some basic principals o f obstruction.

It is important to understand that there are two main types o f true mechanical obstruction;
(I) simple and (2) closed loop. The causes are different. The outcomes are different. The treatments
are different. They are different - and you need to be able to distinguish between them (in real life,
and on multiple choice).

Simple M echanical: This is a scenario where you have a bowel loop that is obstructed at one point.
Let us take a look at the typical pathophysiology.

                                           279
Now, let us contrast simple mechanical obstruction with the more serious problem of a closed loop
obstruction. Closed loops have higher rates of ischemia and are typically treated surgically.

Closed Loop: Closed loop obstructions are defined by the presence of two (or more) points of
obstruction. Let us take a look at the typical pathophysiology

Now let us pivot back to the discussion o f obstruction in the setting o f Roux-en-Y surgery.
There are three primary types o f SBO described after Roux-en-Y based on their location.

Obstruction of the Alimentary   Obstruction of the               Obstruction Below the J-J
          (Roux Limb)          Biliopancreatic Limb

                               This is a closed loop and high
                               risk for ischemia / perforation.

                               It is closed loop because the
                               stomach is sewed shut
                               proximally (so both ends are
                               closed).

Dilated: Gastric pouch and     Dilated: Stomach and              : Depending on severity -

Adhesions are the most comm on cause o f SBO in Roux-en-Y -- assuming it was an open
surgical procedure. Laparoscopic procedures are different. Laparoscopic procedures create
less adhesions and allow for more mobility. M obility is bad. M obility lets things twist and
slide through defects (closed loop obstructions).

Another factor that promotes closed loop obstruction is the degree o f weight loss.
More weight loss = less protective, space occupying mesenteric fat stops shit from twisting.

There be whales here. A lso... internal hernias.

Ante-Colic vs Retro-Colic -- this terminology describes the passage of the Roux-Limb as either
in front o f (Ante) or behind (Retro) the transverse colon. If the surgeon chose to perform the
Retro-Colic subtype he/she would need to create a small defect in the transverse mesocolon to
pull the Roux limb up before connecting it to the excluded stomach. This defect will be a
potential source of internal hernia.
