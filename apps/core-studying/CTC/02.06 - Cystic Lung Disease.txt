(LIP): This is a benign lymphoproliferative

disorder, with infiUration of the lungs. It has an
association with autoimmune diseases (SLE, RA,
Sjogrens). The big one to know is Sjogrens
which is concomitant in 25% of LIP cases. The
other one to know is HIV - which is the LIP in a
younger patient (children, - LIP in H IVpositive
adults is rare). There is also an association with
Castlemans. The appearance of LIP varies
depending on the underlying cause. The cystic
lung disease is usually thin walled, "deep within
the lung parenchyma," and seen predominantly
with Sjogrens. The dominant feature described as
ground glass or nodules is seen more in the other
causes and is far beyond the scope of the exam.

 Centrilobular: By far the most
   common type. Common in
   asymptomatic elderly patients. It has
   an apical to basal gradient - favoring
   the upper zones of each lobe. It
   appears as focal lucencies, located
   centrally within the secondary
   pulmonary lobule, often with a
   central dot representing the central
   bronchovascular bundle.

This central dot sign (the vessel
within the secondary pulmonary lobule
is a buzzword.

This is the type of emphysema
dominant in smokers.

Panlobular: In contradistinction to centrilobular         Lower Lobes / Diffuse
this one favors the lower lobes. It also has a more
uniform distribution across parts o f the secondary       -Alpha 1 Anti-trypsin Def

appearance ("Ritalin keeps you from `trypsn' o u f ')-

to demonstrate the lower lobe predominance.
Patient's will present in their 60s and 70s (unless they
smoke - then they present in their 30s). Smoking
accelerates the process.

Paraseptal: This one is found adjacent to the pleura              Sub-pleural
and septal lines with a peripheral distribution within the        -Smoking vs Idiopathic
secondary pulmonary lobule. The affected lung is almost
always sub-pleural, and demonstrates small focal lucencies
up to 10 m m in size. This looks hke honeycom bing but is
