QUESTION ON ORAL BOARDS. NOW THAT SIMPLE QUESTION BECOMES NEARLY
IMPOSSIBLE TO FORMAT INTO A MULTIPLE CHOICE TEST. INSTEAD, THE FOCUS FOR
TRAINING FOR SUCH A TEST SHOULD BE ON THINGS THAT CAN BE ASKED. FOR
EXAMPLE, ANATOMY FACTS - WHAT IS IT? ... O R ... TRIVIA FACTS - WHAT IS THE MOST
COMMON LOCATION, OR AGE, OR ASSOCIATION, OR SYNDROME? ... O R ... W H A T 'S THE
NEXT STEP IN MANAGEMENT? TH IN K BACK TO MEDICAL SCHOOL U SM L E STYLE, THAT
IS WHAT YOU ARE DEALING WITH ONCE AGAIN. IN THIS BOOK, THE AU TH O R TRIED TO
COVER ALL THE MATERIAL THAT COULD BE ASKED (REASONABLY), AND THEN
APPROXIMATE HOW QUESTIONS MIGHT BE ASKED ABOUT THE VARIOUS TOPICS.

          Radiology M aster of Sport - National Champion

               Americans love to fight. Americans love the champion.

This right here is about recognizing a commitment to being the best. Being the best, standing on the
top stand - and more importantly the quest to stand on the top stand and wear the yellow medal is
what I want to recognize.

The quest is very lonely. They say it is lonely at the top - that is not true. I know that on my quest, I
didn't have any friends on the way there - nobody was getting up at 4am with m e... nobody, not one
person. It was just me - alone. It is lonely getting to the top and that is where most people fall off.
It's Friday and everyone else is going out, or there is a party or whatever - I'm tired and I want to
sleep in. I was on call last night- it is just not worth it. For me that is not what life is. Life is about
being the best person you can be in whatever it is you are doing. That does not have to be Radiology,
but because you are reading this book w'ell that is what it means for you now.

You make the quest. If you get the top score on the exam - I'll be putting your name in this book next
year and you can motivate the next legend of tomorrow'. Plus, I'll give you some money and have an
enormous lion trophy made for you.

The most important thing is not actually winning. People think I only care about winning because I
rant and rave about how only the gold medal count - but the quest is what I really value. I'm not
training for silver. I'm training for gold. The quest for gold is more important than someone handing
you a gold medal. The katana sword of the black dragon society cannot be stolen - it can only be
earned. Outcomes really don't matter, because the truth is in this life you can do eveiything 100%
perfect and still fail and you can do almost everything wrong and still win. If you don't focus on
outcomes and instead the quest itself you will get something much greater -- besides a high
probability of passing the test - what you can gain from the quest, the ability to really dedicate
yourself to something 100% - it is a skill you can use for the rest of your life. This is the way to
always achieve victory. Once you know the way, you can see it in all things - as the samurai say.
