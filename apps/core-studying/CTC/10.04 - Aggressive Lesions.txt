There are tons of primary osseous malignancies, the most common are myeloma/plasmacytoma (27%),
Osteosarcoma (20%) and Chondrosarcoma (20%). I'll discuss myeloma/plasmacytoma later in the chapter
when I get to lucent lesions. This discussion will focus more on the bone forming aggressive tumors.
I guess before I do that though, I should review what "aggressive" means. In the real world, dealing with
bone lesions is simple - it's either aggressive, not aggressive, or not sure. Even though muhiple choice is
very different than actual clinical radiology, that first mental calculus of - aggressive not aggressive -
may still be useful in eliminating distractors.

What makes a lesion "aggressive " ?

According to Helms, the wide zone of transition is the      Narrow Zone -          Wide Zone -
best sign that a lesion is aggressive. This is actually a        Benign             Aggressive
useful pearl. The simplest way to conceptualize this is
to ask yourself if you can trace the edges of the lesion
with a pencil. If you can the lesion is probably benign.
If the edges are blurry or there is a gradient to the edge
- this is a more likely an aggressive lesions.

The reason is that margins reflect the growth the lesion. Bones are dumb. They really only know how to
do two things - make bone and destroy bone. The margins are the reflection of bone formation. If the
margins are sharp and sclerotic, this means the bone has time to adjust to the irritation and lay down a
coat of mature bone. If the margins are not distinct (zone of transition is wide) this indicates a faster
growing lesion and therefore a higher probability of malignancy (or infection).

If the tumor grows rapidly enough it can break through the cortex and destroy the
newly formed bone capsule / lamellated bone. When this happens you end up with
a triangular structure - called the Codman triangle (as shown in diagram).

When we think about bone lesions, we often imagine lytic holes or bone destruction. Bone destruction
occurs from complex methods best understood as either direct obliteration via the tumor or pissed off
osteoclasts enraged by the uninvited tumor / hyperemia. Trabecular bone loss occurs more rapidly
(relative to cortical bone), but is noticed later because cortical bone is more smooth and organized.
Supposedly you need to destroy 70% of the trabecular bone before it is noticed radiographically.

Bone destruction that occurs in a uniform geographic pattern        Geographic  Moth   Permeative
(especially with a sharp well defined border) is more suggestive                Eaten
of a benign slow growing lesion. A moth-eaten (cluster of small
lytic holes) or permeative (ill-defined tiny oval or streak like
lucencies) suggests rapid infiltrative tumor growth -- as seen in
myeloma, lymphoma, and Ewings sarcoma. It is worth noting
that osteomyelitis and hyperparathyroidism can also demonstrate
these aggressive patterns - pre-test probably is always important.

                             OSTEOSARCOMA (OS)

There are a bunch of subtypes, but for the purpose of this discussion there are 4. Conventional
Intramedullary (85%), Parosteal (4%), Periosteal (1%), Telangiectatic (rare). All the subtypes
produce bone or osteoid from neoplastic cells. Most are idiopathic but you can have secondary
causes {usually seen in elderly) XRT, Pagets, Infarcts, etc...

Conventional Intramedullary: More common, and higher grade than the surface subtypes
(periosteal, and parosteal). Primary subtypes typically occur in young patients (10-20). The most
common location is the femur (40®/o), and proximal tibia (15%).

            Buzzwords include various types of aggressive periosteal reactions:

                                    Progress Over Time

                                    "Reverse Zoning" = Bad

        "Sunburst"                    "Reverse Zoning Phenomenon"              "Lamellated"
Periosteal reaction that is         Denser mature matrix in the center,    (onion skin reaction)
aggressive and looks like a         less peripherally (opposite of       Multi layers of parallel
sunburst-                           myositis ossificans).                periosteum, looks like
                                                                         an onion's skin.

                                    "Codman Triangle"

                                    With aggressive lesions, the periosteum does not have time
                                    to ossify completely with new bone (e.g. as seen in single
                                    layer and multi-layered periosteal reaction), so only the
                                    edge of the raised periosteum will ossify - creating the
                                    appearance o f a triangle.

Trivia: Osteosarcoma met to the lung is a "classic" cause of occult pneumothorax.

Skip Lesions/Mets: Synchronous tumor in the same bone or the immediate opposing side of a
joint - separated by normal marrow. They are usually proximal to the main tumor and occur
around 5% o f the time in OS. This is the reason you image the ENTIRE bone during staging.

Think B ig ... just say Big. This guy loves the posterior distal femur {because o f this location
it can mimic a cortical desm oid "tug lesion " early on). The lesion is metaphyseal 90% o f the
time. The buzzword is ''string sign'' - which refers to a radiolucent line separating the bulky
tumor from the cortex.
