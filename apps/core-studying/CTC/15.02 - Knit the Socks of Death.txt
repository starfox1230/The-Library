                     Problem Solving Through MRi

Different programs have variable volume with MRI. Some of you will be excellent at it.
Some of you will suck at it. An important skill to have is to understand how to problem solve
with different sequences. The best way to do this is to have a list of T1 bright things, T2
bright things, dark things, and things that restrict diffusion.

Be able to move through sequences and problem solve.

Think about a Lipoma for example. This will be T1 bright, T2 bright, and fat sat out.
Another example might be something with layers in it. What can layer? Fat could layer,
water could layer, blood could layer, pus could layer. Fat would be bright/ bright. Water
would be dark on Tl. Pus would be dark on T2. Blood could do different things depending
on it's age. Fat would sat out. Pus may restrict diffusion (like a subdural empyema). You get
the idea. Run through some scenarios in your mind. The key point is to know your
differentials for this.

THIS vs THAT:Meconium Aspiration or Non Group B Strep Pneumonia

This is super tough without any history, and because of that Ifeel like the test writer has
two options: (1) Stop being an asshole and give you some history, (2) not include both as
answer choices - assuming only one is correct. Now, along those lines if you saw both as
choices and the question header gives you no history you could eliminate them both as
distractors - because they both can't be correct.

                                 possible choice. The question header can help
                                 you disqualify (as we discussed with cyanotic
                                 heart disease) or you can try and find choices that
                                 cannot be distinguished from each other. Both
                                 answers c a n 't be right - so they must both be

Prematurity -- Guessing that the kid is premature can be helpful for eliminating

choices (Meconium Aspiration is more of a post term thing), and raising your pretest
probability (SDD, or NEC in a belly film). There are two main clues:

(1) Humeral Head Ossification - This tends to occur closer to term. If the humeral
     head is NOT ossified you can assume (in the world of multiple choice) that the kid
     is likely premature.

(2) Lack o f Subcutaneous Fat - Premature kids tend to be very skinny, although I think
     of this more of a soft sign that is useful when absent more than present. I 'll just
     say that if the kid appears chubby he is probably NOT premature.

The N G tube curling into the chest --it's either (1)  NG Tube Curls in the upper thoracic
in the lung, or (2 ) it's in a congenital              esophagus. First think Esophageal
diaphragmatic hernia. If I had to pick between the     Atresia. Then think VACTERL
two (and it w asn't obvious), I 'd say left side
hernia, right side lung - just because those are the
more common sides.

The Classic Congenital Lobar Em physema Trick: They can show you a
series o f CXRs. The first one has an opacity in the lung (the affected lung is fluid filled). The
next x-ray will show the opacity resolved. The following x-ray will show it getting more
lucent, and more lucent. Until it's actually pushing the heart over. This is the classic w ay to
show it in case conference, or case books

T h e School A ged CXR: Things to look for:

    · Big Heart - Probably showing you a sickle cell case. Look for bone infarcts in shoulders.
     · Lucent Lung - Think foreign Body (air trapping). Remember you put the affected side

          down (if it remains lucent- that confirms it).

T h e M andible: There are only a few things that a mandible will be shown for with
regards to Peds. Think Caffeys first - especially if the picture looks blurry and old (there
hasn't been a case o f this in 50 years). I f it's osteonecrosis think about O.I. on
bisphosphonates. If it's a dw arf case, think wide angled m andible with Pyknodysostosis. A
"floating tooth" could be EG.

                · Bulging the liver,
                · Presence o f a central scar, or
                · Classic spoke wheel appearance on doppler.

                - A thin peripheral halo of hypoechogenicity can
                   represent either focal fatty sparing (in the case of
                   an Adenoma) or... a fibrous capsule (target) as is
                   often seen in HCC - so this should also be
