Anatomy: The pancreas is a retroperitoneal structure (the tail may be intraperitoneal).

Cystic Fibrosis: The pancreas is involved in 85-90% o f CF patients. Inspissated
secretions cause proximal duct obstruction leading to the two main changes in C F:
(1) Fibrosis (decreased T1 and T2 signal)
(2) Fatty replacement (increased T l) - the more common o f the two

Patients with CF, who are diagnosed as adults, tend to have more pancreas problems than
those diagnosed as children. Just remember that those with residual pancreatic exocrine
function tend to have bouts o f recurrent acute pancreatitis (they keep getting clogged up with
thick secretions). Small (1-3 mm) pancreatic cysts are common.

High Yield Trivia:
· Complete fa tty replacem ent is the most

  common imaging finding in adult CF
· Markedly enlarged with fatty replacement

  has been termed lipomatous
  pseudohypertrophy of the pancreas.

Dorsal Pancreatic Agenesis: - All you need to know is that (1) this sets you up for
diabetes (most o f yo u r beta cells are in the tail), and (2) it's associated with polysplenia.

Annular Pancreas: Essentially an em bryologic screw up (failure o f ventral bud to
rotate with the duodenum), that results in encasement o f the duodenum. Results in a rare
cause o f duodenal obstruction (10%), that typically presents as duodenal obstruction in
children and pancreatitis in adults. Can also be associated with other vague symptoms (post­
prandial fullness, "symptoms of peptic ulcer disease", etc...).

· Remember in adults this can present with pancreatitis (the ones that present earlier - in
     kids - are the ones that obstruct).

· On imaging, look for an annular duct encircling the descending duodenum.

Pancreatic Trauma: The pancreas sits in front o f the vertebral body, so it's susceptible
to getting smashed in blunt trauma. Basically, the only thing that matters is integrity of
the duct. If the duct is damaged, they need to go to the OR. The m ost com m on delayed
comphcation is pancreatic fistula (10-20%), followed by abscess formation. Signs o f injury
can be subtle, and may include focal pancreatic enlargement or adjacent stranding/fluid.

Imaging Pearls:
· Remember it can be subtle with just focal enlargement o f the pancreas
· If you see low attenuation fluid separating two portions o f the enhancing pancreatic

  parenchyma this is a laceration, NOT contusion.
· The presence o f fluid surrounding the pancreas is not specific, it could be from injury or

  just aggressive hydration -- on the test they will have to show you the liver and IVC to
   prove it's aggressive fluid resuscitation.

- Pancreatitis -

Acute Pancreatitis:

Etiology: By far the most common causes are gallstones and EtOH which combined make
up 80% o f the cases in the real world. However, for the purpose of multiple choice tests, a
bite from the native scorpion o f the island o f Trinidad and Tobago is more likely to be the
etiology. Additional causes include ERCP {which usually results in a m ild course),
medications {classically valproic acid), trauma {the most common cause in a child),
pancreatic cancer, infectious {post viral in children), hypercalcem ia, hyperlipidem ia,
autoimmune pancreatitis, pancreatic divisum, groove (para-duodenal) pancreatitis, tropic
pancreatitis, and parasite induced.

Clinical Outcomes: Prognosis can be estimated with the "Balthazar Score." Essentially, you
can think about pancreatitis as "mild" (no necrosis) or "severe" (having necrosis). Patients
with necrosis don't start doing terrible until they get infected, then the m ortality is like
50-70%.

Key Point: Outcomes are directly correlated with the degree o f pancreatic necrosis.

          compared to the liver (opposite o f normal).

          - Pancreatic Divisum -

Anatomy Refresher: There are two ducts, a major (Wirsung), and a minor (Santorini). Under
"normal" conditions the major duct will drain in the inferior of the two duodenal papilla
(major papilla). The minor duct will drain into the superior of the two duodenal papilla
(minor papilla). The way I remember this is that "Santorini drains Superior", and "Santorini is
Small," i.e. the minor duct.

Pancreatic Divisum is the most common     Nornnal (85%)      Divisum (~15%)
anatomic variant of the human pancreas,
and occurs when the main portion of the  -Bifid System with
pancreas is drained by the minor or
accessory papilla. The clinical
relevance is an increased risk of
pancreatitis.

                         - Chronic Pancreatitis -

CP represents the end result of prolonged inflammatory change leading to irreversible
fibrosis o f the gland. Acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis are thought o f as different
disease processes, and most cases o f acute pancreatitis do not result in chronic disease. So,
acute doesn't have to lead to chronic (and usually doesn't), but chronic can still have
recurrent acute.

Etiology: Same as acute pancreatitis, the most common causes are chronic alcohol abuse
and cholelithiasis which together result in about 90% of the cases. (EtOH is #1)

Imaging Findings: Findings can be thought o f as early or late:

Earlv:

· Loss o f T1 signal (pancreas is normally the brightest T1 structure in the body)

· Delayed Enhancement

· Dilated Side Branches                    ~

Late:
· Commonly small, uniformly atrophic

  - but can have focal enlargement
· Pseudocyst formation (30%)
· Dilation and beading of the pancreatic

  duct with calcifications
  * * most characteristic finding o f CP.

                                           (obstructive atrophy)

Complications: Pancreatic cancer (20 years o f CP = 6% risk o f Cancer) is the m ost crucial
complication in CP and is the biggest diagnostic challenge because focal enlargement o f the
gland induced by a fibrotic inflammatory pseudotumor may be indistinguishable from
pancreatic carcinoma.

                     - Cystic Pancreatic lesions -

Pseudocyst: W hen you see a cystic lesion in the pancreas, by far the most common cause
is going to be an inflammatory pseudocyst, either from acute pancreatitis or chronic
pancreatitis.

Simple Cysts: True epithelial lined cysts are rare, and tend to occur with syndromes such
as VHL, Polycystic Kidney Disease, and Cystic Fibrosis.

Serous Cystadenom a fGrandmaJ.- The form er term "m icrocystic adenom a" helps
me think o f a little old lady, which is appropriate for a lesion prim arily found in elderly
ladies. The lesion is benign, and classically described as a heterogeneous, mixed-density
lesion made up o f multiple small cysts, which resembles a sponge. They are more commonly
(70%) located in the pancreatic head (mucinous is almost always in the body or tail). An
additional key distinction is that it does NOT communicate with the pancreatic duct (IPMNs
do). About 20% o f the time they will have the classic central scar, with or without central
calcifications {mucinous calcifications are peripheral).

Rarely, they can be unilocular. W hen you see a unilocular cyst with a lobulated contour
located in the head o f the pancreas, you should think about this more rare unilocular
macrocystic serous cystadenoma subtype.

Trivia: Serous Cystadenoma is associated with Von Hippel Lindau

Mucinous C y stic Neoplasm (IVlotherJ.- This pre-m ahgnant lesion is "always" found
in women, usually in their 50s. All are considered pre-malignant and need to come out. They
are found in the body and tail {serous was more common in the head). There is generally no
communication with the pancreatic duct {IPMNs will communicate). Peripheral calcifications
are seen in about 25% of cases {serous was more central). They are typically unilocular.
W hen multilocular, individual cystic spaces tend to be larger than 2 cm in diameter {serous
spaces are typically smaller than 2 cm).

Memory Aid: "MUCINOUS in the MOTHER"

Solid Pseudopapillary Tumor of the Pancreas - (Daughter^; Very rare, low
grade malignant tumor that occurs almost exclusively in young (30s) females (usually Asian
or Black). It is typically large at presentation, has a predilection for the tail, and has a "thick
capsule." Similar to a hemangioma it may demonstrate progressive fill-in of the solid
portions.

                  - Solid Pancreatic Lesions -

Pancreatic Cancer basically comes in two flavors. (1) Ductal Adenocarcinoma - which is
hypovascular and (2) Islet Cell / Neuroendocrine which is hypervascular.

Ductal Adenocarcinoma: In the setting of a multiple choice                  Peak Parenchyma
                                                                               Enhancement
test, the finding of an enlarged gallbladder with painless jaundice is
highly suspicious for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, especially when          Pancreas = 40 Seconds
combined with migratory thrombophlebitis {Trousseau's syndrome).            Liver = 60 Seconds
The peak incidence is in the 7* or 8* decade. The strongest risk
factor is smoking.

Two-thirds of these cancers arise from the pancreatic head. On ultrasound or MRCP, obstruction of
both the common bile duct and the pancreatic duct is referred to as the "double duct sign". On CT, the
findings are typically a hypo-enhancing mass which is poorly demarcated and low attenuation
compared to the more brightly enhancing background parenchyma. The optimal timing is on a
pancreatic phase (40 seconds). MRI will show a low T1 signal mass (normal pancreas is T1 bright).

-Ductal Dilation  -Ductal Dilation                                      -Ductal Dilation
                  -Hypo-enhancing Mass                                  -Mass now iso-intense

The key to staging is assessment of the SMA and celiac axis, which if involved make the patient's
cancer unresectable. Involvement of the GDA is ok, because it comes out with the Whipple.

Additional Trivia Points about Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma:
· Tumor Marker = CA 19-9
· Hereditary Syndromes with Pancreatic CA:

  · HNPCC, BRCA Mutation, Ataxia-Telangiectasia, Peutz-Jeghers
· Small Bowel Follow Through: Reverse impression on the duodenum "Frostburg's Inverted 3 Sign"

  or a "Wide Duodenal Sweep." They would have to actuallyfin d a case o f the inverted 3 to show it,
  but could ask it in words. The "Wide Duodenal Sweep " could actually be shown.

Periampullary Tumor: Defined as originating within 2cm of                 Within 2cm of the Major Papilla
the major papilla. These can be cancers of the distal common bile
duct, pancreas, or duodenum. It can be difficult to differentiate from a
conventional pancreatic adenocarcinoma as both can obstruct the bile
duct, and present as a mass in the region of the pancreatic head.
MRCP/MRI is the exam of choice to try and get a good look at this
region. They can try and treat them with a Whipple and in general
they have a better prognosis than pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Trivia: There is an increased incidence of ampullary carcinoma in
Gardner's Syndrome.

Islet Cell /Neuroendocrine:                  Hyper-Enhancing Tumor
Neuroendocrine tumors are uncommon
tumors o f the pancreas. Typically
hypervascular, with brisk enhancement
during arterial or pancreatic phase. They
can be thought o f as non-functional or
functional, and then subsequently further
divided based on the hormone they make.
They can be associated with both MEN 1
and Von Hippel Lindau.

Insulinoma: The most common type (about 75%). They are almost always benign (90%),
solitary, and small (< 2cm).

Gastrinoma: The second most common                 - Gastrinoma Triangle -
type overall, but most common type
associated with M EN 1. They are m alignant  The anatomical region where most (90%) of
like 30-60%. They can cause increased        gastrinomas arise.

                                               the cystic and
Non-Functional: The most common                 common bile

                               Intrapancreatic Accessory Spleen

It is possible to have a pancreatic mass that is actually just a piece of spleen. The typical
scenario is that of post traumatic splenosis. Look for the question stem to say something like
"history o f trauma. " Another hint may be the absence of a normal spleen.
Imaging Findings:
-Follows spleen on all image sequences (dark on T l, and bright on T2 - relative to the liver).
-It will restrict diffusion (just like the spleen).
-The classic give away, and most likely way it will be shown is as a tiger striped mass on arterial
phase (tiger striped like the spleen on arterial phase).

Trivia: Nuclear medicine tests - (1) Heat Treated RBCs, and (2) Sulfur Colloid can be used to
prove the mass is spleen (they both take up tracer -- just like a spleen).
