The exact appearance of the striated nephrogram stripes is a common source of trivia. In the setting
of acute pyelonephritis, the areas of reduced enhancement (stripes) classically involve a complete wedge
of renal parenchyma, extending from medulla peripherally all the wav to the capsule.

                                    enhancement is called the "cortical
                                    rim sign" and helps you distinguish
                                    between infarct and infection (on
                                    multiple choice exams). In the real
                                    world the cortical rim is seen maybe
                                    50% of the time with infarcts.

( Pyonephrosis ) Pyelonephritis with Obstruction:                                  Next Step:
Pyelonephritis is classically associated with stones, but remember the actual       Urgent
cause is a retrograde infection. Having said that, if infection is present in the
setting of obstruction (for example secondary to a stone) this becomes an             Decom pression

Abscess - Pyelo may be complicated by abscess, which can present on
CT as round or geographic low attenuation collections that do not enhance
centrally, but do have an enhancing rim. Bigger than 3cm and these guys
might visit the IR section for drainage.

Chronic Pyelonephritis - Sort of a controversial entity. It is not clear whether the condition is
an active chronic infection, arises from multiple recurrent infections, or represents stable changes from
a remote single infection. The imaging findings are characterized by renal scarring, atrophy and
cortical thinning, with hj^ertrophy of residual normal tissue. Basically, you have a small deformed
kidney, with a bunch of wedge defects, and some hypertrophied areas.

Chronic destructive granulomatous process that
is basically always seen with a staghom stone
acting as a nidus for recurrent infection. You
can have an associated psoas abscess with
minimal perirenal infection. It's an Aunt
Minnie, with a very characteristic "Bear Paw"
appearance on CT. The kidney is not
functional, and sometimes nephrectomy is done
to treat it.

HIV Nephropathy- This is the most common cause of renal impairment in AIDS (CD4 < 200)
patients. Although the kidneys can be normal in size, they are classically enlarged, and bright
(echogenic). Some sources will go as far as saying that normal echotexture excludes the disease (this
entity is essentially always bright). Loss of the renal sinus fat appearance has also been described (it's
edema in the fat, rather than loss of the actual fat).

Just think - BIG and BRIGHT kidney in HIV positive patient who is clinically in nephrotic
syndrome (massive proteinuria).

A Gamesmanship: To show you the kidney is big (longer than 12 cm) they will have to put
          calibers on the kidney. Calibers on anything should be a clue that the size being displayed is
          relevant.

Final diagnosis is going to be via biopsy of the big bright kidney.

Disseminated PCP in HIV patients can result in punctate (primarily cortical) calcifications.

TB- The most common extra-pulmonary site of infection is

the urinary tract. TB in the kidneys is similar to TB in the
lungs with prolonged latency (years after exposure) and
"reactivation." You could be shown imaging findings that
occur along a spectrum of severity. For the purpose of
multiple choice strategy the more severe disease would lend
itself better to imaging, and the less severe findings would
be more likely to be asked as trivia questions.

Calyceal blunting ("moth eaten calices") is the earliest              Normal IVP (from 1960)
finding. Remember the normal calyx should have a "gentle              -Cup Shaped Calyces
cup shape" -- not all pointy and shit.                                -Symmetry of the Renal Pelvis

Distortion o f the calyx / papillary necrosis will result in
deep cups, and "w" shaped central necrosis patterns.
This is nonspecific - ischemia, diabetes, lots of things can do this
- but it is the "earliest described sign" which makes it testable.

Renal calcifications, which are very common with TB, can be
punctate, curvilinear, or replace the entire kidney. This
extensive calcification is a classic (and very testable) look for
TB - called the "Putty Kidney" - or an autonephrectomized end
stage TB kidney.

Another nonspecific finding - that can help you zero in on the
choice of TB is the presence of multiple calcified mesenteric
lymph nodes -- arrows in my cartoon. Calcified adrenal glands
could also be seen.

                         Contrast Induced Nephropathy (CIN)
                                          An Infectious Propaganda

The more you read about this the more you reahze it's probably com plete (or at least
near complete) bullshit. Unfortunately a number of academics (mostly nephrologists)
have made a career on this and can be pretty defensive when the subject is brought into
question. For example, just the other day I had the following interaction with one such
member o f the nephrology community.

Nephrologist: Hey! Do you believe in the plague o f Contrast Induced Nephropathy ?

Prometheus: I don't know. There seems to be some controversy in the hterature...

Nephrologist: D on't jerk me around ! It's a simple question! A baby could answer it!

Prometheus: I guess so...

Nephrologist: Oh, you made a wise choice, my friend! If you had said no, I would have
bitten your ear o f f ! I would have come at you like a tornado made o f arms and teeth.
And - and fingernails.

For the Exam -- Trivia to know:
 Allergic reactions are NOT considered a risk factor for CIN.
 "Risk Factors" for CIN include pre-existing renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus (even

  more so with pre-existing renal insufficiency), cardiovascular disease with CHF,
  dehydration, and myeloma.
 Hydration via IV with 0.9% normal saline 6-12 hours before and continuing 4-12
  hours after contrast administration supposedly decreases the incidence o f CIN in
  patients with chronic renal insufficiency (true m echanism is diluting Cr levels).
  Oral hydration has been shown to not work as well.
