Renal transplant is the best treatment for end stage renal disease, and the quality o f life is
significantly better than that o f a long term dialysis patient (which fucking sucks !!!). The
transplanted kidney is most commonly placed in the extraperitoneal iliac fossa so that the
allograft can be anastomosed with the iliac vasculature and urinary bladder.

The way they do this surgery depends on where the kidney comes from (living vs cadaveric). The
main thing to know is that a kidney "harvested" from a hobo found floating in the river will have
not only the kidney and renal artery removed but also a segment of the aorta - that can be used for
end-to-side anastomosis to the recipient external iliac artery. In a living donation they aren't gonna
carve on the aorta (cuz you need your aorta to live). In both cases, end to side anastomosis is
preferred for the vein and artery - typically to the external iliac vein and artery (although you can
see the internal iliac used in some situations).

Normal: The superficial location o f the transplant in the iliac fossa makes ultrasound the
modality o f choice for evaluation. A transplant kidney is just like a native kidney. It should
have low resistance (it's always "on"). The upstroke should be brisk, and the flow in diastole
forward (remember it's always "on").

- Understanding Renal RIs -

There are two major points to know first when thinking about RIs. The first is the kidney has

a capsule, and that capsule is unforgiving (it believes in nothing Lebowski). The second is a

sick kidney is a swollen kidney.

Now lets look at this formula:    Rl =  Peak Systolic - End Diastolic "lowest diastolic"
                                                                Peak Systolic

If the meat (parenchyma) o f the kidney is sick and     Ri =  Peak SV - End DV   = RI
swollen, but can't expand because it is wrapped in a                        PSV
tight unforgiving capsule you can imagine the
blood vessels going through that kidney are going
to get the squeeze.

You can also probably imagine that the passive          Low Resistance -
diastolic flow would be more impaired (compared
to the active systolic flow) by this squeeze.

If the meat of the kidney becomes "sick" from           High Resistance
whatever the cause might be {rejection, infection,      *decreased
inflammation, etc...) it swells increasing resistance.  diastolic flow

R I's should stay below 0.7. The higher the RI the sicker the kidney. This is why RIs are useful,
and this is why an upward trend in RI is worrisome. It is important to remember, RIs are not
specific since elevation occurs with basically every pathology. For the purpose of multiple
choice, you should never use elevated RIs to exclude answers (unless the answer is normal).
Elevation in RIs does tell you something is wrong, especially if there is an upward trend.

         The 3 Flavors of Complications - (a) Urologic, (Id Vascular (cl Cancer

- Urologic Complications - (more common than vascular complications)

Obstruction - The ureter must also be surgically implanted (ureteral neocystostomy to the bladder
dome). Just like in a native kidney the ureter can get obstructed. Don't be fooled by the ultimate asshole trick of
showing you mild hydro on a transplant (especially one with normal labs) and trying to get you to call obstruction.
Transplanted kidneys pretty much all have some mild hydro - this is related to denervation of the transplant, and
floppy tone to the ureter. If there is a true obstruction it is usually at the site of ureteral implantation to the bladder.
The common causes are post operative edema, scarring, or technical errors leading to kinking. Stones, clots, etc.. are
less common. Having said that - transplants are more likely to have stones compared to the general population - it is
just that other stuff (edema, scar, k in k , etc... is more common).

Hematoma - Common immediately post op. Usually resolves spontaneously. Large hematoma can produce
hydro. Acute hematoma will be echogenic, and this will progressively become less echogenic (with older
hematomas more anechoic and septated).

Urinoma - This is usually found in the first 2 weeks post op. Urine leak or urinoma will appear as an
anechoic fluid collection with no septations, that is rapidly increasing in size. Most leaks (urine extravasation)
are going to be at the ureterovesical anastomosis. MAG 3 nuclear medicine scan can be used to demonstrate
this (or the cheaper ultrasound).

Lymphocele - Lymphoceles typically occur 1-2 months after transplant. They are caused by leakage of
lymph from surgical disruption of lymphatics or leaking lymphatics in the setting of inflammation. The fluid
collection is usually medial to the transplant (between the graft and the bladder). They are actually the most
common fluid collection to cause transplant hydronephrosis.

- Urologic Complications Continued (more common than vascular complications)

Rejection is complicated business with a bunch of fancy sounding French words (maybe Latin) associated
with numerous overlapping biopsy related classification criteria and which subtype of the T-Cell mediated
pathway blah blah blah. None of that shit matters to Radiologists. Rejection workup involves, labs,
considering the time interval, ultrasound, maybe nukes, and in many cases a biopsy to actually prove it.

Hyperacute Rejection is an immediate failure of the graft - and you rarely see this imaged. It is
basically a dead on arrival transplant.

Acute Rejection is usually seen around week 1-3 (it is actually rare in the first 3 days). There is
overlap between the antibody mediated types (which occur early) and the T-cell activated types (which
occur later) - but again that shit is irrelevant to Radiologists. Up to 20% of transplant patients will have
some early rejection. The graft may swell and RIs will go up. Rejection vs ATN is the common question -
and MAG3 can help (see chart on the next page). Regardless of the Nukes Exam, most sources say
"biopsy" is the standard for differentiating the two.

Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN) is common and occurs to variable degrees on basically every
transplant. The mechanism is ischemia in the kidney after they carve it out of the Hobo (presuming the
transplant is from the usual donor - Hobo found floating in the river). So in the time it takes to carve it
out of the Hobo and sew it into an affluent celebrity (Selena Gomez, Tracy Morgan, etc..) there is going to
be some ischemia - and therefore ATN.

Lingo: "Delayed Graft Function (DGF) " = transplant requiring dialysis in the first week. The amount of
"cold ischemia" (how long the hobo kidney is on ice) is said to be the best predictor.

Cyclosporin Toxicity (Calcineurin Inhibitor) - Immunosuppressive therapy necessary to
keep the body from rejecting the graft can ironically end up poisoning the graft. The timing is usually
later than ATN (around a month). The MAG3 exam can also look like ATN (normal perfijsion, with
retained tracer) but will NOT be seen in the immediate post op period.

Chronic Rejection is a gradual progress process which occurs months to years after transplant. The
kidney may enlarge, and you can lose corticomedullary differentiation. The RIs will elevate (> 0.7),
which is nonspecific.

- Vascular Complications -

Renal Artery Thrombosis     always seen within the first month (usually minutes to

hours post odV resulting from technical factors - kinking or torsion of the vessel. Unless the patient

is undergoing rejection, or has renal artery stenosis (which has progressed to full on thrombosis) it is

pretty fucking rare to see this outside the early post-operative period. As a point of trivia - this is

different than hepatic artery transplant thrombosis -- which is described as a later complication (>

than 1 month post op) -- so don't get it twisted and let the bastards trick you.

Renal Artery Stenosis - Typically seen within the first year after transplant (usually weeks

to months). Easily the most common vascular complication of transplant. This usually occurs at
the anastomosis (especially end-to-end types). CMV is a risk factor. The clinical / scenario buzzword
is going to be "refractory hypertension." Criteria include:

      PSV > 200-300 cm/s. (some people say 340-400 cm/s)
      PSV ratio > 1.8-2.5x (Stenotic Part vs Non Stenotic Part)
      Tardus Parvus: Measured at the Main Renal Artery Hilum (NOT at the arcuates)
      Anastomotic Jetting

Renal Vein Thrombosis - Typically seen within the first week. Typically the kidney is
swollen. Instead of showing you the Doppler of the renal vein (which would show no flow), they will
most likely show you the artery, which classically has reversed diastolic flow.

                                                                                                        Reversed

 Renal Vein Thrombosis - with the artery showing reversal o f diastolic
 flow. Some people call this the "reverse M sign."

Arteriovenous Fistula (AVF) - These occur secondary to biopsy. They occur about 20% o f
the tim e post biopsy, but are usually sm all and asym ptom atic. They will likely show it w ith tissue
vibration artifact (perivascular, m osaic color assignm ent due to tissue vibration), w ith high arterial

velocity, and pulsatile flow in the vein.

Pseudoaneurysm - These also occur secondary to biopsy, but are less com m on. They can also

occur in the setting o f graft infection, or anastomotic dehiscence. They will most likely show you the
classic "yin-yang" color picture. Alternatively, they could show Doppler with biphasic flow at the
neck of the pseudoaneurysm.

-Cancer-

The prolonged immunosuppression therapy that renal transplant patients are on places them
at significantly (lOOx) increased risk o f developing some type o f cancer. In particular, they
get more nonmelanomatous skin cancer, lymphoma, and colon cancer. In fact - annual skin
exams are a recom m endation for all renal transplant patients -- that is kinda random .... and
possibly testable.

RCC - Increased risk, with most of the cancers (90%) actually occurring in the native
kidney. Etiology is not totally understood; m aybe it's the im m unosuppression or the fact that
many transplant patients were on dialysis (a known risk factor) that leads to the cancer risk.
In reality it doesn't matter, and is probably both.

Risk o f primary renal malignancy in the transplanted kidney is six times that o f the regular
Joe. A point o f testable trivia is that these cancers are usually papillary subtypes.

Post Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (PTLD) - This is an
uncommon com phcation o f organ transplant, associated with B-Cell prohferation. EBV is a
risk factor and that is one o f the main reasons they screen for it - and will put people on
Rituximab (if they mention that drug - they could be hinting that patient was EBV positive).

It is m ost com mon in the first year post transplant, and often involves multiple organs. The
most typical look is a mass lesion encasing / replacing the hilum - although the appearance is
notoriously variable. The treatment is to back off the immunosuppression.

Renal Transplant + BK Virus = Urothelial Malignancy

WTF is "B K Virus" ? It is some random virus that pretty much everyone gets and doesn't even
notice. Nephrologists love to write papers on this critter. S upposedly... (yes I read their stupid
papers) it is usually the donor kidney that has it and then it reactivates something crazy once the
patient is immunosuppressed. Sometimes it even m im ics rejection.

Just know BK = Urothelial Cancer.

Cyclophosphamide - As a point o f trivia, significant exposure to cyclophospham ide
(less common now with the development o f cyclosporin A) is associated with increased risk
of urothelial cancer.

 A Femoral Head AVN After Renal Transplant -- This used to be a classic MSK cross over
