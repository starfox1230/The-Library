Basics:

As I m entioned in the introduction,
a screening mammogram starts with
two standard views; a cranial caudal
(CC) view and a medial lateral
oblique (MLO) view.

                                                               M LO

Adequate Technique - MLO View:

Nipple                                                          If you look at both MLOs at once
should be in                                                    (mirror imaged) - the pectorals
profile (this                                                   should make a "V" or a "U"
is also true
on the CC        Pectoralis: The lower edge of the
view). You       pectoralis muscle must be at the level of
really must      posterior-nipple line (PNL) or below
have the
nipple in
profile in at
least one
view.

Adequate Technique - CC View:                                   Posterior Nipple Line (PNL):

 N ipple P oin tin g - be careful where you point that thing!  PNL on CC must be within 1 cm of
 Nipple must be in profile and pointing straight               the same measurement of the MLO
 (Sideways nipple pointing is unacceptable)                    view.

                                                               For example: if the MLO nipple line
                                                               measurement was 10 cm, the CC
                                                               nipple line must be at least 9 cm.

Positioning Trivia:

When do you get a LMO view ? The MLO is the standard, but sometimes you need a LMO. The
answer is women with kyphosis, pectus excavatum, or to avoid a medial pacemaker / central line.

MLO View Trivia: The MLO view contains the most breast tissue of all the possible views

When using Spot Compression Views: A big point is the recommendation to leave the collimator
open, giving you a larger field of view. Small paddles give you better focal compression. Large
paddles allow for good visualization of land marks.

When using Magnification Views: A CC and ML (true lateral) are obtained. You get a ML (as
opposed to a MLO) to help catch milk of calcium.

When using a True Lateral View ML vs LM: Using a true lateral is useful for localizing things seen on
a single view only (the CC). A trick I use is whatever I said on the screener, is the last letter I'd use
on the call backs. In other words, if it's Lateral on the screener you want an ML on the diagnostic. If
it's Medial on the screener then you want a LM on the diagnostic. The reason is that you are moving
it closer to the receptor. If you see the area of interest on the MLO only (not the CC), you should
pick ML - because most (70%) breast cancers occur laterally. -- This would make a good
multiple choice question.

How many cancers do you need tofin d ? You are trying to find around 3-8 cancers per 1000
mammograms. Another way to ask this is to say that you are supposed to have a Positive Predictive
Value (PPVi) of around 4% (in other words anything other than a BRl or BR2 on a screener). This
is demanded by the various regulating bodies.

Comparisons'. It's recommended to look at mammograms from 2 years prior (if available) for
comparison. Makes it a little easier to see early changes.

                          Basic Artifacts:

Blur: Can be from breathing or inadequate compression (typically along the inferior breast

on the MLO). It can be tricky to pick up. The strategy I like to use is to look at C ooper's
Ligaments - they should be thin white lines in the fat. If they are thick or fuzzy - it is
probably blur (or edema). If there is skin thickening, think edema.
You see blur in 3 scenarios
( 1 ) patient moved,
( 2 ) exposure was too long,
(3 ) exposure was too short.

                              Blur: "Coopers are too thick" ior normal skin

Grid Lines: Basically m am m ogram s always use a grid (unless it's a mag view). That

would make a good multiple choice question actually. No grid on mag views. So, the grid
works by moving really fast, and only keeping x-rays that m ove straight in.
