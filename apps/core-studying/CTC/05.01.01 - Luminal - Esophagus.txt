A R m g: The muscular ring above the
vestibule. Dynamic on swallow.

B Rine: The mucosal ring Below the                     H\a^a'
vestibule. Not Dynamic. This is a thin                 Hert"a
constriction at the GE junction. Symptomatic
dysphagia can occur if it narrows (historically
defined at <13m m in diameter). If it's
narrowed (and symptomatic) you call it a
Schatzki. Just Say "Shatz-`B '-R in g "

Z Line: Represents the squamocolumnar
junction (boundary between esophageal and gastric epithelium). This doesn't necessarily
correspond with the B-ring. This is an endoscopy finding, and is only rarely seen as a thin
serrated line.

Mucosa should have thin, parallel uniform folds.

Special Topic - Which Hand Does the Barium Go In ?

According to historical records, Left and Right Posterior Obhque positions were commonly
used when performing a thoracic barium swallow exam. So which hand should the barium
cup go in ??? The trick is to consider the potential for the barium filled cup to obscure the
field o f view as the patient is drinking. If the cup is placed in the more anterior hand this
could happen... so don't do that.

Cancer: On barium you want to see the words "irregular
co n to u r", and "abrupt (shouldered) edges. " I like to use
stereotypes to remember the subtypes and associations:

Squamous: This is a black guy who drinks and smokes, and
once tried to kill him self with an alkaloid ingestion (drank
lye). The stricture/ulcer/mass is in the mid esophagus.

Adeno: This is a white guy, who is stressed out all the time.
He has chronic reflux (history of PPI use). He had a scope
years ago that showed Barretts, and he did nothing because
he was too busy stressing out about stuff. The stricture/ulcer/
mass is in the lower esophagus.

Critical Stage: T3 (Adventitia) vs T4 (invasion into adjacent structures) - obviously you need
CT to do this. The earlier stages are distinguished by endoscopy - so not your problem and
unlikely to be tested. T3 vs T4 is in the radiologists world - and therefore the most likely to be
tested.

Herniation of the stomach comes in several
flavors with the most common being the sliding
type 1 (95%), and the rolling para-esophageal
type 2. The distinction between the two is
based on the position of the GE junction.

Small type Is are often asymptomatic but do                    P vM\

have an association with reflux if the function of Sliding (Type 1) GE Para-E (Type 2) GE

                                         Fundoplication Blitz

What is this Fundoplication ? The gastric fundus is
wrapped around the lower end of the esophagus and
stitched in place, reinforcing the lower esophageal
sphincter. The term "Nissen" - refers to a 360 degree
wrap. Loose ( < 360) wraps can also be done, and
have French sounding names like "toupet," - these are
less high yield.

Early Complication: The early problem with these is
esophageal obstruction (or narrowing). This occurs
from either post op edema, or a wrap made too tight.
You see this peak around week 2. Barium will show
total or near total obstruction o f the esophagus.

Failure: There are two main indications for the procedure (1) hiatal hernia, and (2) reflux. So
failure is defined by recurrence of either of these. The most common reason for recurrent reflux is
telescoping of the GE junction through the wrap - or a "slipped Nissen."

 Most common reason fo r recurrent reflux ?= slipped Nissen

 Most common reasonfo r slipped Nissen ? = short esophagus

 WTF is a "short esophagus " ? The exact       Down
  definition is elusive (and depends on the
  phase of the moon). For the purpose of
  multiple choice test I'd go with "Hiatal
  Hernia that isfixed/non- reducible, and
  greater than 5cm "

 How can you tell i f the wrap has slipped ?
  Fundoplication wrap should have length
  of narrowed esophagus < 2cm (anything
  greater suggests a slipped wrap)

 Remember recurrent hernia (GE junction
  above the diaphragm) is not normal.

What is the treatmentfor a "short esophagus" ?
Collis gastroplasty (lengthening + fundoplication).

Trivia: You cannot vomit after a fundoplication (no matter how bad your wife's cooking is)

              The Dilated Esophagus

If you get shown a big dilated esophagus (full cheerios, mashed potatoes, and McDonald's
french fries... or "freedom fries" as I call them), you will need to think about 3 things.

(1) Achalasia: A motor disorder where the distal 2/3 of the esophagus (smooth muscle part)
doesn't have normal peristalsis ( "absent primary peristalsis "), and the lower esophageal
sphincter won't relax.

The esophagus will be dilated above a smooth stricture at
the GE junction (Bird's Beak).

 "Vigorous Achalasia " - An early / less severe form which
classically has repetitive simultaneous non-propulsive
contractions. It's more common in women, but the
secondary cancer occurs more in men.

Things to know:

          Failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax
          Increased risk of Candida

"Chagas Disease " - More common in the jungle. The
esophagus get paralyzed by some parasite transmitted by
a fly. The appearance is identical to Achalasia - and some
people even lump them together (others reserve the term
"achalasia" for idiopathic types only). You'll simply need
to read the mind of the test question writer to know what
camp he/she falls into.

(2) "Pseudoachalasia" (secondary achalasia) has the appearance of achalasia, but is secondary
to a cancer at the GE junction. The difference is that real Achalasia will eventually relax, the
pseudo won't. They have to show you the mass - or hint at it, or straight up tell you that the GE
junction didn't relax. Alternatively they could be sneaky and just list a bunch of cancer risk
factors (smoking, drinking, chronic reflux) in the question stem. Next step would probably be
CT (or full on upper GI).

(3) Scleroderma: Involves the esophagus 80%

of the time. Again the lower 2/3 of the

esophagus stops working normally. The LES

is incompetent and you end up with chronic

reflux, which can cause scarring, Barretts, and

even cancer (Adeno). They will show you

lung changes (most commonly NSIP), and the

barium esophagus (or a small bowel series             % 

showing closely spaced valvulae conniventes -

hide bound).

Varices:

Linear often serpentine, filling defects causing a
scalloped contour.

The differential diagnosis for varices includes
varicoid carcinoma (this is why you need them
distended on the study).
