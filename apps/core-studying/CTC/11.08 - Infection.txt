   Intraaxial Infections: Abscess Continued, with Cerebritis, & Ventriculitis

Abscess: A cerebral abscess is a cavity that contains pus, debris, and necrotic tissue. These can

develop secondary to bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infection - most commonly via hematogenous
spread. For the purpose of multiple choice, remember to think about right-to-left shunts and
pulmonary AVMs. Direct spread (example = sinus) is possible, but just less common because of
the dura.

The smooth margin suggests Abscess, but
doesn't exclude mets. The difference is that
tumor usually starts out as a solid enhancing
mass then becomes ring enhancing with
necrosis. Also. Abscesses tend to be smaller
(usually less than 10mm).

Cerebritis is the early form of intra-axial          Ventriculitis: Usually the result of a shunt

infection, which can lead to Abscess if not          placement or intrathecal chemo - as discussed

MRI Gamesmanship - Enhancement Panems:

In general, to solve MR puzzles you will need to be able to work through some MR sequences. The
trick is to have a list of things that are T1 bright, T2 bright. Restrict diffusion, and Enhance. Plus you
should know the basic enhancement patterns (homogenous, heterogenous, ring, and incomplete ring).

                    STROKE vs TUMOR vs ABSCESS vs MS Plaque

T2: For the most part, T2 is not super helpful for lesion characterization
- as stroke, tumors, abscess, MS, all have edema.

DWI: This is helpful only if they follow the classic rules. Out of those 4 (stroke, tumors, abscess, MS)
the classical diffusion restrictors are: Abscess, and Stroke. Certain hypercellular tumors (classically
lymphoma) can restrict, and demyelinating lesions with acute features can restrict.

Enhancement: In this situation this is probably the most helpful.
Out of those 4 (Tumor, Abscess, MS, and Stroke) each should have a different pattern.

 Tumor usually heterogeneous or homogenous if high grade              How Many Rings ?
   (or none if low grade). Technically ring enhancement can
   also be seen with Gliomas, and Mets (though I expect this  The number of rings can be a helpful

                                                              to be tumor (around half of mets and
 Abscess will classically have RING pattern.                 3/4 of gliomas are solitary).

 MS will classically have an INCOMPLETE RING pattern.        Abscess and MS Lesions are almost
                                                              always (like 75-85%) muhiple.
 Stroke will have cortical ribbon (GYRIFORM) type
   enhancement in the sub-acute time period (around 1 week).

MRI Gamesmanship - Oorpns Caiiesum:

Crossing the corpus callosum is a classic gamesmanship device.
Things that do this;

 Tumor: Lymphoma (most classic), GBM
 Post Treatment: Radiation Necrosis
 Demyelination; Big Tumefactive MS Plaque, Marchiafava-Bignami
 Infection: Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)
 Trauma: Diffuse Axonal Injury
 Weird Shit: transient lesions of the splenium of the corpus callosum -

  cytotoxic stuff often from seizure medications (oval spot in the splenium)

The classic thing that does NOT occur is an infarct. Not that it can't happen,
it is just super rare - the corpus callosum has a redundant rich blood supply.
