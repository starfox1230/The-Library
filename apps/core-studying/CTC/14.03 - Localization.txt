Be aware that ccrtain areas can sometimes only be seen on a
single view. For example, the medial breast on a CC may
not be seen on MLO, and the Inferior Posterior Breast on
MLO may be excluded from the CC. That makes these
areas "high risk" for missing a cancer.

Localizing a lesion (only seen in              Inferior
the MLO view):                                Posterior

This is a very basic skill, but if you           Breast

mammography or just terrible              excluded on
training, a refresher might be useful     the CC View
as this is applicable to multiple
choice tests. A lesion that is seen in                        Medial Breast
the MLO only will rise on the true                                 - Can be excluded on the

CC film. A lesion that is seen on
the MLO only will fall on the tme
lateral (ML) if it is lateral on the CC
film.

The popular mnemonic is "Lead
Sinks, and Mujfins Rise " - L for
lateral, and M for medial.

Localization Strategy Continued - A Systematic Approach

First let me familiarize you with the

clock face as a tool to localize       

"nodules." Breasts can be thought of

similar to a clock - as shown.

                                       The posterior nipple line for the right and left breast
                                       start in the upper inner quadrant, extend through the
                                       nipple, and exit through the outer quadrant.

STEPl: Find the           STEP 2: Draw a second           STEP 3: Using your knowledge of
"nodule" on the MLO       line [dotted line] that passes  the clock face draw the PNL (grey)
and localize it above or  through the "nodule" and is     and your second line (dotted) -
below the Posterior       parallel to the PNL.            either above or below the PNL
Nipple Line (PNL).        Measure the distance            depending on the location.
                          between the Hnes.

Above PNL

STEP 4: Find                                             STEP 5: Use the same clock face to
the "nodule" on                                          mark the nodule as medial / lateral and
the CC.                                                  central / peripheral.

Is it lateral or                                                                                                                             T3
medial ?
                                                                                                                                                                                                               <L>
Is it central or
peripheral ?                                                   Peripheral Central Peripheral
                                       But Prometheus ?! It is above the nipple on the MLO...

                                                              Remember nodules below the nipple
                                                                 project above the nipple on MLO.

Practice Cases

 Case 1

                                   Nodule below the PNL
                                   on the MLO - so we
                                   draw a dotted line
                                   below the first line
                                   (same orientation)

                                                         Nodule (medial) rises in its location
                                                         above the nipple (if we measured we
                                                         could be more exact -- this is just rough
                                                         and dirty). - "muffins rise"

Case 2

        Nodule below the PNL                             Nodule is now seen
        on the MLO - so we                               medial / peripheral
        draw a dotted line                               on CC -- so we
        below the first line                             follow along that
        (same orientation)                               dotted line till we are
                                                         in a medial
                                                         peripheral location,

Case 2 is a greater distance from the PNL than Case      Nodule (medial) rises in its location at /
1 so the line moves as well -- remember we could         above the nipple (if we measured we could
measure and be more exact if needed                      be more exact -- this is just rough and
                                                         dirty). - "muffins rise"

Localizing a lesion (only seen in the CC view): Sometimes you can only see the finding in
the CC view. I f you w ant to further characterize it with ultrasound, figuring out if it's in the
superior or inferior breast could be very helpful. One m ethod for doing this is a "rolled CC
view."

R olled CC View: This works by positioning the breast for a CC view, but prior to placing the
breast in compression you rotate the breast either medial or lateral along the axis o f the
nipple. Your reference point is the top o f the breast.

· If you roll the breast medial; a superior tumor will move medial, an inferior tumor will
     move lateral.

· If you roll the breast lateral; a superior tumor will move lateral, an inferior tumor will
     move medial.

In other words, superior tumors move in the direction you roll and inferior tumors move
in the opposite direction you roll. The "su p e rio r" vs "in fe rio r" is inferred based on how it
moves when you (the tech) roll the boob.

Cancer In superior breast   Rolled MediallyCC view,   Rolled LateraIly CC view,
only seen inCC view         moves the cancer medial   moves the cancer laterally
