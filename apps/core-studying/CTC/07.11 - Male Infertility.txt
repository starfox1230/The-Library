Causes: Can be thought o f as Obstructive vs Non-Obstructive

      Obstructive: Congenital bilateral absence o f the vas deferens (seen in Cystic
          Fibrosis), ejaculatory duct obstruction, prostatic cysts. Think about associated
          renal anomalies (Zinner Syndrome).

     * Non-Obstructive: Varicocele, Cryptorchidism, Anabolic Steroid Use, Erectile
          Dysfunction and "The Liberal Media."

Varicocele: This is the most common correctable cause of infertility. They can be
unilateral or bilateral. Unilateral is much more common on the left. Isolated right sided
should make you think retroperitoneal process compressing the right gonadal vein.

Cryptorchidism: Undescended testes. The testicle is usually found in the inguinal
canal. The testicle has an increased risk o f cancer (actually they both will - which is weird).
It's most com m only seen in prem ature kids (20%).

Major complication association fo r cryptorchidism:
 Malignant degeneration - of both the undescended and contralateral testicle
 Infertility
 Torsion
 Bowel Incarceration - related to the association o f indirect inguinal hernia

                Gamesmanship: A good distractor w ould be "orchitis." It's a pathology that
                involves the balls, so it's not totally far fetched. O bviously they can get
                orchitis... but not at a higher rate. It's not a reported association - so don't fall
                for that.
