                     Tumors and Tumor Like Conditions:

R etinoblastom a - This is the most common prim ary malignancy o f the globe. If you see
calcification in the globe of a child - this is the answer.

The step 1 question is RB suppressor gene (chromosome 13 -- "unlucky 13"). That's the same
chromosome osteosarcoma patients have issues with and why these guys are at increased risk of
facial osteosarcoma after radiation.
The globe should be normal in size (or bigger), where C oats' is usually smaller. It's usually seen
before age 3 (rare after age 6). The trivia is gonna be where else it occurs. They can be bilateral
(both eyes - 30%), trilateral (both eyes and the pineal gland), and quadrilateral (both eyes,
pineal, and suprasellar).

C oats' D isease - The cause o f this is retinal telangiectasia which results   CT - Dense
in leaky blood and subretinal exudate. It can lead to retinal detachment. It's  T1 - Hyper
seen in young boys and typically unilateral. The key detail is that it is NOT   T2 - Hyper
CALCIFIED (retinoblastom a is).

Coats disease has a smaller globe. Retinoblastoma has a normal sized globe.

Persistent Hyperplastic Prim ary Vitreous (PHPV) -

This is a failure o f the embryonic ocular blood supply to regress. It can lead to retinal
detachment. The classic look is a small eye (m icrophthalm ia) with increased density of
the vitreous. No calcification.

Retinal Detachment - This can occur
secondary to PHPV or Coats. It can also be
causcd by trauma, sickle cell, or just old age.
The imaging finding is a "V" or "Y" shaped
appearance due to lifted up retinal leaves and
subretinal fluid.

Retinoblastoma - Normal Size                     PH PV - Small Size (Normal Birth Age)
Toxocariasis - Normal Size                       Retinopathy o f Prematurity - Bilateral Small
                                                 C oats' - Smaller Size

M elanom a - This is the most common intra-occular lesion in an adult. If you see an
enhancing soft tissue mass in the back o f an adult's eye this is the answer.

Here are 4 ways you could ask a question about this:
(1) show a picture - what is it?,
(2) ask what the most common intra-occular lesion in an adult is?
(3) ask the buzzword "collar button shaped" ? - which is related to

     Bruch's membrane,
(4) strong predilection for liver mets - next step Liver MR.

Optic N erve Glioma: These almost always (90%)
occur under the age o f 20. You see expansion / enlargement
of the entire nerve. If they are bilateral you think about
NF-1. They are m ost often W HO grade 1 Pilocytic
Astrocytomas. If they are sporadic they can be GBMs and
absolutely destroy you.

Optic Nerve Sheath Meningioma: The buzzword                  "Tram-Track" = Meningioma
is "tram -track" calcifications. A nother buzzw ord is
"doughnut" appearance, with circumferential enhancement
around the optic nerve.

Derm oid: This is the most common benign
congenital orbital mass.

It's usually superior and lateral, arising from the
frontozygomatic suture, and presenting in the first
10 years o f life. It's gonna have fat in it (like any
good dermoid). The location is classic.

                                                        Orbital Dermoid - Classic Location

R habdom yosarcom a - Most common extra-occiilar orbital malignancy in children
(dermoid is most common benign orbital mass in child). Favors the superior-medial orbit and
classically has bone destruction. Just think "bulky orbital mass in a 7 year old."

When they do occur - 40% o f the time it's in the head and neck - and then most commonly it's in
the orbit. It's still rare as hell.

Lym phom a - There is an association with Chlamydia Psittaci (the bird fever thing) and
MALT lymphoma o f the orbit. It usually involves the upper outer orbit - closely associated with
the lacrimal gland. It will enhance homogeneously and restricts diffusion - ju st like in the brain.

274
M e ta s ta tic N eu ro blasto m a - Classic appearance of "Raccoon Eyes" on physical exam.

The classic location is periorbital tumor infiltration
with associatedproptosis. Don't forget a basilar skull
fracture can also cause Raccoon Eyes... so clinical
correlation is advised.

Another thing worth mentioning is the bony
involvement of the greater wing of the sphenoid.
Neuroblastoma is gonna be bilateral. Ewings favors
this location also - but will be unilateral.

M etastatic Scirrhous (fibrosing)

Breast Cancer -

This is classic gamesmanship here. The important
point to know is that unlike primary orbital tumors
that are going to cause proptosis, classically the
breast cancer met causes a desmoplastic reaction
and enophthalmos (posterior displacement o f the
globe).

Trivia: Mets are actually more common to the eye     Infiltrative retrobulbar mass + enophthalmos
relative to the orbit (like 8x more common).         scirrhous carcinoma of the breast

Pre-Septal/ Post-Septal Cellulitis -

As above, location of orbital infections are described by their relationship to the orbital septum. The
testable trivia is probably (1) that the orbital septum originates from the periosteum of the orbit and
inserts in the palpebral tissue along the tarsal plate, (2) that pre-septal infections usually start in
adjacent structures (likely teeth and the face), (3) post-septal infections are usually from paranasal
sinusitis, and (4) pre-septal infections are treated medically, post septal is surgical.

Trivia: Periorbital abscess can cause thrombosis of the ophthalmic veins or cavernous sinus (in
extreme examples infection -- usually aspergillosis -- can even cause a cavemous-carotid fistula).

Dacryocystitis -

This is inflammation and dilation of the
lacrimal sac. It has an Aunt Minnie
look, with a well circumscribed, round
rim enhancing lesion centered in the
lacrimal fossa. The etiology is typically
obstruction followed by bacterial
infection (staph and strep).

Usually this is diagnosed clinically unless there is an associated peri-orbital cellulitis m which can
CT is needed to exclude post septal infection (treated surgically) from simple dacryocystitis
(treated non-surgically).

Orbital Subperiosteal Abscess:

If you get inflammation under the periosteum
it can progress to abscess formation.

This is usually associated with ethmoid
sinusitis. This also has a very classic look.

                            Misc Orbital Conditions

Optic Neuritis:
There will be enhancement of the optic
nerve, without enlargement of the nerve/
sheath complex. Usually (70%) unilateral,
and painful.
You will often see intracranial or spinal cord
demyelination - in the setting o f Devics
(neuromyelitis optica). 50% o f patient's with
acute optic neuritis will develop MS.

             If the optic nerve is enlarged, think glioma... then think NF-1.

P ap illed em a:
This is really an eye exam thing.
Having said that you can sometimes see dilation/ swelling of the optic nerve sheath.

This is a focal discontinuity o f the globe
(failure o f the choroid fissure to close).
They are usually posterior. If you see a
unilateral one - think sporadic.

If you see bilateral ones - think CHARGE
(coloboma, heart, GU, ears).
