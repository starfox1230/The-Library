Vertebroplasty

There is a paper in the NEJM that says this doesn't work. Having said that, NEJM doesn't like
any procedures. They're run by family medicine doctors. They are equally amoral to the
person that will do any non-indicated procedure. Regardless o f the actual legitimacy, it's a big
cash cow and several prominent Radiologists have made their names on it... so it will be
tested on as if it's totally legit and without controversy.

Trivia to Know:

     D Indications = Acute to subacute fracture with pain refractory to medical therapy or an
          unstable fracture with associated risk if further collapse occurs.

     D Contraindications = Fractures with associated spinal canal compression or improving
          pain without augmentation.

   D There is a risk o f developing a new vertebral fracture in about 25% o f cases. The

          literature says you should "counsel patients on the needfo r additional treatments
         prior to undergoing vertebroplasty.

   D The cement can embolize to the lungs.
   D Risk of local neurologic complications are about 5%.

Lymphangiogram:

1950 called and they want to stage this cancer. Prior to CT, MRI, and US injecting dye into
the toes was actually a way to help stage malignancy (mets to lymph nodes, lymphoma, etc..).

Another slightly more modem application is to use this process as the first step in the
embolization o f the thoracic duct. W hy would you take down the thoracic duct? If it's
leaking chylous pleural effusions - status post getting hacked to pieces by a good for nothing
Surgery Resident.

Technical Trivia:

This is done by first injecting about 0.5 cc methylene blue dye in between the toes bilaterally.
You then wait half an hour until the blue lymphatic channels are visualized. You then cut
down over the lymphatic channels and cannulate with a 27 or 30 gauge lymphangiography
needle. An injection with lipiodol is done (maximum 20 ml if no leak). I f you inject too
much there is a risk o f oil pneumonitis. You take spot films in a serial fashion until the
cistema chyli (the sac at the bottom o f the thoracic duct) is opacified. At that point you could
puncture it directly and superselect the thoracic duct to embolize it, typically with coils.

standing Waves:

Standing waves are an angiographic phenomenon (usually) that results in a ringed layering
o f contrast that sorta looks like FMD. A common trick is to try and make you pick between
FMD and Standing Waves.

Obviously it's bullshit because in real life standing waves typically resolve prior to a
second run through the same vessel, and even if they stayed around they tend to shift
position between each run (up or down). FMD on the other hand is an actual physical
irregularity o f the vessel wall so it's fixed betw een runs and doesn't go away.

Morphology should be your strategyfo r multiple  \l
choice:

Standing waves are very symmetric and evenly
spaced.

FMD is more irregular and asymmetric.

                Superficial or Deep? - Understanding Geometry

Sometimes it's difficult to tell if you are superficial or deep to the lesion you are trying to
put a needle in under fiuoro. You can problem solve by tilting the LI. towards the patient's
head or towards the patient's feet.

If you tilt towards the head, a superficial needle will be shorter but a deep needle will look
longer.

If you tilt towards the feet, a superficial needle will be longer but a deep needle will look
shorter.

Sedation Related:

      "Conscious Sedation" is considered "m oderate sedation", and the patient should be
          able to respond briskly to stimuli (verbal commands, or light touch). No airway
          intervention should be needed.

Local Anesthesia (Lidocaine)

· M aximum Dose is 4-5 mg/kg
· A dirty trick would be to say - "Lido with Epi" - in which case it is 7 mg/kg
· Some basic scrub nurse math:

          · 1% Plain Epi - 10 mg per I mL
          · So 1 mg per 0.1 mL
          · And we said Maximum Dose is 5 mg/kg, so it would be equal to 0.5 mL / kg
· Remember that small doses in the right spot can cause a serious reaction.
     · 150 mg in the thecal sac can cause total spine anesthesia and the need for a
          ventilator.
     · Direct arterial injection can cause immediate seizures.
     · Tinnitus and dizziness are the earliest signs o f toxicity.
· Local anesthesia agents have a low potential for allergy - although it can still occur, it's
     usually a bogus allergy once a real history is taken. M ost "allergies" to lidocaine are
     actually vaso-vagal, or other CV side effects from epinephrine mixed with lidocaine
· There are elaborate mechanisms for testing for a true allergy, or reaction to
     methylparaben (a preservative).
· So what if the allergy is real? or you can't prove it's false? - Some texts describe using
     an antihistamine such as diphenydramine (which can have anesthetic properties).
