Salpingitis Istiimica Nodosa (SIN):

This is a nodular scarring o f the fallopian tubes that
produces an Aunt Minnie Appearance. As trivia, it
usually involves the proximal 2/3 o f the tube. This is
o f unlmown etiology, but likely post inflammatory /
infectious (i.e. being a woman o f questionable moral
standard / "free spirit").
It's strongly associated with infertility and ectopic
pregnancy and that is likely the question.

Uterine AViVI - These can be congenital or acquired, w ith acquired types being way more
common. They can be serious business and you can totally bleed to death from them. The typical
ways to acquire them include; previous dilation and curettage, therapeutic abortion, caesarean
section, or just multiple pregnancies.

myometrium with high velocity color Doppler flow.

surgery, or pregnancy. If the patient was a liberal arts
major - you can assume infection / PID. A history of
international travel would make you think about the classic
GU TB.

This is typically shown on HSG, with either (a) non filling
of the uterus, or (b) multiple irregular linear filling defects
(lacunar pattern), with inability to appropriately distend
the endometrial canal. MRI would show a bunch of T2
dark bands. Clinically, this results in infertility.

Endometritis - This is in the spectrum o f PID. You often see it 2-5 days after delivery,

especially in women with prolonged labor or premature rupture. You are going to have fluid and
a thickened endometrial cavity. You can have gas in the cavity (not specific in a postpartum
women). It can progress to pyometrium, which is when you have expansion with pus.

Getting old and having a bunch of kids can sometimes make stuflfhang out of your vagina and cause you to
pee your pants (when you don't actually want to pee your pants). It is important to make that distinction
between "prolapse" (stuff hanging out of your vagina), and "relaxation" (peeing and/or pooping your pants
when you sneeze). Both are bad... although one is worse - I'll let you decide which one that is.

Anatomy Review: This anatomy is complicated - buncha fascial bands "ligaments" muscles etc... creating a
"sling" which keeps all this stuff from falling out the bottom. The best way to think about the pelvic sling of a
female is to group it into 3 functional compartments: Anterior compartment (bladder and urethra), Middle
compartment (vagina, cervix, uterus, and adnexa), and Posterior compartment (anus and rectum). This anatomy
is incredibly complex - but a few of these vocab terms could make easy questions:

Endopelvic fascia: Buncha ligaments / fascia (pubocervical fascia, rectovaginal fascia, cardinal ligaments,
etc..) most of which have vaginal or cervix in the name. Main support for the anterior & middle compartments.

Levator ani: This is the main muscular component of the pelvic floor composed of the puborectalis,
pubococcygeus, and iliococcygeus. This muscle groups constant contraction maintains the pelvic floor height.

Urogenital diaphragm: This is the most caudal or superficial musculofascial structure. It does not have a
marketable sex toy name (unlike Levator Ani). This thing usually finds it way into multiple choice exams as
the anatomic landmark used in the classification of urethral injury - as discussed in the GU chapter.
