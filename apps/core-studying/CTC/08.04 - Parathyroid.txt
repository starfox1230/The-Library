                                   Pa r a -Thyroid

Anatomy: There are norm ally 4 parathyroid glands located posterior to the thyroid. The
step 1 trivia is that the superior 2 are from the 4th branchial pouch, and the inferior 2 are
from the 3rd branchial pouch. The inferior two are more likely to be in an ectopic location.
Parathyroid Adenoma: This is by far the m ost com m on cause o f
hyperparathyroidism (90%). On ultrasound these things look like hypoechoic beans
posterior to the thyroid. A 4D-CT can be used to demonstrate early wash-in and delayed
wash-out. Nuclear medicine can use two techniques (1) the single-tracer, dual-phase
Sestamibi, or (2) the dual tracer Sestamibi +1-123 (or Pertechnetate). These are discussed
in detail in the nukes section.

        Parathyroid Adenoma - 4D C T shows early enhancement, and delayed washout

Parathyroid Carcinoma: This is pretty uncom m on, and only makes up about 1% o f
the causes of hyperparathyroidism. It looks exactly like an adenoma on imaging. The only
way you can tell on imaging is if they show you cervical adenopathy or invasion o f adjacent
structures.

                     High Yield Parathyroid Trivia:
