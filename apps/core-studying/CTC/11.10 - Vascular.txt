broadly categorize stroke into ischemic (80%) and
hemorrhagic (20%). It's critical to remember that
stroke is a clinical diagnosis and that imaging
findings compliment the diagnosis (and help
exclude clinical mimic of stroke - tumor etc..).

Vascular Territories: The diagram to the right

venous infarcts.                                                    Absent collateral flow

Venous Infarct:

Not all infarcts are arterial, you can also stroke secondary to venous occlusion (usually the sequelae
of dural venous sinus thrombosis or deep cerebral vein thrombosis). In general, venous infarcts are at
higher risk for hemorrhagic transfonnation. In little babies think dehydration, in older children think
about mastoiditis, in adults think about coagulopathies (protein C & S def) and oral contraceptives.
The most common site of thrombosis is the superior sagittal sinus, with associated infarct occurring
75% of the time.

Venous thrombosis can present as a dense sinus (on non-contrast CT) or "empty delta" (on contrast
enhanced CT). Venous infarcts tend to have heterogeneous restricted diffusion. Venous thrombosis
can result in vasogenic edema that eventually progresses to stroke and cytotoxic edema.

          Arterial stroke = Cytotoxic Edema

          Venous Stroke = Vasogenic Edema + Cytotoxic Edema

Stigmata of chronic venous thrombosis include the development of a dural AVF, and/or
increased CSF pressure from impaired drainage.

                      ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score)

This was developed to give "providers" a more specific guideline for giving TPA - as an
alternative to the previous 1/3 vascular territory rule. The idea being that the greater the vascular
territory involved, the worse the chnical outcome (post TPA bleed etc..).

The way this works is that you start out with 10 points, and lose points based on findings of acute
cytotoxic ischemia to various locations (example: minus 1 for caudate, or lentiform nucleus, or
insular ribbon, etc.. etc.. so on and so forth).

Testable Pearls:

· This is for MCA ONLY (not other vascular territories)

· This is for ACUTE ischemia (don't subtract points for chronic lacunar infarcts etc..)

· A score of 8 or greater has a better chance of a good outcome (score of 7 or less may
  contraindicate TPA -- depending on the institutional policy.

                                  CT Perfusion - Crash Course

After an arterial occlusion perfiasion pressure is going to be rapidly reduced. Millions of neurons will
suddenly cry out in terror then suddenly be silenced, unless they are lucky to have arteriolar dilation
with capillary recruitment to bring in as much blood to that area of brain as possible. This process is
called physiologic auto-regulation and should result in an increase in capillary blood pool. The key
point is that you need live neurons (penumbra) to cry out for help. If they cry out and are suddenly
silenced (infarct core) you won't see any auto regulation attempts. This physiology makes up the
basis of perfusion for stroke.

Parameters:

· Cerebral Blood Flow (CBFy Represents instantaneous capillary flow in tissue.

· Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV): Describes the blood volume of the cerebral capillaries and venules
  per cerebral tissue volume.

· Mean Transit Time (MIT) = CBV divided by CBF ; it is the average length of time a certain
  volume of blood is present in the capillary circulation.

· Time to Peak (TTP): This is the opposite of CBF. Less flow = Longer Time to reach maximum
  concentration of contrast.

Habenular - Curvilinear structure (solid white arrow) located a few
millimeters anterior to the pineal body (open arrow). About 1 in 5

association with schizophrenia.

Choroid plexus - Common in adults. Remember there is no choroid
plexus in the frontal/occipital horn of the lateral ventricles or the
cerebral aqueduct.

Dural Calcifications - Common in adults. If the calcs are bulky and
there are a bunch of tooth cysts (Odontogenic keratocysts) think Gorlin
Svndrome.

Basal Ganglia - Very common with age, favors the globus pallidus. If
extensive & symmetrical think Fahr disease.

Vasospasm

Vessels do not like to be bathed in blood (SAH), it makes them freak out (spasm). The classic timing
for this is 4-14 days after SAH (NOT immediately). It usually looks like smooth, long segments of
stenosis. It typically involves multiple vascular territories. It can lead to stroke- in fact vasospasm is
considered a greater risk than rebleeding for mortality / morbidity (according to some sources).

Who gets it? It's usually in patients with SAH and the more volume of SAH the greater the risk. In
1980 some neurosurgeon came up with this thing called the Fisher Score, which grades vasospasm
risk. The gist of it is greater than 1 mm in thickness or intraventricular / parenchymal extension is at
higher risk.

Are there Non-SAH causes o f vasospasm? Yep. Meningitis, PRES, and Migraine Headache.

Critical Take Home Point - Vasospasm is a delayed side effect of SAH. It does NOT occur
immediately after a bleed. You see it 4-14 days after SAH.

Vascular Dissection

Vascular dissection can occur from a variety of
etiologies (usually penetrating trauma, or a trip
to the chiropractor).

Penetrating trauma tends to favor the carotids,
and blunt trauma tends to favor the vertebrals.

This would be way too easy to show on CT as a       "Crescent Sign" oi Dissection
flap, so if it's shown it's much more likely to be  - it's the T1 bright intramural blood.
the T1 bright "crescent sign", or intramural
hematoma.

When to Treat Carotid Stenosis
NASCET Criteria:

The North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy

Trial (NASCET) criteria, are used for carotid stenosis.                                     B

The rule is: measure the degree o f stenosis using the       1- A
maximum internal carotid artery stenosis ( "A ") compared   L BJ
to a parallel (non-curved) segment o f the distal cervical
internal carotid artery ("B ").

You then use the formula:                                          EGA

[1- A/B] X 100% = % stenosis

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is often performed for
symptomatic patients with > 50% stenosis.

Vasculitis

You can have a variety o f causes o f CNS vasculitis. One way to think about it is by clumping
it into (a) Primary CNS vasculitis, (b) Secondary CNS vasculitis from infection, or sarcoid,
(c) systemic vasculitis with CNS involvement, and (d) CNS vasculitis from a systemic disease.

Primary CNS Vasculitis      Primary Angiitis o f the CNS (PACNS)
                            Meningitis (bacterial, TB, Fungal),
Secondary CNS vasculitis    Septic Embolus, Sarcoid,
from infection, or sarcoid   PAN, Temporal A rteritis, W egeners, Takayasu's,
Systemic vasculitis with
CNS involvement              Cocaine Use, RA, SLE, Lym e's
CNS vasculitis from a
Systemic Disease

They all pretty much look the same with multiple segmental areas o f vessel narrowing, with
alternating dilation ("beaded appearance"! You can have focal areas of vascular occlusion.

             Trivia:

              PAN is the Most Common systemic vasculitis to involve the CNS
             (although it is a late finding).

              SLE is the M ost Common Collagen Vascular Disease

Misc Vascular Conditions

M oyamoya - This poorly understood entity (originally described in Japan -- hence the name),
is characterized by progressive non-atherosclerotic stenosis o f the supraclinoid ICA, eventually
leading to occlusion. The progressive stenosis results in an enlargement o f the basal
perforating arteries.

                                   Mechanism / Gamesmanship: W hen I was a medical student, I
                                     had to memorize a bunch o f tiny little tracks and pathways all over
                                     the brain, cerebellum, and spine. It (like many things in m edical
                                     school) made me super angry because it was such a colossal waste
                                     o f time. More PhD bullshit, lumped right in with those step 1
                                     "w hat chrom osom e is that on ? " questions.
                                     Redemption for the PhDs has arrived. Apparently, one o f these
                                     pathways, the ""corticopontine-cerebellarpathway," is actually
                                     important. Sorta....
                                    Allegedly, this pathway connects one cerebral hemisphere to the
                                     opposite cerebellar hemisphere. If the pathway gets disrupted (by
                                     tumor, radiation, etc...), then metabolism shuts down in the
                                     opposite cerebellum even though there is nothing structurally
                                    w rong with it. That is why you get this criss-crossed hypo-
                                    metabolic appearance on FDG-PET.
                                    The trick is to show you the FDG-PET picture, and try and get
                                    you to say there is a pathology in the cerebellum. There isn't! The
                                    cerebellum is normal - the problem is in the opposite cerebrum
                                    where the pathway starts.
