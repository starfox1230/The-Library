            Radiology Master of Sport - National Champion

                   Americans love to fight. Americans love the champion.

This right here is about recognizing a commitment to being the best. Being the best, standing on the
top stand - and more importantly the quest to stand on the top stand and wear the yellow medal is
what I want to recognize.

The quest is very lonely. They say it is lonely at the top - that is not true. I know that on my quest, 1
didn't have any friends on the way there - nobody was getting up at 4am with m e... nobody, not one
person. It was just me - alone. It is lonely getting to the top and that is where most people fall off.
It's Friday and everyone else is going out, or there is a party or whatever - I'm tired and I want to
sleep in. I was on call last night- it is just not worth it. For me that is not what life is. Life is about
being the best person you can be in whatever it is you are doing. That does not have to be Radiology,
but because you are reading this book well that is what it means for you now.

You make the quest. If you get the top score on the exam - I'll be putting your name in this book next
year and you can motivate the next legend of tomorrow. Plus, I 'll give you some money and have an
enormous lion trophy made for you.

The most important thing is not actually winning. People think I only care about winning because I
rant and rave about how only the gold medal count - but the quest is what I really value. I'm not
training for silver. I'm training for gold. The quest for gold is more important than someone handing
you a gold medal. The katana sword of the black dragon society cannot be stolen - it can only be
earned. Outcomes really don't matter, because the truth is in this life you can do everything 100%
perfect and still fail and you can do almost everything wrong and still win. If you don't focus on
outcomes and instead the quest itself you will get something much greater -- besides a high
probability of passing the test - what you can gain from the quest, the ability to really dedicate
yourself to something 100% - it is a skill you can use for the rest of your life. This is the way to
always achieve victory. Once you know the way, you can see it in all things - as the samurai say.

preparation it is very easy to become overwhelmed with despair. Especially, when you start to come
to terms with how much information is potentially testable. So much fucking trivia...

My idea for this first chapter is to help you manage this great challenge. I'm going to share with you
all my secrets. All the strategies that 1employ in my life to battle the forces of evil. You will learn to
embrace the daunting difficulty and repel the forces of evil. I'll share with you my understanding of
emotional utility as you harness your intense venomous hatred not only for the external forces
responsible and those indifferent to your plight, but also for your own internal weakness.

Do not underestimate the difficulty of the task.

Your focus must be relentless. We will not train to be merciful here. Mercy is for the weak.
Here, in the streets, in competition. A multiple choice question confronts you, it is the enemy.
An enemy deserves no mercy. You will become the corporal manifestation of vengeance.
