H angm an's Fractu re:

Seen most commonly when the chin hits the dashboard in an MVA
("direct blow to the face"). The fracture is through the bilateral pars
at C2 (or the pedicles - which is less likely). You will have anterior
subluxation of C2 on C3 (> 2mm). Cord damage is actually uncoimiion
with these, as the acquired pars defect allows for canal widening. There
is often an associated fracture of the anterior inferior comer at C2 -

from avulsion of the anterior longitudinal ligament. Traction is

contraindicated.

Ciiance Fracture:                                    Flexion  Distraction
These are flexion-distraction fractures that are
classically associated with a lap-band seatbelt.
These are 3 column (unstable) fractures.
Most commonly seen at the upper lumbar levels &
thoracolumbar junction.
High association with solid organ trauma.

F a c e t D islocation: This is a spectrum: Subluxed facets -> Perched -> Locked.

Unilateral: [f you have unilateral locked facet (usually from hyperflexion and rotation) the
superior facet slides over the inferior facet and gets locked. The unilateral is a stable injury.
You will have the inverted hamburger sign on axial imaging on the dislocated side.

Atlantoaxial Instability:

The articulation between C l and C2 allows for lateral movement (shaking your head no). The
transverse cruciform ligament straps the dens to the anterior arch o f C l. The distance between
the anterior arch and dens shouldn't be more than 5 mm. The thing to know is the association
with Down syndrome and juvenile RA.

Rotary subluxation can occur in children without a
fracture, with the kid stuck in a "cock-robin"
position - which looks like torticollis. Actually
differentiating from torticollis is difficult and may
require dynamic maneuvers on the scanner.

This never, ever, ever happens in the absence o f a
fracture in an adult (who doesn't have Downs or
RA). Having said that, people over call this all the
time in adults who have their heads turned in the
scanner.

  Pars Interarticularis Defect (Spondylolysis or Adult isthm ic
  S p o ndylolisthesis) : This is also discussed in the Peds chapter (vol 1, page 137).
  I 'll make a few comments for the adult version. Defects in the pars interarticuaris are
  usually caused by repetitive micro-trauma (related to hyper-extension). It is nearly
  always at L5-S1 (90%). Pain is typically a L5 radiculopathy caused by foraminal
  stenosis at L 5-S 1. The term "pseudo-disc" is sometimes used to describe the
  deformed annular fibers seen in the setting o f a related anterolithesis (forward
  slippage).

                                         Instability

You will read different definitions of "instability" as it relates to spinal trauma. The one I prefer
is something along the lines of "lost capacity to withstand even a normal physiologic load
without: potential damage to the spinal cord, nerve roots, or developing an incapacitating
deformity thatforces one to seek employment in a cathedral bell tower. "

For the purpose of multiple choice you will see the words "stable" or "unstable" associated with
specific fracture types. There are also some radiologic "definitions" of instability which seem to
vary depending on who you ask. In general, if you have acute segmental kyphosis greater than 11
degrees, acute anterolisthesis greater than 3-4 mm, or gross motion on flexion / extension imaging
it is probably an unstable fracture. You will also hear people talk about a "power ratio" for
occipitocervical instability, and a spinal column theory for the thoracolumbar injury.
