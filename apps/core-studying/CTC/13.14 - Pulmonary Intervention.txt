Pleural Drainage - Most everyone has done a

few thoracenteses as a resident. I just want to touch on a
few testable points.

 Rem ember that you go "above the rib " to avoid the
  neurovascular bundle.

 If you pull off too much fluid too fast you can possibly                  "Above the Rib"
  get pulm onary edema from re-expansion (this is                 avoid the neurovascular bundle.
  uncommon).

 If it's malignant you m ight end up with a trapped lung (lung w on't expand fully)- in other
  words a thick pleural rind or fibrothorax, can prevent lung reexpansion - makes
  percutaneous drainage pointless in many cases. A "vacu-thorax" - in the setting o f a
  trapped lung, does not m ean anything, and does not need im mediate treatm ent even if it's
  big. If you really need to fix it, you'll need a surgical pleurectom y / decortication.
  Pleurodesis (which can be done to patients with recurrent pleural effusions), does NOT
  help in the setting o f trapped lung.

 Pneumothorax is rare but is probably the m ost com m on com plication (obviously it's more
  common when done blind).

Additional Trivia related to Chest Tubes:

 Continuous air bubbles in the Pleur-evac chamber represent an air leak, either from the
  drainage tubing or from the lung itself. In the setting o f multiple choice - think about a
  bronchopleural fistula.

 INR should generally be < 1.5 prior to placem ent o f a chest tube.

 In the paravertebral region, the intercostal vessels tend to course off o f the ribs and are
  therefore more prone to injury if this route is chosen for chest tube placement

Lung Abscess: Just remember that you can drain an empyema (pus in the pleural

space), but you should NOT drain a lung abscess because you can create a bronchopleural
fistula (some people still do it).

Lung RFA - Radiofrequency ablation o f lung tumors can be perform ed on lesions

between 1.5cm and 5.2cm in diameter. The m ost com m on com plication is pneum othorax
(more rare things like pneumonia, pseudoaneurysm, bronchopleural fistula, and nerve
injury have been reported). The effectiveness o f RPA is similar to external beam radiation
with regard to prim ary lung cancer. The m ajor advantage o f lung RFA is that it has a
limited effect on pulmonary function, and can be performed without concern to prior
therapy.

Imaging (CT and PET) should be performed as a follow up o f therapy. Things that make
you think residual /recurrent disease: nodular peripheral enhancement measuring more than
10 mm , central enhancem ent (any is b a d ) , grow th o f the RFA zone after 3 m onths (after 6
months is considered definite), increased metabolic activity after 2 months, residual activity
centrally (at the burned tumor).

Thoracic Angio:

This section is going to focus on the two main flavors o f pulmonary angio; pulmonary artery
(done for massive PE and puhnonary AVM treatment) and bronchial artery (done for
hemoptysis).

Pulmonary Artery

The primary indications for pulmonary arteriography is diagnosis and treatment o f massive PE
or pulmonary AVM.

Technical Trivia:

The "Grollman" catheter, which is a preshaped 7F, is the classic tool. You get it in the right
ventricle (usually from the femoral vein) and then turn it 180 degrees so the pigtail is pointing
up, then advance it into the outflow tract. Some people will say that a known LBBB is high
risk, and these patients should get prophylactic pacing (because the wire can give you a
RBBB, and RBBB + LBBB = asystole). An important thing to know is that patients with
chronic PE often have pulmonary hypertension. Severe pulmonary hypertension needs to be
evaluated before you inject a bunch of contrast. Pressures should always be measured
before injecting contrast because you may want to reduce your contrast burden. Oh, one last
thing about angio... never ever let someone talk you into injecting contrast through a swan-
ganz catheter. It's a TERRIBLE idea and the stupid catheter will blow apart at the hub. I
would never ever do th at....

Pulmonary AVM - They can occur sporadically. For the purpose o f multiple choice when
you see them think about HHT (Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia / Osier Weber
Rendu). Pulmonary AVMs are most commonly found in the lower lobes (more blood flow)
and can be a source o f right to left shunt (worry about stroke and brain abscess). The rule
o f treating once the afferent (feeding) artery is 3mm is based on some tiny little abstract
and not pow ered at all. Having said that, it's quoted all the time and a frequent source o f
trivia that is easily tested. The prim ary technical goal is to crush the feeding artery (usually
with coils) as close to the sac as possible. You d o n 't w ant that thing reperfusing from
adjacent branches. Pleurisy (self limited) after treatment seems to pretty much always
happen.

Bronchial A rtery

The prim ary indication for pulm onary arteriography is diagnosis and treatm ent o f massive
hemoptysis.

Hemoptysis - Massive hemoptysis (> 300 cc) can equal death. Bronchial artery embolization
is first line treatment (bronchial artery is the culprit 90% o f the time) -- although
pulmonologists will say Bronchoscopy is first line treatm ent (unless it is a w eekend or
holiday - then IR should do it). Unique to the lung, active extravasation is N O T typically
seen with the active bleed. Instead you see tortuous, enlarged bronchial arteries. The main
thing to worry about is cord infarct. For m ultiple choice the m ost likely bad actor is the
``hairpin-shaped" anterior m edullary artery (Adamkiewicz). Em bolizing that thing or
anywhere that can reflux into that thing is an obvious contraindication. If present, those bad
boys typically arise on the left at the level o f the 9th - 12th intercostal artery.

Particles (> 350 micrometers) are used. You want big particles (350-500 um) in the proximal
artery - to slow flow and stop the bleeding (without causing tissue infarct).

Critical D etail: Coils should be avoided - because if it re-bleeds you just jailed yourself out.
Rasmussen Aneurysm is the testable exception - as discussed on the next page.

The vast majority (90% ) of       "Hairpin Turn" o\
bronchial arteries are located    the Anterior
within the lucency formed by      Medullary Artery
the left main bronchus. This is
right around the T 5 -T 6 Level

T here is a ton of vascular
variation but the pattern of an
intercostobronchial trunk on the
right and two bronchial arteries
on the left is most common
(about 40% )

In the lower thoracic / upper lumbar region the primary feeding artery o f the anterior spinal
cord is the legendary anterior radiculom edullary artery (artery o f A dam kiewicz). This
vessel most commonly originates from a left sided posterior intercostal artery (typically
between T 9-T 12), which branches from the aorta. The distal portion o f this artery, as it
merges with the anterior spinal artery, creates the classic (and testable) "hairpin" turn.

It is worth noting that Adam kiewicz can originate from the right bronchus (like 5%).

                                                       435
Special Situation - Rasmussen Aneurysm

This is an aneurysm associated with chronic pulm onary infection, classically TB. The trick
on this is the history o f hemoptysis (which normally makes you think bronchial artery).

   - this is the exception to the rule).

Occlusion of Central Veins (SVC Syndrome) -

Yes - 1 know this really isn 't a pulm onary thing, but it is in the chest so I'm going to talk
about it here.

There are a variety o f ways to address occlusion of     Acute vs Chronic SVC Occlusion:
the SVC. The goal is to return in line flow from at       Acute = No Collaterals
least one jugular vein down through the SVC. Most         Acute = Emergency
commonly throm bolysis is the initial step, although
this is rarely definitive. The offending agent (often a   Chronic = Has Collaterals
catheter) should be removed if possible. If the           Chronic = Not an Emergency
process is non-malignant, often angioplasty alone is
enough to get the job done (post lysis).

Technical Trivia:

 Malignant causes: you should do lysis, then angioplasty, then stent.

 Non-m alignant causes; may still need a stent if the angioplasty doesn't rem ove the
  gradient (if the collateral veins are still present).

 Self-expanding stents should NOT be used, as they tend to migrate.

 The last pearl on this one is not to forget that the pericardium extends to the bottom part o f
  the SVC and that if you tear that you are going to end up with hemopericardium and
  possible tamponade.
