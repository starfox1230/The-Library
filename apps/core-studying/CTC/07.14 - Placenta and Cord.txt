My opinion: Use two cups o f strawberries in the smoothie.

Normal: You can first start to see the placenta around 8 weeks (focal thickening along the
periphery o f the gestational sac). It should be shaped like a disc around 12 weeks. The
normal sonographic appearance is "granular" with a smooth cover (the chorion). Underneath
the basal surface there is a normal retroplacental complex o f decidual and myometrial veins.

N orm al P lacental Aging: As the placenta ages it gets hypoechoic areas, septations, and
randomly distributed calcifications.

Venous Lakes: These are an incidental finding o f no significance. They look like focal
hypoechoic areas under the chorionic membrane (or within the placenta). You can
sometimes see slow flow in them.

Placental Abruption: -- PAINFUL

This is a premature separation o f the placenta from the myometrium. The step 1 history was
always "mother doing cocaine," but it also occurs in the setting o f hypertension. Technically,
subchorionic hemorrhage (marginal abruption) is in the category - as previously discussed.
Retroplacental Abruption is the really bad one. The hematoma will appear as anechoic or
mixed echogenicity beneath the placenta (often extending beneath the chorion).

          Buzzword is "disruption o f the retroplacental complex."

Placenta Previa: -- PAINLESS

This is a low implantation o f the placenta that covers part o f or all o f the internal cervical os. A
practical pearl is that you need to have an empty bladder when you look for this (full bladder
creates a false positive). Several subtypes - as seen in my awesome little chart below.

          Buzzword is "painless vaginal bleeding in the third trimester."

Placenta Chorioangioma:

This is basically a hamartoma o f the placenta, and is the most
common benign tumor of the placenta. These are usually well-
circumscribed hypoechoic masses near the cord insertion. Flow
within the mass pulsating at the fetal heart rate is diagnostic (they
are perfused by the fetal circulation). They almost always mean
nothing, but if they are large (> 4 cm) and multiple
("choriangiomatosis") they can sequester platelets, and cause a
high output failure (hydrops).

                             - Umbilical Cord -

Normal Cord: Should have 3 vessels (2 arteries, 1 vein).

Two Vessel Cord: This is a normal variant - seen in about 1% o f pregnancies. Usually the
left artery is the one missing. This tends to occur more in twin pregnancies and maternal
diabetes. There is an increased association with chromosomal anomalies and various fetal
malformations (so look closely). Having said that, in isolation it doesn't mean much.

Velamentous Cord insertion:               Normal          Velamentous

This is the term for when the cord
inserts into the fetal membranes
outside the placental margin, and
then has to travel back through
the membranes to the placenta
(between the amnion and the
chorion). It's more common
with twins, and increases the risk
of intra-uterine growth restriction
and growth discordance among
twins.

Marginal Cord Insertion:
This is basically almost a
velamentous insertion (cord is
within 2 cm o f the placental
margin). It's also seen more in
twin pregnancies.

Vasa Previa: Fetal vessels that cross (or almost cross) the internal cervical os. It's seen more
in twin pregnancies, and variant placental morphologies. There are two types:
·Type 1: Fetal vessels connect to a velamentous cord insertion within the main placental body
·Type 2: Fetal vessels connect to a bilobed placenta or succenturiate lobe.

Nuchal Cord: This is the term used to describe a cord wrapped around the neck o f the fetus.
Obviously this can cause problems during delivery.

Umbilical Cord Cyst: These are common (seen about 3% o f the time) and are usually
single (but can be multiple). As a point of completely irrelevant trivia, you can divide these into
false and true cysts. True cysts are less common, but have fancy names so they are more likely to
be tested. Just know that the omphalomesenteric duct cyst is usually peripheral, and the allantoic
cyst is usually central. If the cysts persist into the 2"^ or 3''^ trimester then they might be
associated with trisomy 18 and 13. You should look close for other problems.
