The Uterus - Changes During Life

  Neonate - Uterus is larger than you would think for a baby (maternal / placental hormones
  are still working). If you look close, the shape is a little w eird with the cervix often larger
  than the fundus.

  Prepuberty - The shape o f the uterus changes - becoming more tube-like, with the cervix
  and uterus the same size.

  Puberty - The shape o f the uterus changes again, now looking more like an adult (pear-like)
  - with the fundus larger than the cervix. In puberty, the uterus starts to have a visible
  endometrium - with phases that vary during the cycle.

The Ovaries - Changes During Life

Just like with the uterus, infants tend to have larger ovaries (volume around I cc), which then
decrease and remain around or less than 1 cc until about age 6. The ovaries then gradually
increase to normal adult size as puberty approaches and occurs.

The quick and dirty o f it is that the
mullerian ducts make the uterus and
upper 2/3 o f the vagina.

The urogenital sinus grows up to meet
the mullerian ducts and makes the
bottom 1/3 o f the vagina.

Wolffian ducts are the boy parts, and
should regress completely in girls.

My idea for teaching this somewhat confusing topic is to tap into the thought process o f
embryology to help understand why anomalies happen, and why they happen together. The
embryology I'm about to discuss is not strict and doesn't use all the fancy French / Latin
words. It's more concept related ...

right.

So there are 3 main ways this whole process can get screwed up.

(1) You can have only soup on one side. This is a "failure to form " As you can imagine,
     if you don't have the soup on one side you d o n 't have a kidney on that side. You also
     don't have h alf o f your uterus. This is w hy a unilateral absent kidney is associated with
     Unicomuate Uterus (+/- rudimentary horn).

(2) As the soup gets poured down it can fail to fuse completely. This can be on the
     spectrum of mostly not fiised - basically separate (Uterus Didelphys) or mostly fused
     except the top part - so it looks like a heart (Bicomuate). Because the Bicomuate and
     Didelphys are related pathologies - they both get vaginal septa (Didelphys more often
     than Bicom uate - easily rem em bered because it's a m ore severe fusion anomaly).

(3) The clean up operation can be done sloppy ("failure to cleave"). The classic example
     o f this is a "Septate uterus," where a septum remains between the two uterine cavities.

Unicomuate Uterus - The unicomuate uterus can be subdivided into 4 variants.

Unicomuate +           Unicomuate +      f Unicomuate +                   Isolated
Communicating          Non-                                               Unicomuate

If you see a unicomuate utems the classic teaching is to look for a mdimentary horn. The reason is the
rudimentary homs can have endometrium - and if present can cause lots of phantom female belly pain
problems (dysmenorrhea, hematometra, hematosalpinx, etc..., etc..., so on a so forth). Endometrial tissue
in a rudimentary hom (communicating or not) - increases the risk of miscarriage. An additional problem
could be a pregnancy in the rudimentary hom - in both the communicating and noncommunicating types-
although especially bad in the non-communicating sub-type because it nearly always results in
mdimentary hom mpture (life-threatening bleeding).

Renal agenesis contralateral to the main uterine hom (ipsilateral to the rudimentary horn) is the most
common abnormality.

Hysterosalpingogram (HSG)

HSGs are most typically done as part of an infertility workup,              N drm al
although it can also be used to make sure a tubal ligation or
obstruction procedure worked. The idea is that you squirt contrast             0-7 "Rag Week"
into the uterus to (1) visualize a normal uterine cavity and (2) make        7-14 Proliferative,
sure the tubes are patent. Evaluation o f uterine bleeding should be
done with ultrasound or in some cases MRI. Bicomuate vs Septate is             14-28 Secretory

outer fundal contour - otherwise you could totally get uterine
malformation cases - as previously discussed..

Technique: Study is best performed during the proliferative phase (day
7-12), when the endometrium is the thinnest and makes pregnancy the
least likely. A catheter (usually 5F) is positioned in the cervical canal
and a balloon is inflated to allow for contrast instillation. WATER-
SOLUBLE contrast (never barium) is slowly squirted into the uterus.
The normal exam will show a normal uterine contour and free
intraperitoneal spillage of contrast (this proves the tubes are patent).

Contraindications: (1) Pregnancy, (2) Active Pelvic Infection, (3) Active bleeding ("rag week" /
"moon blood"), (4) Contrast Allergy

Irregular Filling Defects: The most common cause is synechiae / scarring / intrauterine
adhesions usually secondary to trauma from prior curettage. Endometrial infections (secondary
to the behaviors of questionable moral conduct and/or being a "free spirit") are also classically
implicated. The look is irregular, often linear, filling defects arising from one of the uterine
walls. When the scars / adhesions cause clinical infertility then you get to deploy the term
"Asherman syndrome." -- see the
next page.

Round / Oval Filling Defects:                      Polyp                    Bubbles
Endometrial polyps or Fibroids can
both look like round / oval filling
defects that are best seen during the
early filling stage. Fibroids be BIG
and totally distort the internal
contour. Bubbles may also appear as
round filling defects but they should
be mobile and transient.

Tubal Occlusion: Infection / PID
(secondary to questionable moral
standards and/or being a "free spirif')
is the most common cause.
