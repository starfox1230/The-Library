                               T hyroid

Anatomy: The thyroid gland is a butterfly shaped gland, with two lobes connected by an
isthmus. The thyroid descends from the foramen cecum at the anterior midline base o f the
tongue along the thyroglossal duct. The posterior nodular extension o f the thyroid (Zuckerkandl
tubercle) helps with locating the recurrent laryngeal nerve (which is medial to it).

Thyroid Nodules: Usually evaluated with ultrasound. Nodules are super super common and
almost never cancer. This doesn't stop Radiologists from imaging them, and sticking needles
into them. Ultrasound guided FNA o f colloid nodules is a major cash cow for many body
divisions, that on very rare occasions will actually find a cancer. Qualities that make them more
suspicious include: more solid (cystic more benign), calcifications (especially
microcalcifications). Microcalcifications are supposed to be the buzzword for papillary
thyroid cancer. "Comet Tail" artifact is seen in Colloid Nodules. "Cold Nodules" on 1-123
scans are still usually benign but have cancer about 15% o f the time, so they actually deserve
workup.

Colloid Nodules: These are super super common. Suspicious features include
microcalcifications, increased vascularity, solid, size (larger than 1.5 cm), and being cold on a
nuclear uptake exam. As above, Comet tail artifact is the buzzword.

Thyroid Adenoma: These look just like solid colloid nodules on ultrasound. They can be hyper
functioning (hot on uptake scan). Usually if you have a hyper-functioning nodule (toxic adenoma),
your background thyroid will be colder than normal (which makes sense).

Goiter - Thyroid that is too big. In North America it's gonna be a multi-nodular goiter or Graves.
In Africa it's low iodine. You can get compressive symptoms if it mashes the esophagus or trachea.
These are often asymmetric - with one lobe bigger than the other.

Subacute Thyroiditis I De Quervains Thyroiditis: The classic clinical scenario is a
female with a painful gland after an upper respiratory infection. There is a similar subtype that
happens in pregnant women, although this is typically painless. You get hyperthyroidism (from
spilling the hormone) and then later hypothyroidism. As you get over your cold, the gland recovers to
normal function. Radiotracer uptake will be decreased during the acute phase.

Acute Suppurative Thyroiditis: This is an actual bacterial infection of the thyroid. It is
possible to develop a thyroid abscess in this situation. A unique scenario (highly testable) is that in
kids this infection may start in a 4`'>branchial cleft anomaly (usually on the left), travel via a
pyriform fistula and then infect the thyroid. Honestly, that is probably too much for the exam - but
could show up on a certification exam under neuro.

Reideis Thyroiditis; This is one of those IgG4 associated diseases (others include orbital
pseudotumor, retroperitoneal fibrosis, sclerosing cholangitis). You see it in women in their 40s-70s.
The thyroid is replaced by fibrous tissue and diffusely enlarges causing compression of adjacent
structures (dysphagia, stridor, vocal cord palsy). On US there will be decreased vascularity. On an
uptake scan you are going to have decreased values. A sneak trick would be to show you a MR (it's
gonna be dark on all sequences - like a fibroma).

Thyrogiossai Duct Cyst (TGDC): The                         TGDC - Location Fuckery
most common congenital neck cyst in Pediatrics.
This can occur anywhere between the foramen          These are the general numbers to think
cecum (the base of the tongue) and the thyroid       about:
gland (or below). It looks like a thin walled cyst.
                                                     Suprahyoid = 25%
Why Care?                                            At the Hyoid = 30%
톂hey can get infected                               Infrahyoid = 45%
톂hey can have ectopic thyroid tissue
톀arely, that ectopic tissue can get papillary       So, where is the most common location?
thyroid cancer (if you see an enhancing nodule)
                                                     Well, it depends on how they ask. If all
                                                     things are equal the answer is Infrahyoid
                                                     (which seems counterintuitive based on the
                                                     embryology but is nonetheless true).

                                                     BUT - if "at or above the hyoid" is a choice
                                                     - then that is actually the right answer
                                                     (25+30 > 45). As always, read every choice.

Ectopic and Lingual Thyroid: Similar to a thyrogiossai duct cyst, this can be found
anywhere from the base of the tongue through the central neck. The most common location (90%)
is the tongue base ("Lingual Thyroid"). It will look hyperdense because of its iodine content (just
like a normally located thyroid gland). If you find this, make sure you check for a normal thyroid
(sometimes this is the only thyroid the dude has). As a point of trivia, the rate of malignant
transformation is rare (3%).

                                                             485
Graves - Autoim m une disease that causes hyperthyroidism (m ost com mon cause). It's
prim arily from an antibody directed at the TSH receptor. The actual TSH level will be low.
The gland will be enlarged and "inferno hot" on Doppler.
* Graves Orbitopathy. Spares the tendon insertions, doesn't hurt (unlike pseudotumor).

     Also has increased intra-orbital fat.
* Nuclear M edicine: Increased uptake o f 1-123 % RAIU usually 50-80%. Visualization o f

     pyramidal lobe is accentuated.

Hashimotos - The most com m on cause o f goitrous hypothyroidism (in the US). It is
an autoimmune disease that causes hyper then hypo thyroidism (as the gland bums out later).
It's usually hypo - when it's seen. It has an increased risk o f prim ary thyroid lymphoma.
Step 1 trivia; associated with autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and anti-
thyroglobulin.
On Ultrasound.
There are two classic findings:
(a) Heterogeneous "giraffe sldn" appearance,

(b) White Knights - uniform hyperechoic nodules -
     which are actually regenerative nodules.

                                                                                                White Knight

                             Level 6 Nodes - "Delphian Nodes"
     These are the nodes around the thyroid in the front o f the neck.
     You can commonly see them enlarged with Hashimotos.
     However, for the purpose o f multiple choice tests, a sick looking level 6 node - or
     "Delphian Node" is a laryngeal cancer met.

                                                              486
Thyroid Cancer: You can get lots o f cancers in your thyroid. There are 4 m ain subtypes
of primary thyroid cancer. Additionally you can get mets to the thyroid or lymphoma in your
thyroid - this is super rare and I 'm not going to talk about it.

Papillary   The Most Common         Microcalcifications is  Mets via the
Follicular  Subtype. "Papillary is  the buzzword and        lymphatics. Has an
            Popular"                key finding (seen in    overall excellent

Metastasis: The buzzw ord is going to be m icrocalcifications in a node (with papillary).
The nodes are typically hyperechoic compared to regular nodes, hyperenhancing on CT, and
T1 bright on MR. Rem em ber that thyroid cancer is hypervascular, and it can bleed like stink
when it mets to the brain. If there are mets to the lungs, the classic pattern is "miliary." The
additional pearl with regard to lung mets is that they can be occult on cross sectional imaging,
and only seen on whole body scintigraphy. For the purpose o f multiple choice tests pulmonary
fibrosis is a risk o f treating with 1-131 i f yo u have diffuse lung mets.
