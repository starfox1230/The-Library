Brain Myelination:

The baby brain has essentially the opposite signal characteristics as the adult brain. The T1 pattern
of a baby is similar to the T2 pattern of an adult. The T2 pattern o f a baby is similar to the T i
pattern o f an adult. This appearance is the result o f myelination changes.

The process o f myelination occurs in a predetermined order, and      Immature        Mature
therefore lends itself easily to multiple choice testing. The basic     Myelin        Myelin
concept to understand first is that immature myelin has a higher
water content relative to mature myelin and therefore is brighter    High Water,  Low Water,
on T2 and darker on T l. During the maturation process, water        Low Fat      High Fat
will decrease and fat (brain cholesterol and glycolipids) will
increase. Therefore mature white matter will be brighter on Tl       Tl dark.     Tl bright,
and darker on T2.                                                    T2 bright    T2 dark

Testable Trivia: the T l changes precede the T2 changes (adult T l pattern seen around age 1, adult T2
pattern seen around age 2). Should be easy to remember (1 fo r Tl, 2 fo r T2).

Take Home Point: T l is most useful for assessing myelination in the first year (especially 0-6
months), T2 is most useful for assessing myelination in the second year (especially 6 months to 18
months).

Order o fprogression: Just remember,    Brain Myelination Pattern
inferior to superior, posterior to
anterior, central to peripheral, and       Inferior to Superior, Posterior to Anterior
sensory fibers prior to motor fibers.
The testable trivia is that the
subcortical white matter is the last
part of the brain to myelinate, with
the occipital white matter around 12
months, and the frontal regions
finishing around 18 months. The
"terminal zones" o f myelination occur
in the subcortical
frontotemporoparietal regions -
finishing around 40 months.

Another high yield piece o f testable trivia is that the brainstem, and posterior limb of the internal
capsule are normally myelinated at birth.

Congenital Malformations:

This is a very confusing and complicated topic, full o f long Latin and French sounding words.
If we want to keep it simple and somewhat high yield you can look at it in 5 basic categories:
(1) Failure to Form, (2) Failure to Cleave, (3) Failure to M igrate, (4) Developm ent Failure
Mimics, and (5) Flemiation Syndromes.

Failure to Form - Dysgenesis / Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum                 Splenium
A classic point o f trivia is that the corpus
callosum forms front to back
(then rostrum last).

Therefore hypoplasia o f the corpus
callosum is usually absence o f the
splenium (with the genu intact).

                                                With agenesis o f the corpus callosum, a common
                                                trick is to show colpocephaly (asymmetric dilation
                                                of the occipital hems).

Failure to Form - Associations - Intracranial Lipoma

Dysgenesis / Agenesis o f the Corpus Callosum is associated with lots o f other syndromes/
malformations (Lipoma, Heterotopias, Schizencephaly, Lissencephaly, etc...). Some sources
will even say it is the "most common anomaly seen with other CNS malformations. " --
whatever the fiack that means.

Gamesmanship: This stuff is tricky. Let me suggest the following tactics.

If you are faced with this level of trivia (on an intermediate level exam), first start by looking for
the two markers of normal vermian development: (1) the primary fissure and (2) fastigial point -
both of which are best seen mid sagittal. The "fastigial point" is normal angular contour (not
round) along the ventral surface of the cerebellum. The primary cerebellarfissure is a deep
trapezoid shaped cleft along the posterior cerebellum. Absence or abnormal morphology of these

landmarks should trigger a multiple choice brain reflex indicating the vermis is not nonnal.

Failure to Form - DanflvWalRer and Friends

Radiologists love to nitpick and obsess over details. The more meaningless the details the more
intense and emotional the debate. Along those lines, Dandy Walker malformations are typically
described along a spectrum. The arbitrary stops along this spectrum often lead to ferocious beta
male nerd confrontations amongst Academics - filled with ferocious exchanges of
gossip, innuendo, finger nail scratching / pinching, biting, hair pulling, and empty threats of
reputation destruction.

Despite the very real threat of being scratched and pinched by an enraged Academic
- 1 now offer my simplified strategy for dealing with this complex pathology.

- it's the expanded 4th ventricle).

The cerebellar hemispheres will be displaced forward
and laterally but their overall volume and morphologic
characteristics should be preserved.

"TORCULAR-LAMBDOID INVERSION"

This classic buzzword(s) describes the torcula
{confluence o f venous sinuses) above the level of the
lambdoid suture, secondary to elevation of the tentorium.

It's worth mentioning that this inversion is often NOT        -N orm al-      - Dandy W alker-

Failure to Form - Dandy walker and Friends

As I mentioned on the prior page, Dandy Walker malformations are typically described along a
spectrum. We covered the `"classic" subtype in depth on the prior page. The stragglers (presumed to
be of lower yield) and classic type are contrasted on the chart below.

Remember, that to call it "classic" you need all the features. If the vermis is hypoplastic and rotated
- but there is no torcular-lambdoid inversion you are dealing with a variant. To fuck with you they
could just say "hypoplastic rotated vermis" - but without the other features you can't call it a true
classic DWM.

Failure to Cleave - Holoprosencephaly ( HPE)

This entity also occurs along a spectrum with the common theme being some element of abnormal
central fusion. Although, it isn't actually a fusion problem. Instead, it is a failure to perform the
normal midline cleaving. In the normal embryology, the fancy latin word "P-lon " starts out like a
peanut butter sandwich, then mom cuts the bread into two perfect halves (separate lateral
hemispheres). The sandwich cutting (cleavage) always occurs back to front (opposite of the
formation of the corpus callosum), so in milder forms the posterior cortex is normal and the anterior
cortex is fused.

Anytime I read embryology I can't help but think of her and wonder "can anyone
who loves animals so much, really be crazy?" The answer to that... is yes.
Yes they can. They can be a drunken lunatic. So much so, that I was convinced
that anyone who understood embryology risked ending up just like her.

A -A PKOM£TH£XN D IX Lo q u e ON COKTICXL FOK.MXTION -

Prologue: The brain is said to form "inside-out, " as neurons that will eventually make up the cortex
are originally birthed from a thick slurry surrounding the fetal ventricles. Sleep inducing texts will
refer to this as the "proliferative neuroepithelium." I prefer the tenn "Lazarus Pit," or just the "Pit."
It is from this Periventricular Pit, where cells will make "the climb" to the cortex.

Act 1 - Proliferation: Before making "the climb" to the cortex the neuronal-glial stem cells are
bom into (and molded by) the darkness of the periventricular Lazarus Pit. It is there that they learn
the truth about despair, first by dividing into additional stem cells in a symmetric fashion (1 stem cell
splits into 2 stem cells). Later this process will change to asymmetric proliferation (1 stem cell splits
into 1 stem cell and 1 differentiated cell - glial cell or neuron). This process continues for several

The number of neurons in the cortex is determined by the frequency and                  _ @
number of symmetric / asymmetric divisions by these stem cells.
Disturbance in this process will therefore result in either too many, too  Symmetric Asymmetric
few, or improperly differentiated neurons.

Act 2 - Migration (RISE): From the periventricular proliferative pit of despair, cells will make the
climb. As they climb to freedom, they are guided by structural cells, chemical signals, and the chant
"Deshi, Deshi, Basara, Basara." They make the climb in 6 waves, with the first generation forming
the "pre-plate" and the second generation forming the more permanent "cortical plate."

In other words, the younger cells always moving past the older ones
becoming more superficial in their final position, (hence the idea -
"inside out" or "outside last"). Disturbance in this mechanism
(guidance, timing of detachment etc...) will result in under­
migration, over-migration, or ectopic neurons.

Act 3 - Organization: At this point you may think the cells have given
everything to the cortex, and they don't owe them anymore. But, they haven't
given everything... not yet. There is still the process of cortical folding
(gyrification).

The process actually occurs simultaneously with and depends heavily on the first two steps. The
differential speed of cortex expansion (relative to the deeper white matter) is probably the key
mechanism for brain folding. For this expansion to occur properly there needs to be the right
number of cells (act 1) migrated in the right order (act 2). There is the additional mechanism of
continued differentiation into structural cell types which organize into horizontal / vertical columns
creating an underlying cytoarchitecture need for structure and function. Disturbance in these
mechanisms will result in an absence of or excessive number of folds.

   Failure to Migrate / Proliferate: Lissencephaly-Pachygyria Spectrum and Friends

Now, we are going to discuss the testable pathologies associated with how this process can fuck up.

I'm going to try and group them according to the stage of disturbance (although they don't always fit
nicely into a single stage).

Failure to Proliferate: Heoiimegaleocephaly:

Rare, but unique (Aunt Minnie), malformation characterized by enlargement (from hamartomatous
overgrowth) of all or part/s of one cerebral hemisphere. The presumed cause is a failure in the
normal neuronal differentiation in the involved hemisphere - resulting in an "abnormal mixture of
normal tissues" - which defines a hamartoma. This process is often mixed with other errors in
migration resulting in associated polymicrogyria, pachygyria, and heterotopia.

The combo of (1) dilated ventricle and (2) mismatched hemisphere size can be confused with
destructive pathologies. So lets do a quick comparison to negate any potential fuckery.

                                            The trick is to look at which side the dilated ventricle is on.

                       migration failure.

Since literally anything is fair game on this exam. I'm including it for completeness
(it's probably low yield).

Failure to Organize; Poiymicrogyria "PMC''

I've heard people blame this on TORCH infections, toxic exposure, chromosomal issues, God's wrath
for "stuff the Democrats do." There are likely many causes. I wouldn't expect someone to ask for
"the cause," other than perhaps the broad category of failed organization.

Having said that, I've read some PhD papers saying that layer 5
gets obliterated (by infection, toxins, wrath, etc..) after
completion of normal migration. With layer 5 gone the other
more superficial layers overfold and fuse resulting in an excessive
number of small folds - the hallmark finding.

This anomaly come in a variety of shapes and sizes
(unilateral, bilateral, small, large, symmetric or asymmetric).
Most common location is adjacent to the Sylvian fissure
bilaterally.

Failure to Organize: Sciiizencephaly-- "Split Brain"

Just like poiymicrogyria there are likely many causes and I wouldn't expect someone to ask for "the
cause," other than perhaps the broad category of failed organization.

Having said that, one popular theory is the idea of a vascular insult. What is this vascular insult ?
Well, you could say it's the cortex's reckoning (it damages the radial glial fibers). These radial glial
fibers are in charge (or at least they "feel in charge") of the ropes used by neurons to "make the
climb." Although, I've heard it's best to make the climb as the child did - without the rope. I mention
this because about 30% of patient's with schizencephaly also have non-CNS vascular stigmata
(example = gastroschisis - which supposedly occurs from a vascular insult to the abdominal wall).

Classic Look: Schizencephaly literally means "split brain" with the defining feature being a cleft
(lined with grey matter) connecting the CSF spaces with the ventricular system. How wide this cleft is
depends on the flavor; Closed Lip (20%) or (2) Open Lip (80%), although in both cases the cleft
should span the fiill thickness of the involved hemisphere. The clefts can be unilateral or bilateral.

Closed Lip (20%) - Less Common, Less Severe       jOpen Lip (80%) More Common, More Severe

 or grey matter running                                                          (lined with grey matter)

Sometimes you can see a "nipple" of grey mater
pouching at the ependymal (ventricular) surface.  IThe gray matter lining is often weird looking
                                                  i(kinda nodular like a heterotopia).

This topic is incredibly complicated. There are literally entire books written on the individual
subtypes. The following is my best effort to distill the potentially testable trivia down to about 1.5
pages.

There are several numbered sub-types of Chiari malformations, with the shared finding of a
downward displacement of the cerebellum. Here is a quick overview of the subtypes.
