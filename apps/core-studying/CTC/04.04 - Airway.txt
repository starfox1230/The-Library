                                    A irw ay

Croup

This is the most common cause o f acute upper airway obstruction in young children. The
peak incidence is between 6 months and 3 years (average 1 year). They have a barky
"croupy" cough. It's viral. The thing to reahze is that the lateral and frontal neck x-ray is
done not to diagnosis croup, but to exclude something else. Having said that, the so-called
"steeple sign " - with loss o f the normal lateral convexities o f the subglottic trachea is your
buzzword, and if it's shown, that will be the finding. Questions are still more likely to center
around facts (age and etiology). The culprit is often parainfluenza virus.

Epiglottitis

In contrast to the self-limited croup, this one can kill you. It's m ediated by H. Influenza and
the classic age is 3.5 years old (there is a recent increase in teenagers - so don't be fooled by
that age). The lateral x-ray will show marked swelling o f the epiglottis {thumb sign). A fake
out is the "om ega epiglottis" which is caused by oblique imaging. You can look for thickening
of the aryepiglottic folds to distinguish.

Trivia: Death by asphyxiation is from the aryepiglotic folds (not the epiglottis)

Exudative Tracheitis (Bacterial Tracheitis)

This is an uncom m on but serious (possibly deadly) situation that is found in slightly older
kids. It's caused by an exudative infection o f the trachea (sorta like diptheria). It's usually
from Staph A. and affects kids between 6-10. The buzzw ord is linear soft tissue fillin g defect
within the airway.

Retropharyngeal Cellulitis and Abscess

Discussed in detail in the Neuro chapter o f Volume 2. I'll just say quickly that you do see this
most commonly in young kids (age 6 months -12 months). If they don't show it on CT, they
could show it with a lateral x-ray demonstrating massive retropharyngeal soft tissue
thickening. For the real world, you can get pseudothickening when the neck is not truly lateral.
To tell the difference between positioning and the real thing, a repeat with an extended neck is
the next step.

Subglottic Hemangioma                                                    PHACES

Hemangiomas are the most common soft tissue mass in the        P- Posterior fossa
trachea, and they are most commonly located in the subglottic  (Dandy Walker)
region. In croup there is symmetric narrowing with loss o f    H- Hemangiomas
shoulders on both sides (Steeple Sign). In contradistinction,  A- Arterial anomalies
subglottic hemangiomas have loss of just one o f the sides.    C- Coarctation o f aorta,
                                                               cardiac defects

More on hemangiomas later in the chapter.

            Laryngeal Cleft

This is a zebra. The classic scenario is contrast appearing in the tracheal without laryngeal penetration
(aspiration). They could also show you a "thin tract of contrast extending to the larynx or trachea." This
entity is a communicating defect in the posterior wall of the larynx and the esophagus or anterior hypo
pharynx. There are a bunch of different cleft classifications - 1 can't imagine that shit is appropriate for
the exam. I would just know:

 This is a thing - maybe google a Fluoro swallow picture of it
 These things have other complex malformations associated with them (usually GI)
 It is very tricky to call it with certainty on a swallow exam - definite diagnosis is always made with

  direct visualization / scope (so a next step type question would recommend endoscopy to confirm).

Tracheoesophageal Fistula - This is discussed later in the chapter (GI section)

Papilloma - If you see a lobulated grape looking thing in the airway - think Papilloma, especially if
the lungs are full of nodules (solid and cavitated). When I say Papilloma, You say HPV - typically from
perinatal (birth canal) transmission. These things are usually multiple (papillomatosis) and therefore have
multiple areas of airspace disease (atelectasis ect.). Some potential gamesmanship -- because these thing
are typically multiple you will have more areas of air trapping then you would compared with an
aspirated crayon (or green bean), or even a solitary endobronchial lesion like a carcinoid. Multiple areas
of air trapping - think Papillomatosis over carcinoid or a foreign body. Having said that the nodules are a
more common finding... lots of them.

Frontal and Lateral Neck Radiographs

For the frontal, there are
two main things to think
about.

(1) Croup and
(2) Subglottic

     Hemangioma

You can tell them apart by
the shouldering.

If you can't tell.... try and
let the history bias you.
Cough? Fever? Think
Croup.

For the lateral, there are 4 main things to think about:

    Epiglottitis        Retropharyngeal         Tonsils (adenoids)           Exudative
                              Abscess                                        Tracheitis
