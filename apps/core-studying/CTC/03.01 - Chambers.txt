Eustachian Valve:
Another normal anatomic structure that
can be shown is the IVC valve or
Eustachian valve (arrow). It looks like a
little flap in the IVC as it hooks up to the
atrium. When the tissue of this valve has
a more trabeculated appearance it is called
a Chiari Network.

for the moderator band.

What does it mean to be samurai ?
To devote yourself utterly to a set o f moral principles. To seek a stillness
o f your mind. And to master the way o f the sword.

The Chamber of Secrets

Remember that most academics disdain Muggle-bom wizards, believing pure-bloods are superior.
This is their motivation for showing cardiac MRI cases. They know community trained muggles
don't get exposed to this stuff. Don't allow yourself to be petrified, if cardiac MRI questions are
determining if you pass or not - than in the immortal words of Kurt Osiander. "you fucked up a long
time ago."

Cardiac MRI always starts with a series of localizer images (non-gated, wide field of view) which
will cover the entire heart. The "standard views" are then selected from this data - typically in
diastole.

The 2 Chamber:                                                                                 Coronary
                                                                                               Sinus
If you want to get fancy this is a "two chamber
long axis single obhque." This view resembles                                        Papillary
a "basilisk fang" and is obtained from a                                             Muscle
bisection of the LV, parallel to the IV septum
(by using that localizer scout).                                               = Mitral Valve

This displays the LV and LA (2 chambers).
This is good for a few things (1) Wall motion / Global LV function
(especially motion o f the inferior an d anterior walls) and (2)
Mitral valve issues - regurg, etc. The anatomy trick would be to
have you ID the coronary sinus on this view.

                                           117
The 4 Chamber Long Axis:

If you want to get fancy this is a "four chamber
horizontal long axis." This view lays out the
ventricular septum like the "Sword of Godric
Gryffmdor" and is obtained from a plane parallel to
the long axis of the LA and the LV (by using that 2
chamber view).

This displays the LV, LA, RV, and RA (4 chambers).                                  = Mitral Valve
                                                                                ^ = Tricuspid Valve
Classic Trivia: The Horizontal Long Axis (4 chamber view)                       ^ = Triforce of Power
                    allows assessment of both the mitral and tricuspid valves.

Classic Trivia: This view is not great for looking at many congenital heart problems.
                    The notable (testable) exception to this is
                    the AV canal defect which is seen best on this view (arrow).

The LV Short Axis:                                                                        Papillary
                                                                                          Muscles
This is a "down the barrel o f polyjuice
potion" series of views taken
perpendicular to the long axis of the heart.

We can use the 4 chamber long axis to
obtain these views.

Classic Trivia: The short axis view is
obtained perpendicular to the 4 chamber
horizontal long axis

The 3 Chamber:

Some people will call this an "apical
long axis view." It is obtained by using
a short axis view around the mid-base
region near the aortic outflow tract.

This is the "filthy mud blood" view - an impure hybrid between
the 4 and the 2. The testable advantage is the visualization of the
the left ventricular outflow tract (LVQT). - and is ideal for
looking at flow through this area (i.e. aortic regurg).

A way a question could be asked is "what view is best for aortic
regurg? / stenosis?" or "which of the following views" - and make
you pick out the picture of the 3 chamber. Or just straight ask you - what is this view?

                                                                 118
Chamber Enlargement

There are described patterns of chamber enlargement on CXR. These are testable and in most cases
total bullshit - but they are worth going over (games are best played as games).

observation seen on pre-natal
ultrasound. It is a calcified
papillary muscle that usually
goes away by the third
trimester. So who gives a shit?
Well they are associated with

Downs (13%).

Don't get it twisted, having one  Echogenic Focus in Left Ventricle
means nothing other than you
should look for other signs of
Downs (most o f the time it's
normal).

Lipomatous Hypertrophy of the Interatrial Septum:

This has a very classic look of a dumbbell (bilobed) appearance of fat density in the atrial septum,
sparing the fossa ovalis. This sparing of the fossa ovalis, creates a dumbbell appearance {when it
doesn't spare it think lipoma). It's associated with being fat, old, and going to yard sales to argue over
the price of broken fumiture and used socks.

Trivia: It can cause supraventricular arrhythmia, although usually does nothing.

Trivia: It can be hot on PET because it's often made of brown fat.
