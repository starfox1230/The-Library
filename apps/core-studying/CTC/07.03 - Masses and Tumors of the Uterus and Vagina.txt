                               OF THE UTERUS AND VAGINA

Fibroids (Uterine Leiomyoma): These benign smooth muscle tumors are the most common
uterine mass. They are more common in women of African ancestry. They hke estrogen and are most
common in reproductive age (rare in prepubertal females). Because of this estrogen relationship
they tend to grow rapidly during pregnancy, and involute with menopause. Their location is
classically described as submucosal (least common), intramural (most common), or subserosal.

Typical Appearance: The general rule is they can look like anything. Having said that, they are
usually hypoechoic on ultrasound, often with peripheral blood flow and shadowing in the so called
"Venetian Blind" pattern. On CT, they often have peripheral calcifications ("popcorn" as seen on
plain film). On MRJ, T1 dark (to intermediate), T2 dark, and variable enhancement. The fibroids
with higher T2 signal are said to respond better to IR treatment. A variant subtype is the
lipoleiomyoma, which is fat containing.

Degeneration: 4 types of degeneration are generally described. What they have in common is a lack
of / paucity of enhancement (fibroids normally enhance avidly). The process of degeneration (basically
a fibroid stroke) can cause severe pain as well as fever and/or leukocytosis.

           -Endometrium-Normal and Abnormal Thickening-

Normal: Later in the chapter we will discuss how the normal hormonal fluctuations change the
appearance of the ovaries. This also happens with the uterus - and lends itself easily to multiple
choice questions. So let us take a quick look at this:

                                                                     Is itfrom atrophy or cancer?
because the patient is having abnormal bleeding. The cause of
this bleeding is your job as a radiologist to figure out (or at   ·Endometrium less than 5 mm =

atrophy and cancer is easily solved with an ultrasound 

· Focal or generalized thickening in post menopausal women
  greater than 5mm should get sampled.

· Premenopausal endometriums can get very thick - up to 20mm can be normal.

Trivia:
· Estrogen secreting tumors - Granulosa Cell tumors of the ovary will thicken the endometrium.
· Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (HNPCC) - 30-50x increased risk of endometrial CA

Endometrial Cancer: Basically all uterine cancers are adenocarcinoma (90%+). The only
possible exception for the purpose of multiple choice would be the rare "leiomyosarcoma" - which looks
like a giant fucking fibroid, as discussed on the prior page.

Typical Scenario: A postmenopausal patient (60s) with bleeding.          First Step Postmenopausal
Ultrasound shows an endometrium that is too thick (most people               Bleeder = Ultrasound
say 4- 5mm) then it gets a biopsy. Almost always this will be
stage 1 disease, and no further imaging will be done.                 Too Thick ( > 4-5mm) ? = Biopsy
Occasionally extent of disease will be staged with MRI (not CT -      Extent of Local Disease = MRI
which is dog shit for looking at the cervix).

Endometrial C an ce r - Part 2 - MRI Staging Trivia                              Key MRI Findings
                                                                                   (Most Likely Tested)
MRI is used for assessing myometrial invasion depth and cervical
involvement. To make these findings you will need to understand how           For Endometrial Cancer
these studies are done and how they can show this to you.
There are 3 basic sequences you need to know.                                 (1) Myometrial Invasion:
                                                                              less or greater than half?
(1) Diffusion - the tumor will restrict, and it is most hkely to be shown on
     ADC (remember that true restricted diffusion has low ADC). Diffusion     (2) Cervical Stromal
     is good for "Drop mets" into the vagina, and finding lymph nodes.        Invasion.

(2) T2 - Both T2 and Post Contrast T1 can be shown in                         Axial Oblique
     sagittal or the axial oblique. The axial oblique is
     obtained from images perpendicular (solid lines) to the
     long axis of the endometrial cavity (dotted line).
     Tumor on T2 tends to be intermediate signal - brighter
     than the adjacent dark junctional zone.

(3) Post Contrast T l: As above this can be shown in sagittal or axial oblique. The myometrium should
     enhance fairly homogeneously. The tumor will actually be the thing that enhances LESS than the
     adjacent myometrium (normally you think about cancer enhancing more than nearby tissue).

Cancer - Part 3 - More Staging Trivia

· Moving from stage lA (<50% myometrium) to stage IB (>50% of the myometrium) increases the risk
  of lymph node disease.

· Some sites will do lymph node sample at stage lA, and radical lymph node dissection at stage IB.

· You will often hear people say that "extension of the tumor into the myometrium is the single most
  important morphologic prognostic factor"

· Stage 2 disease is defined as cervical stroma
  invasion. This also increases the risk for lymph node
  mets.

· The diagnostic key is the post contrast imaging
  (obtained 2-3 mins after injection). If the cervical
  mucosa enhances normally, you have excluded
  stromal invasion.

· You have to wait 2-3 mins after injection because the              Stage 1:             Stage 2:
  normal cervix doesn't enhance symmetrically (the       T1+C: Normal dark            Tl+C: Tumor

· Stage 2 is probably going to change management by      invasion.
  adding pre-op radiation to the cervix, plus a change
  from TAH to radical hysterectomy (obviously this
  varies from center to center).

Tamoxifen Changes: This is a SERM (acts like estrogen in the
pelvis, blocks the estrogen effects on the breast). It's used for breast
cancer, but marginally increases the risk of endometrial cancer (1% per
year). It will cause subendometrial cysts, and the development of
endometrial polyps (30%). Normally, post menopausal endometrial
tissue shouldn't be thicker than 4mm, but on Tamoxifen the endometrium
is often thick (some papers say the mean is 12 mm at 5 years).

When do you biopsy? If post menopausal and bleeding. If the patient is
not symptomatic there is no routine screening and no role for ultrasound.

Gamesmanship: An easy way to test this is by showing you classic
tamoxifen changes (as above) and making you guess the history of breast cancer.

Endometrial Polyps: These things cause bleeding and can mimic a thickened endometrium.

The typical look is a solitary bright (hyperechoic) lesion, sometimes shown with a single vessel feeding it
on doppler imaging. The classic way this is tested is to get you to ask for (or just show you) an
ultrasound with saline infused into the uterus (sonohysterography).

Cervical Cancer-

It's usually squam ous cell, related to H PV (like 90%). The big thing to know is param etrial
invasion (stage lib). Stage Ila or below is treated with surgery. Once you have parametrial
invasion (stage Ilb), or involvem ent o f the lower 1/3 o f the vagina it's gonna get chem o/

Why is it so important ?The uterine artery

runs inside the parametrium, hence the need
for chemo - once invaded.

How do you tell if it's invaded ? Normally the cervix has a T2 dark ring. That thing

should be intact. If the tumor goes through that thing, you gotta call it invaded.

Endometrial Fluid - In premenopausal women this is a common finding. In postmenopausal
women it means either cervical stenosis or an obstructing mass (usually cervical stenosis).

Solid Vaginal Masses:

An uninvited solid vaginal mass is usually a bad thing. It can be secondary (cervical or
uterine carcinoma protruding into the vagina), or primary such as a clear cell adenocarcinoma
or rhabdomyosarcoma.
Leiomyoma - Rare in the vagina, but can occur (most commonly in the anterior wall).
Squamous Cell Carcinom a - The m ost com mon cancer o f the vagina (85%). This is
associated with HPV. This is just like the cervix.
Clear Cell Adenocarcinoma - This is the zebra cancer seen in women whose mothers took
DBS (a synthetic estrogen thought to prevent miscarriage). That plus "T-Shaped U terus" is
probably all you need to know.
Vaginal Rhabdomyosarcoma - This is the most common tumor o f the vagina in children.
There is a bim odal age distribution in ages (2-6, and 14-18). They usually come o ff the
anterior wall near the cervix. It can occur in the uterus, but typically invades it secondarily.
Think about this when you see a solid T2 bright enhancing mass in the vagina / lower uterus
in a child.

Cystic Vaginal I Cervical Masses:

Nabothian Cysts - These are usually on the cervix and you see them all the time. They are

the result o f inflammation causing epithelium plugging o f mucous glands.

Gartner Ducts Cysts - These are the result o f incom plete regression o f the W olffian ducts.

They are classically located along the anterior lateral wall o f the upper vagina. If they are
located at the level o f the urethra, that can cause mass effect on the urethra (and
symptoms).

Bartholin Cysts - These are the result o f obstruction o f the Bartholin glands (mucin-

secreting glands from the urogenital sinus). They are found below the pubic symphysis
(helps distinguish them from Gartner duct). Treatment -- usually nothing, but if they get
infected or cause pain (or mess up your "only fans" donations) they can be dealt with via
marsupialization (basically sutured open to allow for continual drainage).

Skene Gland Cysts - Cysts in these periurethral glands, can cause recurrent UTIs and

urethral obstruction.
