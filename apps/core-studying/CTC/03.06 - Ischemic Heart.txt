-                         ISCHEMIC HEART

Imaging regarding ischemic heart disease is going to fall into two modalities; cardiac MR, and
Nuclear. Cardiac MRI currently offers the most complete evaluation o f ischemic heart disease.

Myocardial infarction typically is initiated by rupture o f an unstable coronary atherosclerotic
plaque, leading to abrupt arterial occlusion. The wave front of necrosis always starts
subendocardial and progresses to the subepicardium. The ischemic necrosis will affect not
just the myocardium but also blood vessels. The destruction o f small capillaries will not allow
contrast to the area o f injury. This is termed "microvascular obstruction" and manifests as
islands of dark signal in an ocean o f delayed enhancement. The presence o f microvascular
obstruction is an independent predictor o f death and adverse LV remodeling.

Testable Vocab:

 Stunned Myocardium: After an Acute Injury (ischemia or reperfusion injury), dysfunction
    of myocardium persists even after restoration of blood flow (can last days to weeks). A
    perfusion study will be normal, but the contractility is crap.

 Hibernating Myocardium: This is a more chronic process, and the result o f severe CAD
    causing chronic hypoperfusion. You will have areas o f decreased perfusion and
    decreased contractility even when resting. D on't get it twisted, this is not an infarct. On
    an FDG PET, this tissue will take up tracer more intensely than normal myocardium,
    and will also demonstrate redistribution o f thallium. This is reversible with
    revascularization.

 Scar: This is dead myocardium. It will not squeeze normally,  ``He's Dead Jim "
    so you'll have abnormal wall motion. It's not a zom bie.
    It will NOT come back to life with revascularization.

Delayed imaging: It works for two reasons: (1) Increased volume o f contrast material
distribution in acute myocardial infarction (and inflammatory conditions) (2) Scarred
myocardium washes out more slowly. It is done using an inversion recovery technique to
null normal myocardium, followed by a gradient echo. T1 shortening from the Gd looks bright
("Bright is Dead").

Why stress imaging is done: Because coronary arteries can auto-regulate, a stenosis
o f 85% can be asymptomatic in a resting state. So demand is increased (by exercise or drugs)
making a 45% stenosis significant. An inotropic stress agent (dobutamine) is used for wall
motion, and a vasodilator (adenosine) is used for perfusion analysis.

IVIRI in Acute iVil: Cardiac MRI can be done in the first 24 hours post MI (if the patient is
stable). Late gadolinium enhancement will reflect size and distribution o f necrosis.
Characteristic pattern is a zone o f enhancement that extends from the subendocardium
toward the epicardium in a vascular distribution. M icrovascular obstruction will present as
islands o f dark signal in the enhanced tissue (as described above), and this represents an acute
and subacute finding . Microvascular obstruction is N O T seen in chronic disease as these
areas will all turn to scar eventually.

In the acute setting (1 week) injured myocardium will have increased T2 signal, which can be
used to estimate the area at risk (T2 Bright - Enhanced = Salvageable Tissue).

Microvascular Obstruction: Islands o f dark                 Microvascular Obstruction
tissue in an ocean o f late Gd enhancement. These
indicate microvascular obliteration in the setting o f an
acute infarct. The Gd is unable to get to these regions
even after the restoration o f epicardial blood flow.
M icrovascular obstruction is a poor prognostic finding,
associated with lack o f functional recovery.

Key Point: It's NOT seen in ciironic infarct.

Trivia: M icrovascular obstruction is best seen on first pass imaging (25 seconds)

Ventricular Aneurysm: This is rare (5%), but
can occur as the result o f MI. The question is always
true vs false:

     * True: M outh is w ider than body. M yocardium
          is intact. Usually anterior-lateral wall.

     * False: Mouth is narrow compared to body.
          M yocardium is NOT intact (pericardial
          adhesions contain the rupture). Usually
          posterior-lateral wall. Higher risk o f rupture.

                                                            False Aneurysms are Usually Posterior Lateral
                                                             True Aneurysms are Usually Anterior Lateral

Viability - You can grade this based on % o f transmural           Viability Imaging:
thickness involved in the infarct.
                                                            Segmental imaging (imaging
      <25%: likely to improve with PCI                     over multiple heart beats)
      25-50%: may improve                                  T1 post contrast (10-15 min
      50-100%: unlikely to recover function                delay) inversion recovery

What is the timing on the bad sequelae of an Mi?

Dressier Syndrome (effusion)  4-6 weeks
Papillary Muscle Rupture      2-7 Days
Ventricular Pseudoaneurysm    3-7 Days
Ventricular Aneurysm          Months - Requires remodeling and thinning.
