Obviously the kidney can get injured in trauma (seen in about 10%). Injury can be graded
based on the presence o f hematoma -> laceration -> involvement o f the vein, artery, or UPJ
obstruction.

              Gamesmanship: A good "N ext Step" type question in the setting o f renal trauma

C (or pelvic fracture) would be to prompt you to get delayed imaging - this is helpful
              to demonstrate a urine leak.

Terminology:

· "Fractured Kidney" - A laceration, which extends the full
     depth of the renal parenchyma. By definition the laceration must
     connect two cortical surfaces - so think about it going all the way
     through.

    "Shattered Kidney" - This is a more severe form o f a
     fractured kidney. A kidney with 3 or more fragments - this is the
     most severe form of renal fracture.

location (and loss o f the normal rib protection).

Grading Trauma - A Source of Potentially Testable Trivia

Like many things you would simply look up on call, the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma
(AAST) Renal Injury Scale is a source of potential multiple choice trivia. I will attempt to summarize
and highlight the most easily tested trivia.

Indications: Typically any "trauma" that triggers the classic           Delays (5-15 mins)
trauma protocol. More specific indications include gross
hematuria or micro-hematuria with a low bloodpressure           Shows urine leaks (will be hyper

Protocol: Standard trauma protocol is an arterial phase (aorta  Focal Collections of contrast that
