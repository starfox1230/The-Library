               S E C T I O N 2:
           Renal Masses

Renal Cell Carcinoma -

The most common primary renal malignancy. RCC till proven                       T im ing
otherwise; (a) Enhances with contrast (> 15 HU), (b) calcifications in  Nephrogram phase
a fatty mass. Risk factors include tobacco use, syndromes like VHL,     (^0 seconds) = Most
chronic dialysis (> 3years), family history. These dudes make           sensitive for
hypervascular mets. They are ALWAYS lytic when they met to the          detection of RCC
bones.

· Pseudoenhancement: A less than 10 HU increase in attenuation is considered within the
  technical limits o f the study and is not considered to represent enhancement. M ore rare once
  a cyst is larger than 1.5 cm.

· Can RCC have fa t in it? - Oh yeah, for sure -especially clear cell. This leads to the potential
  sneaky situation o f a fat containing lesion in the liver (which can be a RCC met). Now to
  make this work they'd have to tell you the patient had RCC - or show you one. A helpful
  hint is that RCCs with macroscopic fat nearly always have some calcification/ossification - if
  they don't it's probably an AML.

Subtypes:

· Clear Cell - Most common subtype in the general population. This is also the one associated with
  VHL. It is typically more aggressive than papillary, and will enhance equal to the cortex on
  corticomedullary phase. The most classic look is a cvstic mass with enhancing components.

· Papillary - This is the second most common type. It is usually less aggressive than clear cell (more
  rare subtypes can be very aggressive). They are less vascular and will not enhance equal to the cortex
  on corticomedullary phase. They also are in the classic T2 dark differential (along with lipid poor AML
  and hemorrhagic cyst). Risk of primary renal malignancy in the transplanted kidnev is six times that of
  the regular Joe. A point of testable trivia is that these cancers are usually papillary subtypes.

· Medullary - Associated with Sickle Cell Trait. It's highly aggressive, and usually large and already
  metastasized at the time of diagnosis. Patient's are usually younger.

· C hrom ophobe - All you need to know is that it's associated with Birt Hogg Dube.

· Translocation - Most common RCC subtype in kids. A history of prior cytotoxic chemotherapy is
  classic.

Does AD Polycystic Kidney Disease increase your risk for RCC???? - Well No, but sorta.
The genetic syndrome does NOT intrinsically increase your risk. However, dialysis does.
Who gets dialysis?? People with ADPKD. It would be such a crap way to ask a question -
but could happen. If you are asked, I 'm recom m ending you say no to the increased risk, -
unless the question writer specifies that the patient is on dialysis.

Renal Lymphoma: This can
literally look like anything. Having said
that the most com mon appearance is
bilaterally, enlarged kidneys, with small,
low attenuation cortically based solid
nodules or masses ( "infiltrative soft
tissue in the renal hilum "), and
associated lymph nodes. A solitary mass
is seen in about 1/4 o f the cases.

Trivia: Out o f all the renal masses -           i Renal Lymphoma
lymphoma is the most likely to preserve
the normal reniform shape.

Trivia: Lymphoma is the most common metastatic tumor to invade / infiltrate the kidneys

Renal Leukemia: The kidney is the m ost com mon visceral organ involved. Typically
the kidneys are smooth and enlarged. Hypodense lesions are corticallv based only, with little
if any involvement o f the medulla.

Angiomyolipoma (AML); This is the m ost com mon benign tum or o f the kidney.
Almost all (95%) o f them have macroscopic fat, and this is the defining feature. They are
usually incidental (in the real world).

The things to know about them are:
(1) They are associated with Tuberous Sclerosis --

     Tuberous Sclerosis can be called Bourneville Disease (for the purpose o ffucking with you)
(2) They can bleed if they get big enough (> 4cm). It's controversial if they grow or bleed

     more in pregnancy (if they ask you, I guess you should say yes - because th at's the old
     knowledge but some modem papers are saying not for sure).
(3) They should never have calcifications (that's probably a RCC).
(4) They can be lipid poor (about 5% are), and those are T2 dark.

Gamesmanship: Traditional Spectral Fat Sat or In and Out o f Phase (India Ink) can be used
to suggest an AML. Just remember, rarely RCCs can have fat:

Fat with Calcifications = RCC, Fat with No Calcifications = Probably AML

                                            360
Oncocytoma - This is the second most common benign                          Oncocytoma
tumor (after AML). It looks a lot like a RCC, but has a
central scar 33% of the time (and 100% of the time on
multiple choice). There will be no malignant features (such
as vessel infiltration). They cannot be distinguished from
RCC on imaging and must be treated as RCC till proven
otherwise.

If they want to ask about an Oncocytoma they can show it 3
ways: (1) Solid Mass with central scar - CT or MRI, (2)
"Spoke wheel" vascular pattern on US, (3) Hotter than the
surrounding renal cortex - on PET CT.

Gamesmanship: I have encountered two types o f GU radiologists in my life. The first type is the
practical type - he/she doesn't EVER even mention oncocytoma, because enhancing renal masses
have to come out. Even if you biopsy it and get oncocytes, it doesn't matter because RCCs can
have oncocytic features.

The second type is more o f your classic academic type. To try          The PET Trick:
and sound impressive this person will often include this (and
other rare entities) in the differential. Another common            RCC is typically COLDER
psychopathology in these types is excessive word nazism             than surrounding renal
("don't say that, say this"). I 'm fairly certain you have met      parenchyma on PET,
this person - there is usually one in every section.
                                                                    Oncocytoma is typically
So if you are shown an enhancing renal mass with a central          HOTTER than surrounding
scar, how do you decide if it's a RCC or an oncocytoma? The         renal parenchyma on PET,
way to figure it out is simple - just read the mind o f the person
who wrote the question. If it's a practical type then all
enhancing renal masses are RCC till proven otherwise. If it's
the academic type then central scar = oncocytoma. You may
also think... which o f these two people is more likely to
volunteer to write board questions?

Trivia: A syndrome associated with bilateral oncocytomas is Birt Hogg Dube
(they also get chromophobe RCC).

Multilocular Cystic Nepiiroma -
"Non-communicating, fluid-filled locules, surrounded by
thick fibrous capsule." By definition these things are
characterized by the absence o f a solid component or
necrosis.

Buzzword: "protrudes into the renal pelvis."

The question is likely the bimodal occurrence
(4 year old boys, and 40 year old women).

I like to think o f this as the Michael Jackson lesion - it loves
young boys and middle aged women.

**Remember this is the "older" nomenclature. It is not the preferred nomenclature dude.
Nerds ruined my joke. Now these are "Adult MLCNs" and "Pediatric MLCNs." See page 229.

                         - More Retroperitoneum Fascial Anatomy -

I continued my analysis of this anatomy with a team of experts in the field of true love: who once again
came to one unanimous conclusion; that fascia is super boring and that I should get a life.

The retroperitoneum is "behind
the peritoneum" as the name
implies.

It is bordered anterior by the
anterior pararenal space (black
arrows) and posterior by the
transversalis fascia (white
arrows) - stuff we covered in
section 1.

Below the level of the kidneys, there is a blending of the
fascial planes which allows for potential spread of disease
between the retroperitoneum and the pelvis.

Illustrated with the light grey part (with the black arrows)
demonstrating the inferior extension / communication of
the retroperitoneum.

                                                                            · White = Peritoneum
                                                                            · Light Grey Around the White =

                                                                               Compartments Communicating with the
                                                                               Retroperitoneum

Anatomic Trivia: The RP contains the lower esophagus, most of the duodenum, the ascending and
descending colon, the kidneys, ureters, adrenals, pancreas (minus the tail), aorta, IVC, and the upper 2/3
of the rectum (some people say only the upper 1/3 is completely RP).

The classic tricks for multiple choice are:

· The pancreatic tail is NOT being part of the RP.

· Lower 1/3 of the rectum is NOT being part of the RP -- it is "sub" peritoneal.

Pathology: -75% of the primary retroperitoneal neoplasms are malignant. Any tumor in this location is
guilty until proven otherwise. Having said that, there is an enormous amount of path that can occur in
this location -- I'm gonna try and focus on what I think is probably the highest yield. The chart on the
following page does not include adrenal tumors - I'll cover those in the endocrine chapter (and peds). RP
Fibrosis is mentioned briefly- it is discussed in detail later in the chapter. Neurogenic tumors will be
covered in the neuro chapter.
