Periventricular Leukomalacia ( Hypoxic-lsGhemic Encephalopathy of the Newborn)

This is the result o f an ischemic / hemorrhagic injury, typically from a hypoxic insult during
birthing. The kids who are at the greatest risk are premature and little (less than 1500 g). The
testable stigmata is cerebral palsy - which supposedly develops in 50%. The pathology favors
the watershed areas (characteristically the white matter dorsal and lateral to the lateral
ventricles).

The milder finding can be very subtle. Here are some tricks:

(1) Use PreTest Probability: The kid is described as premature or low birth weight.

(2) Brighter than the Choroid: The choroid plexus is an excellent internal control. The
      normal white matter should always be less bright (less hyperechoic) when compared to the
      choroid.

(3) "Blush '' and "F laring" : These are two potential distractors that need to be differentiated
      from legit grade 1 PVL. "Blush " describes the physiologic brightness o f the
      posterosuperior periventricular white matter - this should be less bright than choroid, and
      have a more symmetric look. "F laring" is similar to blush, but a more hedgy term. It's the
      word you use if you aren't sure if it's real PVL or just the normal brightness often seen in
      premature infants white matter. The distinction is that "fla rin g " should go away in a
      week. Grade 1 PVL persists > 7 days.

The later findings are more obvious with the development of cavitary periventricular cysts.
The degree o f severity is described by the size and distribution o f these cysts. These things take
a while to develop - some people say up to 4 weeks. So, if they show you a day 1 newborn
with cystic PVL they are leading you to conclude that the vascular insult occurred at least 2
weeks prior to birth (not during birth - which is often the case).

       (hyperechoic relative to choroid)

Trivia

        The most severe grade (4), which has subcortical cysts, is actually more common in
        full term infants rather than preterms.

Germinal Matrix Hemorrhage [ GMH)

I like to think about the germinal matrix as an embryologic seed that sprouts out various
development cells during brain development. Just like a seed needs water to grow, the
germinal matrix is highly vascular. It's also very friably and susceptible to stress.
Additionally, premature brains suck at cerebral blood flow auto-regulation. Mechanism:
Fragile vessels + too much pressure/flow = bleeds
An im portant thing to understand is that the germ inal m atrix is an em bryological entity. So it
only exists in premature infants. As the fetus matures the thing regresses and disappears.
By 32 weeks, germinal matrix is only present at the caudothalam ic groove.
By 36 weeks, you basically can't have it (if no GM, then no GM hem orrhage).
Take home p oin t - No G M H e m o rrh a g e in a full te rm in fan t.
Gamesmanship: Similar looking bleed in a fiill term infant say "choroid plexus
hemorrhage" (not GMH).
The scenario will always call the kid a premature infant (probably earlier than 30 weeks). The
earlier they are bom the more com m on it is. Up to 40% occur in the first 5 hours, and m ost
have occurred by day 4 (90%). A good thing to rem em ber is that 90% occur in the first week.
Screening: Head US is used to screen for this pathology. Testable trivia includes:
· Who should be screened? Premature Infants (<32 weeks, < 1500 grams). Premature Infants

  with Lethargy, Seizures, D ecreased H em atocrit or a history o f "he d o n 't look so good."
· When do you do the head US? First w eek o f life (rem em ber this is w hen 90% o f them occur).

  Some people will tell you - "first week and first month" (but that varies from institution).
  Some people will also say - "every kid gets a head US prior to discharge from the NICU" - but
  that is mainly done to detect PVL (not necessarily GMH).

                                                                 165
