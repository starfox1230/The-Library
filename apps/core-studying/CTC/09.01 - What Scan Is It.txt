                                       SECTION l:
                              W HA T SCAN IS IT?

Ok, here is the scenario that I want you to be prepared for:
The plane has crashed. A ll the nuclear techs are dead. Prior to the plane crashing, they
completed several studies, butfo rg o t to label them or give indications. The bean counter (non-
MD) who is running the hospital is breathing down yo u r neck to read these studies now,
because the metrics he set up are gonna look bad at the next QA/QC meeting. So now you have
to interpret nuclear studies, and you d o n 't know why they did them or even what tracer was
given.
Fortunately, you trained for this as part o f your preparation for the Exam.
Seriously, this is famously one o f the most common ways nuclear medicine is tested. It was
like that on the old oral boards, and probably still like that now (same knuckle heads writing the
questions). It's such a ridiculous thing to ask and yet it almost always finds its way onto the
exam in one way or another.
My primary advice: D o n 't Fight It. Games are Best Played As Games.

* Note the M IBG is under both heart and no heart - this is because i t 's variable.
   MIBG with 1-123 is more likely to have heart than 1-131.

This is an alternative pathway that some people prefer. This one focuses more on photon
output (how light or dark stuff is), and liver and spleen. It removes the confusion o f heart

Another alternative way to work the bones pathway is to ask Lacrimal Glands? Gallium will
have them, WBC scans and Sulfur Colloid will NOT. The trick on Lacrimal Glands is free
Tc (but bones will be real weak on that one). M IBG can have lacrimal activity , but again no
bones.

                            What Scan is it - Special Topics:

                                                      MIBG

I'll talk about this more later in the chapter, but MIBG can be labeled with either 1-123 or 1-131.
The energy of the 1-123 (159 keV) is better for imaging, you can give a higher dose, and the
results are typically available within 24 hours (1-131 usually requires delays to optimize target to
background noise). Having said that 1-131 labeled MIBG is still used all over the place, especially
with adults. 1-131 may also be better for estimation of tumor uptake, for planning related to
MIBG therapy. The point of me rambling here is that you have two different MIBGs - so telling
which scan is which requires a little finesse.

It has variable cardiac uptake, so it finds itself on multiple branch points. Cardiac activity is more
often seen on an 1-123 MIBG scan (as opposed to 1-131 MIBG). Another thing that helps me
remember this stuff: when you do a MIBG you are often looking for neuroblastoma. If the kidney
was also hot it would be hard to tell a mass near the kidney from the kidney - so part of the
reason the study works is that the kidney does NOT take up MIBG.

Adrenal glands; Normal adrenal glands are not seen. However, you can have faint uptake in the
adrenals in about 15% of 1-131 patients, and around 75% of 1-123 patients. So, if you see
adrenals and you are sure they are normal (faint and symmetric) it's more likely to be 1-123.

                                         Just like MIBG can be labeled with either 1-123 or 1-131

                                         start to get some bowel uptake. Just like an In-WBC the

                  oppressed by the tyranny o f brain tissue (it can't diffuse out).

Tc-99m ECD        Mechanism is similar to HMPAO with the testable difference being that ECD has a more
