THIS THAT: Crohns Disease vs Ulcerative Colitis:

Crohns Disease: Typically seen in a young adult (15-30), but has a second smaller
peak later 60-70. Discontinuous involvement o f the entire GI tract (mouth -> asshole).
Stomach, usually involves antrum (R am 's H orn Deformity). Duodenal involvem ent is rare,
and NEVER occurs without antral involvement. Small bowel is involved 80% o f the time,
with the terminal ileum almost always involved (Marked Narrowing = String Sign). After
surgery the "neo-term inal ileum " will frequently be involved. The colon involvem ent is
usually right sided, and often spares the rectum / sigmoid. Complications include fistulae,
abscess, gallstones, fatty liver, and sacroiliitis.

Ulcerative Colitis:

Just like Crohns, it typically occurs in a "young adult" (age 15-40), with a second peak at 60-70.
Favors the male gender. It involves the rectum 95% of the time, and has retrograde progression.
Terminal ileum is involved 5-10% of the time via backwash ileitis (wide open appearance). It is
continuous and does not "skip" like Crohns. It is associated with Colon Cancer, Primary Sclerosing
Cholangitis, and Arthritis (similar to Ankylosing Spondyhtis).

           On Barium, it is said that the colon is ahaustral, with a diffuse granular appearing mucosa.
           "Lead Pipe" is the buzzword (shortened from fibrosis).

Here is a key clinical point: UC has an increased risk of cancer (probably higher than Crohns), and it
doesn't classically have enlarged lymph nodes (like Crohns does), so if you see a big lymph node in
an UC patient (especially one with long standing disease), you have to think that it might be cancer.

                      MISGLarge Bowel Pathology

Toxic Megacolon: Ulcerative colitis, and to a lesser degree Crohns, is the primary cause.
C-Diff can also cause it. Gaseous dilation distends the transverse colon (on upright films), and the
right and left colon on supine films. Lack of haustra and pseudopolyps are also seen. Some people
say the presence of normal hausta excludes the diagnosis. Don't do a barium enema because of the
risk of perforation. Another piece of trivia is that peritonitis can occur without perforation.

Behcets: Ulcers of the penis and mouth. Can also affect GI tract (and looks like Crohns) - most
commonly affects the ileocecal region. It is also a cause of pulm onary artery aneurysms (test
writers like to ask that).

Diverticulosis /Diverticulitis: Some trivia worth knowing is that diverticulosis actually
bleeds more than diverticulitis. Right-sided is less common (but is seen in young Asians). Fistula
formation is actually most common with diverticulitis, and can occur to anything around it (another
piece of bowel, the bladder, etc..).

Epiploic Appendagitis I Omental Infarct:

Epiploic appendages along the serosal surface of the colon
can torse, most commonly on the left. There is not
typically concentric bowel wall thickening (unlike
diverticulifis).

Omental infarction is typically a larger mass with a more
oval shape and central low density. It is more common on
the right (R O I- right omental infarct). Both entities are
self-limiting.

Appendicitis: The classic pathways are: obstruction (fecalith or reactive lymphoid tissue) ->
mucinous fluid builds up increasing pressure -> venous supply is compressed -> necrosis starts ->
wall breaks down -> bacteria get into wall -> inflammation causes vague pain (umbilicus) ->
inflamed appendix gets larger and touches parietal peritoneum (pain shifts to RLQ).

It occurs in an adolescent or young adult (or any age). The measurement of 6mm was originally
described with data from ultrasound compression, but people still generally use it for CT as well.
Secondary signs of inflammation are probably more reliable for CT.

Gamesmanship: In pregnancy MRI without contrast is the test of choice

Appendix Mucocele - Mucinous cystadcnomas are the
most common mucinous tumor of the appendix. They produce
mucin and can really dilate up and get big. They look similar to
cystadenocarcinomas and can perforate leading to
pseudomyxoma peritonei. On ultrasound the presence of an
"onion sign" - layering within a cystic mass - is a suggestive
feature of a mucocele.

                                                                297

· Sigmoid: Most common adult form. Seen in the nursing home patient (chronic
  constipation is a predisposing factor). This is the "Grandma" volvulus. Buzzword is
  coffee bean sign (or inverted 3 sign). Another less common buzzword is Frimann
  Dahl's sign - which refers to 3 dense lines (arrows) converging towards the site of
  obstruction (star). Points to the RUQ. Recurrence rate after decompression = 50%.

· Cecal: Seen in a younger person (20-40). Associated with people with a "long
  mesentery." More often points to the LUQ. Much less common than sigmoid.

· Cecal Bascule: Anterior folding of the cecum, without twisting. Lotta surgical
  text books dispute this thing even being real (they think it's a focal ileus). The
  finding is supposedly dilation of the cecum in an ectopic position in the middle
  abdomen, without a mesenteric twist. As the terminal ileum is not involved, don't

Colonic Pseudo-Obstruction (Colonic Ileus, Ogilvie Syndrome): Usually seen after serious
medical conditions and in nursing home patients. It can persist for years, or progress to bowel necrosis
and perforation. The classic look is marked diffuse dilation of the large bowel, without a discrete
transition point.

Diversion Colitis /Pouchitis: Bacterial overgrowth in a blind loop which gets no poop (surgery
that creates a blind loop without poop). Classic with pre-existing Inflammatory Bowl Disease.

Colitis Cystica: This cystic dilation of the mucous glands comes in two flavors:

(1) Superficial: The superficial kind consists of cysts that are small in the entire colon. It's associated
with vitamin deficiencies and tropical sprue. Can also be seen in terminal leukemia, uremia, thyroid
toxicosis, and mercury poisoning.

(2) Deep /Profunda: These cysts may be large and are seen in the pelvic colon and rectum.

^^1 %   Rectal Cavernous Hemangioma: Obviously very rare. Just know it's associated
i\. iV  with a few syndromes; Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber, and Blue Rubber Bleb. They might show
        you a ton of phleboliths down there.

Gossypiboma: This isn't really a GI pathology but it's an abscess mimic. It's a retained cotton
product or surgical sponge and it can elicit an inflammatory response.

Parasite that causes bloody diarrhea. Can cause liver abscess, spleen abscess, or
even brain abscess. Within the colon it is one of the causes of toxic megacolon.
They are typically "flask-shaped ulcers" on endoscopy. With regard to barium, the
buzzword is '"coned cecum" referring to a change in the normal bulbous
appearance of the cecum, to that of a cone. Involves the cecum and ascending
colon (usually) and unlike many other GI infections, spares the term inal ileum.

Colonic TB:

Typically involves the terminal ileum, and is            Coned
another cause of the "coned cecum" appearance.           Shaped
