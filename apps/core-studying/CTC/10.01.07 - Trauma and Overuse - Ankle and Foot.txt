C asanova F ra c tu re - If you see bilateral calcaneal fractures, you should "next step? " look
at the spine (T12-L2) for a compression or burst fracture. These tend to occur in axial loading
patterns (possibly from jum ping out a window to avoid an angry husband).

Trivia:
· Peroneal tendons can become entrapped with lateral calcaneal fractures.
· Calcaneal fractures are the most common (60%) Tarsal Bone Fx
· Fractures o f the calcaneus are either extra-articular or intra-articular - depends on subtalarjoint

  involvement. Intra-articular fractures will have a fracture line through the "critical angle o f
  Gissane "

you were a surgeon assisting in the Napoleonic invasion of
Russia. The Lisfranc ligament connects the medial cuneiform to

Ligam entous Injury: The highest yield fact is that the anterior talofibular ligament
is the w eakest ligam ent and the m ost frequently injured (usually from inversion).

Posterior Tib iai Tendon inju ry / Dysfunction: This results in a progressive
flat foot deformity, as the PTT is the primary stabilizer o f the longitudinal arch. When
chronic, the tear is most com mon behind the medial m alleolus (this is w here the most
friction is). W hen acute, the tear is most common at the insertion into the navicular bone.
Acute Flat Arch should make you think of PTT tear.

You will also have a hindfoot valgus deformity (from unopposed           \  /
peroneal brevis action). The other point o f trivia to know is that
the spring ligament is a secondary supporter o f the arch (it holds      1/ \W
up the talar head), and it will thicken and degenerate without the
help o f the PTT. D on't get it twisted though, the spring ligam ent is  Hindfoot Valgus

Alternatively, there may be 3 instead of 2 tendons.
The tear occurs at the lateral malleolus.

There is a strong (80%) association with lateral
ligament injury.

Anterolateral im pingem ent Syndrome:
Injury to the anterior talofibular ligaments and tibiofibular ligaments (usually fi-om an
inversion injury) can cause lateral instability, and chronic synovial inflammation.

You can eventually produce a "m ass" o f hypertrophic synovial tissue in the lateral gutter.

The M RI finding is a "meniscoid mass" in the lateral gutter of the ankle, which is a
balled up scar (T1 and T2 dark).

Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome:                             Tarsal tunnel is covered by the flexor retinaculum

It's usually unilateral (unlike carpal tunnel
which is usually bilateral), usually
"idiopathic" although pes planus (hindfoot
valgus) can predispose by tightening the
retinaculum.

Having said that, any mass lesion (ganglion cysts, neurogenic tumors, varicosities, lipomas,
severe tenosynovitis, and accessory muscles) can cause compression of the nerve in the
tunnel.

M o rto n 's N eu ro m a: Soft tissue mass (tear drop shaped) shown between the and 4`t'
metatarsal heads (third intermetatarsal space) is most likely a Morton's Neuroma (especially on
multiple choice tests). The proposed pathology results from compression / entrapment of the plantar
digital nerve in this location by the intermetatarsal ligament. Over time this results in thickening and
development of perineural fibrosis.

              "M ulder's Sign " - is a physical exam (a sonographic sign) where you squeeze the patients
              foot and reproduce the pain (or see the scar pop out under ultrasound).

Trivia: Morton's Neuroma is NOT a Neuroma (a tumor).            Plantar Ligament
It's a scar.

Classic Look: It is a scar, so it's gonna be dark on T1 and T2
(usually). It is tear drop shaped and projects downward.

People make a big deal about this thing staying below the
plantar ligament.

The reason is that your primary differential is interm etatarsal bursitis - which will extend above
the transverse ligament, be fluid signal, and have a more cystic look. Small bursa in this location can be
normal as long as the stay smaller than 3mm.
