        SEC TIO N 5:

LUCENT LESIONS

FEGNOM AStnC is a "useful" mnemonic for lucent bone lesions made popular by Clyde Helms. As
it turns out, you can rearrange the letters o f FEGNOMASHIC to form a word FOG MACHINES. I
find it a lot easier to remember a mnemonic if it actually forms a real word. Having said that, the
whole idea o f memorizing a list o f 11 or 12 barely related things is stupid. You would never give a
differential that included all o f those, as they occur in different places, in different ages, and often
look very different.

Differentials (for people who know what they are looking at) are usually never deeper than 3 or 4
things. If you are giving a differential o f 12 things, just say you don't know what it is. Seriously in
the real world bone lesions only come in 3 flavors; 1 - Bad (cancer or infection), 2 - Obviously
benign (not sure I'll waste saliva mentioning it in my rep o rt), 3 - Ehh hard to tell - get a follow up.
This is actually pretty much true o f lesions everywhere in the body. Realizing this allows for the
following paradigm shift:

Eyeball: Oh Shit! A lesion that has non-aggressive  Eyeball: Oh Shit! A lesion that has non-
features. I wonder what it is....                   aggressive features. I wonder what it is....

we are smart.                                       Literally no one will ever read this report.

B ut... we aren't training for real life. The realm o f multiple choice is obviously different.

For multiple choice, when you encounter a lucent bone lesion you can expect one of two questions
(1) what is it ? or (2) what is it associated with ? In either case you are going to need to figure out
what it is. In the real world you would probably have to give a short differential, but in the world of
multiple choice you will have to come up with one answer. D on't fret, they have to give you clues
so you can pick just one. A useful mental exercise when eliminating muhiple choice distractors is to
ask yourself "why is it NOT this?" It's an exercise that is often not performed at the workstation -
but very valuable in the test environment - especially for these types o f questions.

Here is my suggested method:                                         Age - Key Facts
                                                            < 30 = EG, ABC, NOP,

            Location:

Epiphysis:

In general, only a few lesions tend to arise in the epiphysis. The "four horseman o f the
(e)apophysis" is the mnemonic I like to use, and I think about the company AIG that was
involved in some scandal a few years ago. A IG "the evil" Company.

For the purpose o f muhiple choice tests, it is im portant to not
forget about the malignant tumor at the end o f the bone                       Carpals,
(epiphysis) - Clear Cell Chondrosarcoma. This guy is slow                      Patella,

epiphyseal you say Clear Cell Chondrosarcoma.

M etap h ysis

The metaphysis is the fastest growing area o f a bone, w ith the best blood supply. This
excellent blood supply results in an increased predilection for Mets and Infection. Most of the
cystic bone lesions can occur in the metaphysis.

Diaphysis
Just like the metaphysis, most entities can occur in the diaphysis (they just do it less).

                    Pathology-For Trivia

Fibrous Dysplasia:

Fibrous dysplasia is a skeletal developmental anomaly of osteoblasts - failure
of normal maturation and differentiation which results in replacement of the
normal medullary space.

Famously "can look like anything", with phases like Pagets (lytic, mixed,        Shepherd Crook
blastic) - although the most classic appearance is a "long lesion, in a long     -Coxa Varus Angulation

Jaffe-Cam panacci Syndrome:
Syndrome of multiple NOFs, cafe-au-lait spots, mental retardation, hypogonadism,
and cardiac malformations. They're at high risk for pathological fractures.

                    86
Enchondroma:

This guy is a tumor of the medullary cavity composed of hyaline cartilage. They become progressively
more common with age - peaking around 10-30 years old.

The sneaky thing about this lesion is that it looks different depending on the body part it is in.

 Humerus or Femur = Arcs and Rings
 Fingers or Toes = Lytic

The ARCS AND RINGS is the more classic textbook look with the irregularly
speckled calcification of chondroid matrix. Just don't forget that this classic matrix
is not found in the fingers or toes.

The enchondroma is actually the most common cystic lesion in the hands and feet. Just like fibrous
dysplasia, this lesion does not have periostitis.

Eosinophilic G ranulom a (EG):

This is typically included in every differential for people less than 30 (peak age is 5-10).
It can be solitary (usually) or multiple.

There are 3 classic appearances - for the purpose o f multiple choice:
(1) Vertebra plana in a kid
(2) Skull with lucent "beveled edge" lesions (also in a kid).
(3) "Floating Tooth" with lytic lesion in alveolar ridge -- this would be a differential case

The appearance is highly variable and can be lytic or blastic, with or without a sclerotic border,
and with or without a periosteal response. Can even have an osseous sequestrum.
As such, EG can be very similar in appearance to a Brodie abscess / subacute osteomyelitis
(similar imaging, similar ages - peds).

Giant Cell Tum or (GCT):
This guy has some key criteria (which lend themselves well to multiple choice tests).
They include:

          - Physis MUST be closed
" - Non Sclerotic Border

          - Abuts the articular surface

Another trick is to show you a pulm onary met, and ask if it could be a GCT? The answer is
yes (although this is rare) GCT is considered "quasi-m alignant" because it can be locally
invasive and about 5% will have pulmonary mets (which are still curable by resection). As a
result o f this, it should be resected w ith wide margins.

Things to know about GCTs:
          - Most common in the knee - abutting the articular surface
          - Most common at age 20-30 * physis must be closed
          - There is an association with ABCs (they can turn into them)
          - They are "quasi-malignant" - 5% have lung mets
          - Fluid levels on MRI

Modality Trivia:
                                                                       Arthritis: Can occur from

                                                                       secondarily from altered

 MRI: "Lots o f edema." I 'll say that again "large am ount o f edema fo r the size o f the lesion. "
  Adjacent soft tissue edema is also common - don't let that fool you.

 Nuke Bone Scan: "Double Density Sign" - very intense central activity at nidus, surrounded
  by less intensity o f reactive bone. A common distractor is a stress fracture. Stress fractures
  are linear. 0 .0 . should be round.

Scoliosis Trivia: When you have them in the spine (most common in      Convex
the posterior elements of the lumbar spine), you frequently have an
associated painful scoliosis with the convexity pointed away from
the lesion.

Treatment:
These can be treated with percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (as long as it's not within 1 cm
o f a nerve or other vital structure - typically avoided in hands, spine, and pregnant patients).

Osteoblastom a:

Basically it's an osteoid osteom a that is larger than 2 cm. It's seen in patients < 30 years old.
They are most likely to show this in the posterior elements. It also occurs in the long bones
(35%) and when it does it is usually diaphyseal (75%).

Aneurysm al Bone Cyst (ABC):                                            Classic DDx for
                                                                       Lucent Lesion in
Aneurysmal bone cysts are aneurysmal lesions o f bone with thin-      Posterior Elements:
walled, blood-filled spaces (fluid-fluid level on MRI). Patients are
usually < 30. They may develop following trauma.                         Osteoblastoma
                                                                               ABC
Location: Tibia > Vert > Femur > Humerus                                        Met

They can be described as primary ABC, presumably arising denovo or secondary ABC,
associated with another tumor (classic GCT). They are commonly associated with other
benign lesions.

Things to know about ABC:
- Up to 40% o f secondary ABC's are associated with giant cell tumor o f bone.
- It's on the DDx for Fluid - Fluid Level on MRI
- Patient < 3 0
- Tibia is the most common site

Solitary (Unicam eral) Bone Cyst:

It w ould be unusual to see one o f these in a patient older than 30. M ost common in the
tubular bones (90-95 %) usually humerus or femur. Unique feature: "Always located
centrally."

It's going to be shown one o f two ways: (1) W ith a fracture through it in the humerus
(probably with a fallen fragment sign) or (2) As a lucent lesion in the calcaneus (probably
with a fallen fragment sign).
T \\q fallen fragment sign (bone fragm ent in the dependent portion o f a lucent bone lesion) is
pathognomonic of solitary bone cyst.

Brown Tumor (Hyperparathyroidism ):

The "brown tumor" represents localized accumulations o f giant cells and fibrous tissue (in
case someone asks). They appear as lytic or sclerotic lesions with other findings of
hyperparathyroidism (subperiosteal bone resorption). In other words, they need to tell you he/
she has hyperparathyroidism first. They may just straight up tell you, or they will show you
some bone resorption first (classically on the side o f a finger, edge o f a clavicle, or under a
rib).

These things have different stages o f healing / sclerosis. They resorb and can become totally
sclerotic / healed, when the Hyper PTH is treated.

 More on this in the arthritis section -- later in the chapter

                                                         90
Chondroblastom a:

This is seen in kids (90% age 5-25). They classically show it in two ways
(1) in the epiphysis o f the tibia on a 15 year old, or (2) in an epiphyseal equivalent.

So what are the epiphyseal equivalents???

   D Patella
   D Calcaneus
   D Carpal Bones
   D A nd all the Apophyses (greater and less trochanter, tuberosities, etc...)

Features of the tumor include; A thin sclerotic rim, extension across the physeal plate
(25-50%), periostitis (30%). Actual location: femur > humerus > tibia . This may show bone
marrow edema, and soft tissue edem a on M RI (M RI can m islead you into thinking it's a bad
thing). This is one o f the only bone lesions that is often NOT T2 bright. They tend to
reoccur after resection (like 30% of the time).

            Gamesmanship Hip: W hen you have a chondroblastoma in the hip, it tends to fa vo r
             the greater trochanter (more than thefem oral epiphysis).

Chondromyxoid Fibroma:

This is the least com mon benign lesion o f cartilage. It is usually in patients younger than 30.
The typical appearance is an osteolytic, elongated in shape, eccentrically located,
metaphyseal lesion, with cortical expansion and a "bite" like configuration. Sorta looks like
an NOF - with the classic location in the proxim al m etaphyseal region o f the tibia.

                                           The Hip

 Greater Trochanter - Remember this is an epiphyseal equivalent and the
 chrondroblastomas prefer it to the femoral epiphysis. You can get all the other DDxs
 (ABC, Infection, GCT, e tc ... here as well). Plus, you can have avulsions o f the gluteus
 medius and minimus.

 Lesser Trochanter - An avulsion here without significant clinical history should make you
 think pathologic fracture.

 The Intertrochanteric Region: Classic DDx here: Lipoma, Solitary Bone Cyst, Monostotic
 Fibrous Dysplasia, Liposclerosing Myxofibroma.

The suggested Promethean method is to first use           Epiphysis                                             Epiphysis
location within the bone, and then use characteristic                                            Anterior M etaphysis
appearance as a secondary discriminator.

First let us take a closer look at the calcaneus.
Remember this thing is an epiphyseal equivalent, but
only in certain locations. It's probably better to think
about the bone like a hybrid long bone - complete
with a diaphysis, two metaphysis, and three
epiphysis.

Chondroblastoma:                              Giant Cell Tumor: Can also involve the epiphysis
                                              (although it typically starts out metaphyseal and grows into the
08                                            epiphysis). Remember these things required a closed physis.
                                              The Posterior Metaphvsis / Epiphysis is favored.
 Most classic epiphysis lesion - with a
  preference for the superior epiphysis near  Osteoid Osteoma:
  the talocalcaneal articulation (although
  they can be at any of the 3 epiphysis).       Talus > Calcaneus
                                                Similar to Chondroblastoma in
 Lucent lesion, that can have some             favoring the superior epiphysis
  internal calcifications.                      near the talocalcaneal
                                                articulation.
                                                Distinction is the sclerotic
                                                thickening of the adjacent bone
                                                and the radiolucent nidus.

The calcaneal apophysis (equivalent to the metaphyseal region of long bones)
will have a similar predilection for collection hematogenous spread of both
infection or cancer (GU or Colon).

In both cases the involvement favors the posterior meta-epiphvseal region
(which has the richest blood supply), with lesions potentially growing large
enough to involve the entire calcaneus.

S olitary Bone Cyst: The typical location for this lesion is the             Younger than 20
diaphysis (anterior 1/3 laterally). This will have sharp edges. A           Fallen Fragment
thick sclerotic edge with a multiloculated appearance is helpful. The        TI Dark, T2 Bright
"fallen fragment" will be more in the bottom if shown ~ although
fractures in the calcaneus are much less common than in the arm.                                c

intraosseous Lipoma: This is also typically located in the                 Older than 20
diaphysis (anterior 1/3 laterally). If they show you this, it will either  Central Fragment
have (a) fat density on CT or MRI, or (b) a central fragment -             Isointense to Fat
stuck within the middle of the fat. This calcification / fat necrosis      on all sequence-^
occurs about 50% of the time in the real world (nearly 100% on
pictures shown on tests), and is secondary to fat necrosis.

Pseudo-cyst: This is a variation on the nonnal trabecular
pattern, which creates a central triangular radiolucent area. This area
is sometimes called the "pseudo-cyst triangle" and is obnoxiously
located in the same anterior 1/3 as the SBC and Lipoma. Supposedly
the persistence of thin trabeculae, visible nutrient foramen, and the
classic location are helpful in telling it from the other benign
entities.

M e ta s ta tic Disease: Should be on the differential for any patient over 40 with a lytic
lesion. As a piece o f trivia renal cancer is ALWAYS lytic (usually).
 Classic Elastic Lesions: Prostate, Carcinoid, M edulloblastoma
 Classic Lytic Lesions: Renal and Thyroid
Next Step - Prostate M et vs Bone Island??? - Get a Bone Scan
 Bone Island should be mild (or not active)
 Prostate Met should be HOT

M ultiple M yelom a (M M ): Plasma cell proliferation increases surrounding osteolytic
activity (in case som eone asks you the mechanism). U sually in older patient (4 0 's-80's).
Plasmacytomas can precede clinical or hematologic evidence o f myeloma by 3 years.
They usually have discrete margins, and can be solitary or multiple. Vertebral body
destruction with sparing o f the posterior elements is classic. Bone Scan is often negative,
skeletal survey is better (but horribly painful to read), and MRI is the m ost sensitive.
Additional classic (testable) scenario: M M manifesting as Diffuse Osteopenia

Myeloma Related Conditions:
Plasmacytoma (usually under 40): This is a discrete, solitary mass o f neoplastic monoclonal
plasm a cells in either bone or soft tissue {extramedullary subtype). It is associated with latent
systemic disease in the majority o f affected patients. It can be considered as a singular
counterpart multiple myeloma. The lesions look like a geographic lytic area, sometimes with
expansile remodeling.
"M ini Brain Appearance " - Plasm acytom a in vertebral body
P O E M S: This is basically ""M yelom a with Sclerotic M ets.'' It's a rare m edical syndrome with
plasma cell proliferation (typically m yelom a), neuropathy, and organomegaly.
