The Lefort Fracture Panern System:

In the dark ages, Rene LeFort beat the shit out of cadavers with clubs and threw them off buildings
it was "science". He described 3 facial fracture patterns that interns in ENT & people who write
multiple test questions think are important. This can be overly complicated but the most common
ways questions are written tend to be (A) asking the buzzword or (B) asking essential components.

SB Buzzwords:                       LeFort 3: "The Face              LF 3:
                                    Separated from the Cranium"
                                    or "Floating Face"           Transverse

                                    LeFort 2: "The Maxilla
                                    Separated from the Face"
                                    or ^Pyramidal"

                                    LeFort 1; "The Palate
                                    Separated from the Maxilla'
                                    or "Floating Palate"

Essential Components:               Pterygoid process
All 3 fracture types share the      is involved -
pterygoid process fracture.         you might have a

Anterolateral                               can develop adhesions, which obstruct the
Margin of the                                sinus and result in mucocele development.
Nasal Fossa

Fracture:                                   They are usually T1 bright, with a thin rim
Involves the                                of enhancement (tumors more often have
Inferior                                     solid enhancement). The frontal sinus is

Temporal Bone Fractures:

The traditional way to classify these is longitudinal and transverse, and this is almost
certainly how the questions will be written. In the real world that system is old and
worthless, as most fractures are complex with components o f both. The real predictive
finding o f value is violation o f the otic capsule - as described in m ore m odem papers.

                  Longitudinal                      Transverse                              |
Long Axis of T-Bone
More Common                            Short Axis of T-Bone
More Ossicular Dislocation
Less Facial Nerve Damage (around 20%)  Less Common
More Conductive Hearing Loss
                                       More Vascular Injury (Carotid / Jugular)

                                       More Facial Nerve Damage (>30%)

                                       More Sensorineural Hearing Loss

                   Things to Know About Facial Fractures:

 Nasal Bone is the most com mon fracture

 Zygomaticomaxillary Complex Fracture (Tripod) is the most common fracture
pattern, and involves the zygoma, inferior orbit, and lateral orbit.

 Le-Fort Fractures are both a stupid and a high yield topic in facial trauma - for
multiple choice. Floating Palate = 1, Pyramidal = 2, Separated Face = 3

 Transverse vs Longitudinal Temporal Bone Fractures - this classification system
is stupid and outdated since m ost are mixed and otic capsule violation is a way
better predictive facto r... but this is still extrem ely high yield
