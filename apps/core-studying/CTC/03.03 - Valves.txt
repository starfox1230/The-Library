Looking at Valves: ECHO is almost always the best first choice to look at the valves. We study so
much MRI for board exams we forget that ECHO is actually superior. Having said that MRI trivia is
more likely to show up on this exam - so lets dish out some trivia:

 Transverse images through the aortic valve let you look at the morphology (how many cusps)
 Orthogonal Long Axis Views let you look for flow voids on one side of the valve
 Transverse slices positioned at the valve (or slightly below) allow you quantify regurgitant volume --

  measuring during diastole

Aortic Stenosis: This may be congenital (bicuspid) or Acquired (Degenerative or Rheumatic
Heart). Increased afterload can lead to concentric LV hypertrophy. Peak velocity through the valve
can be used to grade the severity. Velocity-encoded cine MR imaging (VENC), which also answers
to the name "velocity mapping" or "phase-contrast imaging", is an MRI technique for quantifying the
velocity of flowing blood (if anyone would happen to ask). Dilation of ascending aorta is due to jet
phenomenon related to a stenotic valve. Aortic Stenosis comes in three flavors:
(a) valvular, (b) subvalvular, (c) and supravalvular. Valvular is the most common (90%).

 When I say "Supra-valvular Aortic Stenosis" you say Williams Syndrome
 When I say "Bicuspid Aortic Valve and Coarctation" you say Turners Syndrome

Bicuspid Aortic Valve: This is very common, some                    Bicuspid Valve
sources will say nearly 2% of the general population. As a          (the way people

Trivia to know:
 Aortic Stenosis is the most common complication
 Bicuspid aortic valve (even in absence of stenosis) is an

  independent risk factor for aortic aneurysm. Severity of
  valve dysfunction does not predict aneurysm formation.

 Association with Turners Syndrome, and Coarctation
 Association with AD Polycystic kidney disease

Aortic Regurgitation:

Seen with bicuspid aortic valves, bacterial endocarditis, Marfan's, aortic root dilation from HTN, and
aortic dissection. How rapid the regurgitation onsets determines the hemodynamic impact (acute
onset doesn't allow for adaptation). Step 1 question was "Austin Flint Murmur."

Mitral Stenosis:                                                            Ortner's Syndrome

                                                                    left atrium

Mitral Regurgitation: The most common acute causes are endocarditis or papillary muscle /
chordal rupture post MI. The chronic causes can be primary (myxomatous degeneration) or
secondary (dilated cardiomyopathy leading to mitral annular dilation). Remember the isolated Right
Upper Lobe pulmonary edema is associated with mitral regurgitation.

Pulmonary Stenosis: Just like in           Williams Syndrome       K  Supra-Valvular Stenosis
                                            N oonan's S yndrom e      Valvular S tenosis
the Aortic Valve, comes in three flavors:                             Sub-Valvular Stenosis
(a) valvular, (b) subvalvular, (c) and                        TOF
supravalvular. Valvular is the most
common, and can lead to ventricular                    Pulmonary Stem퍀is Syndromes
hypertrophy. Associated with Noonan
Syndrome (male version of turners).
"Peripheral Pulmonary Stenosis" is
seen with Alagille syndrome (kids with
absent bile ducts). Williams can give
you supra-valvular aortic stenosis (and
pulmonic).

Pulmonary Regurgitation: The classic scenario is actually TOF patient who has been repaired.
TOF repair involves patch repair of the VSD and relief of the RV outlet obstruction. To fix the RV
obstruction the pulmonary valve integrity must be disrupted. Eventual failure of the valve (regurgitation)
is the primary complication of this procedure.

Cardiac MRI is used to guide the timing of pulmonary regurg repair. If the valve is repaired before the
RV is severely dilated (150 ml end diastolic volume) the outcomes are good. If the RV reaches a certain
degree of dilation- it typically won't return to normal and the patient is pretty much fucked.

Tricuspid Regurgitation: Most common                   Gamesmanship: -- Rheumatic heart
                                                       disease most commonly involves the mitral
form of tricuspid disease, due to the relatively weak  and aortic valves. Anytime there is multivalve
annulus (compared to the mitral). May occur in the     disease, think Rheumatic Fever!
setting of endocarditis (IV drug use), or carcinoid
syndrome (serotonin degrades the valve). The most      Step 1 Trivia: Rheumatic heart disease is
common cause in adults is pulmonary arterial           an immune modulated response to Group A-
hypertension. A testable pearl is that TR causes RV    Beta hemolytic strep.
dilation (NOT RV Hypertrophy).

Ebstein Anomaly: Seen in children whose moms used Lithium (most cases are actually
sporadic). The tricuspid valve is hypoplastic and the posterior leaf is displaced apically (downward).
The result is enlarged R A , decreased RV ("atrialized"), and tricuspid regurgitation. They have the
massive "box shaped" heart on CXR.

Tricuspid Atresia: Congenital anomaly that occurs with RV hypoplasia. Almost always has an
ASD or PFO. Recognized association with asplenia. Can have a right arch (although you should
think Truncus and TOF first). As a point of potentially confusing trivia; tricuspid atresia usually has
pulmonary stenosis and therefore will have decreased vascularity. If no PS is present, there will be
increased vascularity.

Carcinoid Syndrome: This can result in valvular disease, but only after the tumor has met'd to
the liver. The serotonin actually degrades heart valves, typically both the tricuspid and pulmonic
valves. Left sided valvular disease is super rare since the lungs degrade the vasoactive substances.
When you see left sided disease you should think of two scenarios:
(1) primary bronchial carcinoid, or (2) right-to-left shunts.
