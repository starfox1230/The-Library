MEN: "Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia"

There are three o f these stupid things, a n d people who write m ultiple choice tests love to

ask questions about them.

MEN 1:                                                    MEN Mnemonics
 Parathyroid Hyperplasia (90%),
 Pituitary Adenoma,                                             M EN I (3 Ps)
 Pancreatic Tumor (Gastrinoma most commonly)       - Pituitary, Parathyroid, Pancreas

MEN 2:                                                       MEN Ila (lM ,2Ps)
 Medullary Thyroid Cancer (100%)                         M edullary Thyroid Ca,
 Parathyroid hyperplasia,                          Pheochromocytoma, Parathyroid
 Pheochromocytoma (33%)
                                                       MEN Ilb (2Ms, IP)
MEN 2b:
 Medullary Thyroid Cancer (80%)                    -  M edullary Thyroid Ca,
 Pheochromocytoma (50%)
 Mucosal Neuroma,                                  M arfanoid Habitus /mucosal neuroma,
 Marfanoid Body Habitus
                                                       P heochrom ocytom a

                A Methodology to Remember MEN Syndromes

Each syndrome has 3 things:

M EN 1 = 1 Letter o f the alphabet which all three have in com m on is "P " so there are 3
P 's: Pi Para Pane (pituitary, parathyroid, and pancreas)

M EN 2 A = The A's : Adrenal (pheochrom ocytom a). A ggressive thyroid CA
(medullary) and Alot o f Calcium (parathyroid)

M EN 2 B: it is a wannaBe (it wants to be like A). So, it is the same (adrenal pheo,
medullary CA) BUT it has a b eef with calcium, so instead o f parathyroid, it decided to
B a Gangster (gangster for Ganglioneuroma).

                                               481
Carcinoid Syndrome:

Flushing, diarrhea, pain, right heart failure from serotonin manufactured by the carcinoid
tumor. The syndrome does not occur until the lesion mets to the liver (normally the liver
metabolizes the serotonin). The typical primary location for the carcinoid tum or is the GI
tract (70%). The most common primary location is the distal ileum (older literature says
appendix). The actual syndrome only occurs in 10% o f cases - and is actually very rare (in
real life - not on tests).

                             Carcinoid -Classic Mesenteric Involvement
Trivia: GI carcinoids are associated with other GI tumors (GI adenocarcinoma).
Trivia: Urine Test for Carcinoid = 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid)
Trivia: Nukes Test o f Choice: "*In-Octreotide (Octreoscan)
Trivia: M IBG is also positive - but less than 25% o f the time (like 15%). Gallium is positive,
but super non-specific.
Trivia: Systemic serotonin degrades the heart valves (right sided), and classically causes
tricuspid regurgitation
