                                                                     at the lateral border o f the rectus
Spigelian Hernia:
                                                                                  Above Arcuate Line
Also referred to as a                                                             Aponeuroses of the
"lateral ventral hernia"                                                          lateral body wall split
for the purpose o f fucking                                                       anterior and posterior
with you.                                                                         to the rectus.

The question is probably the                                                      Below Arcuate Line

line (""S ''fo r "S ") - which                                                    lateral body wall all
is diagrammed here as a                                                           move anterior to the
vertical dotted line                                                              rectus.
(white arrows) at the lateral
border of the rectus muscles.

They can occur anywhere along this line and still carry
the name "Spigelian" - but most commonly they are at
or slightly above the arcuate line (horizontal dotted line
with the black arrows).

Lumbar Hernia:

There are two types: superior and inferior - through their respective anatomic triangles.

        Superior Lumbar (Grynfeltt-Lesshaft)                     Inferior Lumbar (Petit)

More common than inferior                     Less common than superior

Causes are congenital or acquired             Causes are congenital
(post-surgery / trauma).                      or acquired (post-surgery
                                              / trauma).

Richter Hernia:

Contains only one wall of bowel and
therefore does not obstruct.
These are actually at higher risk for strangulation.

                                                                 Only one wall herniates

Obturator Hernia:                                                T

An old lady hernia. Often seen in patients                  Bowel herniating between the
with increased intra-abdominal pressure                     obturator and the pectineus muscles
(Ascites, COPD - chronic cougher,
Pregnancy).

Usually asymptomatic - but can strangulate.

Can also create a characteristic paresthesia along the inner thigh down to the knee (from
com pression o f the obturator nerve). This has a nam e "H owship-Rom berg Sign " - which sorta
sounds French to me, so it's probably testable.

Femoral vs Direct Inguinal vs Indirect Inguinal Hernia:

Internal Hernia: These can be sneaky. The most common manifestation is closed loop
obstruction (often with strangulation). There are 9 different subtypes, o f which I refiise to cover.
I will touch on the most common, and the general concept.

General Concept: This is a herniation o f viscera through the peritoneum or mesentery. The
herniation takes place through a known anatomic foramina or recess, one that has been created
post operatively or through the use of magical practices banned by the Brotherhood of Sorcerers
(goetia, necromancy, mutations on intelligent races e tc ..).

Paraduodenal hernias are the most common type o f internal hernias. They occur through
French sounded congenital defects (Lanzert and Waldeyer). The left one is way more common.

Gamesmanship: Classic history o f abdominal pain after eating which improves when the patient
massages their abdomen (gets better after a belly rub).

Left Sided (75%):
Occurs through a defect "The fossa of Lanzert" (L for Left)
in the descending colon mesentery / LUQ.
Classic Look: a sac-like cluster of dilated small bowel loops
(arrow) in the left anterior pararenal space, behind the IMV
and the ascending left colic artery.

Right Sided (25%):
Occurs through a defect "The fossa of W aldeyer" in the
ascending colon mesentery / RLQ. These are associated
with malrotation. The classic setting for right-sided
PDHs is non-rotated small bowel, with normally rotated
large bowel.

Classic Look: sac of abnormal dilated small bowel loops
(black arrow) on the right, below the part o f the
duodenum, and behind the SMA (white arrow) which
gets displaced anteriorly.

There are a bunch o f other locations internal hernias can occur (e.g., lesser sac /foramen of
winslow, pericecal, sigmoid mesocolon, small bowel mesentery, post-gastric bypass surgery etc)
- w hich you can google if y o u 're a nerd but in general they all follow the same pattern - a sac-
like cluster o f dilated bowel loops with twisted mesenteric vessels in an abnormal location in
a patient with symptoms o f bowel obstruction.
