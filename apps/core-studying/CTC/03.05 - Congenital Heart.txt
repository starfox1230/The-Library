                          CONGENITAL HEART

An extremely high yield and confusing topic which dinosaur Radiologists love to ask questions about
on CXR. Similar to my discussion in the thoracic chapter about examining the liver of a goat to
determine the will of the Gods - this is perhaps even more ridiculous (and therefore high yield).
I will now teach you to add confusion to a bad situation by suggesting a diagnosis on CXR instead of
waiting for ECHO or MRl. I will attempt to provide a methodology for single answers on CXR
cases.
My thoughts on multiple choice questions regarding congenital heart is that they will come in 3
flavors: (A) Aunt Minnie, (B) Differentials with crappy distractors, and (C) Associations / Trivia.

Aunt Minnies I Differentials:

There are a few congenital heart cases that are Aunt Minnies, or easily solvable (most are differential
cases). Bottom line is that if they want a single answer they will have to show you either an Aunt
Minnie or a differential case, with crappy distractors.
With regard to straight-up Aunt Minnies, I think the usual characters that most third year medical
students memorize are fair game.

                                                                                                              Scimitar Sword: PAPVR
                                                                                                                    with Hypoplasia

The easily solvable ones will be shown as a right arch with the associations o f T runcus {more
closely associated) and T O F (more com m on overall). Or, they will show you the big box
heart and want Ebsteins (which is an A unt M innie). A nother classic trick with regard to the
big box heart is non-cardiac causes o f high output failure (Infantile Hemangioendothelioma
and Vein o f Galen M alformation). The remaining cyanotic syndromes basically look the
same, so the questions must be either (a) crappy distractors (none o f the others are cyanotic,
etc...), or (b) trivia (which is more likely).

                              Trivia and Associations;

VSD: The most common congenital heart disease. There are several types with Membranous (just
below the aortic valve) being the most common (70%). Outlet subtypes (infundibulum) must be
repaired as the right coronary cusp prolapses into the defect. On CXR we are very nonspecific (big
heart, increased vasculature, small aortic knob). They could ask or try and show splaying of the carina
(from big left atrium). About 70% of the small ones close spontaneously.

PDA: The PDA normally closes around 24 hours after birth (functionally), and anatomically around 1
month. A PDA should make you say three things (1) Prematurity, (2) Maternal Rubella, (3) Cyanotic
Heart Disease. CXR is nonspecific (big heart, increased pulmonary vasculature, large aortic arch
"ductus bump"). You can close it or keep it open with meds.

ASD: Several types with the Secundum being the most               Syndromic ASD Trivia
common (50-70%). The larger subtype is the Primum,
(results from an endocardial cushion defect), is more likely   Downs Syndrome - ASDs in

Primums are not amenable to device closure because of
proximity to AV valve tissue. On CXR, if it's small it will    DiGeorge syndrome and Ellis-Van

AV Canal: Also referred to as an endocardial cushion defect - is in the spectrum of Ostium
Primum defects. They happen secondary to deficient development of a portion of the atrial septum, a
portion of the inter-ventricular septum, and the AV valves. Strong association with Downs. You can't
use closure devices on these dudes either. Surgical approach and management is complex and beyond
the scope of this text.

Unroofed Coronary Sinus (Coronary Sinus ASD): This is a rare ASD which
occurs secondary to a fenestrated (as in the cartoon) or totally unroofed coronary sinus. The most
important clinical is that you can get paradoxical emboli and chronic right heart volume overload.

PAPVR: Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return,             Sinus Venosus ASD
is defined as one (or more) o f the four pulm onary veins
draining into the right atrium. It is often o f m ild or no
physiologic consequence. It is often associated with
ASDs (secondum and sinus venosus types).

     · When I say Right Sided PAPVR + Pulmonary
          Hypoplasia, you say Scimitar Syndrome

TAPVR: Total anomalous pulmonary venous return, is a cyanotic heart disease characterized by all
of the pulmonary venous system draining to the right side of the heart - essentially a total eclipse of
the heart.

A large PFO or less commonly ASD is required for survival (this is a high yield and testable point).
I need you (PFO) now tonight. And I need you more than ever. And if you only hold me tight. We'll
be holding on forever.....

There are 3 types, but only two are likely to be tested (cardiac type II just doesn't have good testable
features). All 3 types will cause increased pulmonary vasculature, but type 3 is famous for a full on
pulmonary edema look in the newborn (every now and then I fall apart).

Type 1: Supracardiac:
  · Most Common Type
  · Veins drain above the heart, gives a snowman appearance.

Type 2: Cardiac
  · Second Most Common Type

Type 3: Infracardiac
  · Veins drain below the diaphragm (hepatic veins or IVC)
  · Obstruction on the way through the diaphragm is common
     and causes a full on pulmonary edema look

Transposition: This is the most com m on cause o f cyanosis during the first 24 hours. It
is seen m ost com m only in infants o f diabetic mothers. The basic idea is that the aorta arises
from the right ventricle and the pulmonary trunk from the left ventricle {ventricularterial
discordance).

Which one is the Right Ventricle ? You have to find the m oderator band (that defines the RV)

Just like TAPVR survival depends on an ASD, VSD, or PDA {most commonly VSD). There
are two flavors: D & L. The D type only has a PDA coimecting the two systems. W here as
the L type is "L ucky" enough to be com patible with Life.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF): The most common cyanotic heart disease. Describes 4 major
findings; (1) VSD, (2) RVOT Obstruction - often from valvular obstruction, (3) Overriding Aorta, (4) RV
hypertrophy (develops after birth). The degree of severity in symptoms is related to how bad the RVOT
obstruction is. If it's mild you might even have a "pink tef ' that presents in early adulthood. This is
called a pentalogy of Fallot if there is an ASD. Very likely to have a right arch.
Surgically it's usually fixed with primary repair. The various shunt procedures (Blalock-Taussig being the
most famous) are only done if the kid is inoperable or to bridge until primary repair.
Trivia: The most common complication following surgery is pulmonary regurgitation.

Truncus Arteriosus: Cyanotic anomaly where there is a single trunk supplying both the pulmonary
and systemic circulation, not a separate aorta and pulmonary trunk. It almost always has a VSD, and is
closely associated with a right arch. Associated with CATCH-22 genetics (DiGeorge Syndrome).

Hypoplastic Left Heart: Left ventricle and aorta are hypoplastic. They present with pulmonary
edema. Must have an ASD or large PFO. They also typically have a large PDA to put blood in their arch.
Strongly associated with aortic coarctation and endocardial fibroelastosis.

Cor Triatriatum Sinistrum:                              Cor Triatriatum Sinistrum

This is a very rare situation where
you have an abnormal pulmonary
vein draining into the left atrium
(sinistrum meaning left) with an
unnecessary fibromuscular
membrane that causes a sub division
of the left atrium. This creates the
appearance of a tri-atrium heart.
This can be a cause of unexplained
pulmonary hypertension in the peds
setting. Basically it acts like mitral
stenosis, and can cause pulmonary
edema. The outcomes are often bad
(fatal within two years), depending
on surgical intervention and

associated badness.
