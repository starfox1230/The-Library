This last section is a discussion on how to w eaponize your will pow er and stay m otivated for
the duration o f the training camp.

Attack by Fire

10-15% o f people will fail this exam. You must beat those people to pass.

No one has the right to beat you. I don't care w here you trained. I d o n 't care w here you came
from. No one has the right to beat you. When doubt creeps in you can go two roads. You can
go to the left or you can go to the right. You may hear people say "failure is not an option."
This is silly, failure is always an option. Failure is the m ost readily available option - but it's
not the only option - it is a choice. You can choose to fail or you can choose to succeed.

Self doubt and negative thoughts are the road to failure. I want to tell you this - as someone
who prides him self on both physical and mental toughness - it is normal to feel that way
sometimes. The vast majority o f people reading this book are perpetual winners in life, and
those kinds o f people hate to admit weakness to others and to themselves.

            You are not your accomplishments. You are not your failures. You are you.

Recognizing that about yourself gives you the power to overcome negative thought through
the awesome power o f hard work. Earn your victory. Deserve to win - the Gods o f War will
look favorably upon you. D on't hold back. Go 100% the entire time. You m ay hear people
say - "you look tired, you look exhausted." The worst feeling in the world is losing and
knowing that it was because you were lazy and didn't put in the work. I 'd m uch rather get
beat knowing I did everything I could to be prepared. "You look tired, you look exhausted,"
-y eah ... you bet your ass I 'm tired, that is the whole fucking point. M y goal is always to be
exhausted at the end o f each day. You want to feel like you got hit by a fucking freight train.
T hat's the feeling I like. T hat's how I know I 'm giving my best effort.

                        I train hard, I work hard, I fight hard, and I fight for victory.

I'm not afraid to feel pain. I 'd ju st prefer that other people feel it for me. In any com petition, I
want only one thing and that is to leave with my hand raised, at the top o f the podium, with
the gold medal - and I make no apologies for that. You shouldn't either.

    It is better to be a warrior in a garden - than a gardener in a war. Cultivate your warrior spirit.

                                                                  39
Tactical Dispositions - "S n a rl M o re "

Prior to entering the study environment - find a mirror
and make the ughest face you can.

Not a silly face. Not a sad face. A snarl.

A good snarl can give you what the Bible calls a
psychological edge.

People often confuse "nice" and "good" - they aren't the
same thing. The snarl is directed inward, that is why
you are looking in the mirror. That weak person inside
you - he/she gotta learn who is in charge.

Vacuity and Substance

Most people go through their lives trying to avoid pain.          Advice from My Father
This is a mistake. You are competing in a high stakes          What do you do if you get hit
contest. Pain is your friend. I f you can endure m ore time    and it really hurts?
in the study room relative to your opponents then you have     In a fight ?
an edge (Law 2). Once you understand this you w on't           Yeah, like if it really hurts
avoid pain anymore. Look for pain. Invite him in and have      Oh, that's good.
dirmer with him.

You don't look for me p a in .... I look for you.

This is a fundamental concept for developing the L ion's       Why is that good ?
heart. If you want to get somewhere in life - start by taking
stuff away. There is nothing you can add to your life that     If it hurts you aren't knocked
will make you stronger. Understanding this is something        out. Keep fighting.
you can take with you the rest o f your life.

At an early age, I was fortunate to learn the truth about despair - that nothing tastes better than
a bologna sandwich when you haven't eaten for 3 days. There is a reason why a guy like Julio
Cesar Chavez can win 87 boxing matches in a row, because the mother fucker grew up in an
abandoned railroad car w ith his five sisters and four brothers. You think someone like that is
gonna break when they get tired? Any luxuries that you are enjoying in your life - those aren't
making you stronger.

If you want to add to your life. Take stuff away.

Maneuvering the Army
Many o f you have probably had fairly normal lives with loving families and friends.
I imagine that could be a source o f motivation. W hen you feel that you are too tired to study,
or can't motivate yourself to enter the study environm ent, think about them. Think about how
much better things will be for them once you are making a real salary. Rise and Grind.
Illusion and Reality
For others, perhaps you have traveled a different path. N ot everyone has enjoyed a life filled
with good times and noodle salad. Some o f us were b o m in the dark, m olded by it.
Now, you are after something. It could be revenge. It could be money.
O r.... it could be something else.
Vengeance is a powerful motivator. Think o f all the people who have tried to stop you. Think
of all the people who have mistreated you. Visualize their stupid ugly faces smirking and
smiling when they hear you failed the exam. Let it boil your blood. Now picture those same
people making a face like they smelled a fart when they hear you passed the exam. You will
find that you aren't tired anymore. You are ready to train.
As a resident I went as far as putting a picture o f one o f my tormentors in my shoe. That way
every step I took I was walking on this person's face. Feel free to try that.

I have an oath that I read to m yself -especially when I'm tired, as a tool to harness my will. I
encourage you to modify the oath to make it yours. Hang it somewhere you can see it daily.
Perhaps beside a picture o f the person you hate the m ost in this world. O r... if you are less o f
a Sith and more o f a Jedi - hang it beside a photo o f the people you love.
