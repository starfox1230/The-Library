Lung volumes are low. There are bilateral gran-
ular opacities that represent collapsed alveoli
interspersed with open alveoli. Because the
larger bronchi do not collapse, there are prom-
inent air bronchograms. When the process is
severe enough and the majority of alveoli are
collapsed, there may be coalescence of the gran-
ular opacities, resulting in diffuse lung opacity.

Umbilical Arterial and Venous
Catheters

Umbilical arterial and venous catheters are com-
monly used in the NICU. Umbilical arterial
catheters pass from the umbilicus inferiorly
into the pelvis via the umbilical artery to the
iliac artery. The catheters then turn cephalad
within the aorta (see Fig. 3-5). These catheters
