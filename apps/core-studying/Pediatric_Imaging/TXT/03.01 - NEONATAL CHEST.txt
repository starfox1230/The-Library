Lung volumes are low. There are bilateral gran-
ular opacities that represent collapsed alveoli
interspersed with open alveoli. Because the
larger bronchi do not collapse, there are prom-
inent air bronchograms. When the process is
severe enough and the majority of alveoli are
collapsed, there may be coalescence of the gran-
ular opacities, resulting in diffuse lung opacity.

Umbilical arterial and venous catheters are com-
monly used in the NICU. Umbilical arterial
catheters pass from the umbilicus inferiorly
into the pelvis via the umbilical artery to the
