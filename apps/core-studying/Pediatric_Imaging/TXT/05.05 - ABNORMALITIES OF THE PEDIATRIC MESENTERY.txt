The mesentery does not have easily recogniz-
able boundaries on imaging. Therefore, localiza-
tion of an abnormality to the mesentery can be
difficult. The relative paucity of mesenteric fat
seen in the pediatric population can make detec-
tion and localization of processes in the mesen-
tery even more difficult than in adults, in whom
fat is typically abundant. The following criteria
are helpful in localizing a process to the
