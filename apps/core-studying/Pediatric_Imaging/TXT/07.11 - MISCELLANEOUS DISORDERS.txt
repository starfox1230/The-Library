examination is a common occurrence in chil-
dren. Most often, scoliosis is idiopathic in
origin; the following discussion pertains to idio-
pathic scoliosis unless otherwise indicated.
Idiopathic scoliosis is typically S-shaped, with
the upper (thoracic) curvature convex to the
right. Congenital scoliosis occurs secondary to
abnormal vertebral segmentation and is often
associated with more abrupt short-segment
curves than those found in idiopathic cases.
Neuromuscular scoliosis results from neurologic
impairment or muscular dystrophy and is typi-
cally C-shaped. Idiopathic scoliosis is usually
identified in late childhood or adolescence and
is much more common in girls (M:F = 1:7). In
80% of cases, diagnosis is made between the
ages of 10 years and maturity. The degree of
curvature may change quickly during times of
rapid growth such as puberty. Severe scoliosis
can be associated with respiratory compromise,
neurologic symptoms, and pain.
