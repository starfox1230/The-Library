     DWI has become a commonly used tool in
neuroimaging. One of its major advantages is its
high sensitivity for ischemia and infarction; it
often reveals them before such findings are
seen in conventional MR sequences. It is also
helpful in differentiating among posterior fossa
tumors. The hypercellular medulloblastoma has
restricted diffusion, whereas ependymoma and
astrocytoma typically do not.

Neonatal head ultrasound is performed through
the open anterior fontanel of neonates and infants
using a high-frequency sector transducer. Images
