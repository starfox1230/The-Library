disease.

TETRALOGY OF FALLOT
Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common type
of cyanotic congenital heart disease in children.
It is usually diagnosed by 3 months of age. There
are four classic anatomic components of tetral-
ogy of Fallot: (1) right ventricular outflow tract
obstruction, (2) VSD, (3) overriding aorta, and
(4) right ventricular hypertrophy. Radiographic
features include a normal-sized to slightly
enlarged cardiac silhouette with uplifting of the
ventricular apex (a superiorly oriented cardiac
axis) secondary to right ventricular hypertrophy
(see Fig. 4-6). The main pulmonary artery seg-
ment is concave because of the small associat-
ed pulmonary arteries. The combination of the

be the most severe form of tetralogy of Fallot.
It is synonymous with pseudotruncus or truncus
arteriosus type 4 because of the larger bronchial
arteries arising from the aorta and supplying
the lungs.

portion of the right ventricle. The age of presen-
tation is variable. When the anomaly is severe,
infants present with severe cyanosis. On radio-
graphy, massive cardiomegaly and decreased
pulmonary arterial flow are seen (Fig 4-13A, B;
and see Fig. 4-9). Ebstein anomaly is a rare
entity.

PULMONARY ATRESIA WITH INTACT
VENTRICULAR SEPTUM
Unlike cases of pulmonary atresia with VSD (tet-
ralogy of Fallot), patients with pulmonary atresia
and an intact septum have no forward flow from
the right heart. This leads to massive dilatation of
the right atrium and, to a lesser degree, the right
ventricle. Such patients present with marked
cyanosis in infancy. The radiographic appear-
ance (Fig. 4-14) may be identical to that of
Ebstein anomaly.

ities that may cause the appearance of a massive
cardiopericardial silhouette on the chest radio-
graph of a newborn. They include cardiac

Anything that causes the left ventricle to be

obstruction. The list of possibilities is long and
includes cardiomyopathy (see Fig. 4-5), glyco-
gen storage disease, anomalous origin of the
left coronary artery with associated cardiac
ischemia, birth asphyxia (shock myocardium),
infants of diabetic mothers, and hypoplastic left
heart syndrome (Fig. 4-24). Within the region
of the left atrium, both mitral valve stenosis
and cor triatriatum can cause left-sided heart
failure. Cor triatriatum is defined as the presence
of a membrane dividing the left atrium into
two separate chambers. The membrane has a
pinlike hole centrally that is the only route for
forward blood flow and causes relative obstruc-
tion. Pulmonary venous atresia can also cause
left-sided heart failure. The most commonly
encountered of these abnormalities include
hypoplastic left heart syndrome and coarctation
of the aorta.

     The second large category of entities
that can cause left-sided heart failure includes
systemic causes of failure, such as anemia
and polycythemia, sepsis, or high output fail-
ure resulting from a peripheral arteriovenous
malformation.

PULMONIC STENOSIS
In pulmonary valvular stenosis, there may
be dilatation of the main pulmonary artery
secondary to the jet effect (Fig. 4-26A, B).
On frontal chest radiography this appears as a
prominent main pulmonary arterial segment
