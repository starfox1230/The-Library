are essentially different spectrums of the same
disease.

TETRALOGY OF FALLOT
Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common type
of cyanotic congenital heart disease in children.
It is usually diagnosed by 3 months of age. There
are four classic anatomic components of tetral-
ogy of Fallot: (1) right ventricular outflow tract
obstruction, (2) VSD, (3) overriding aorta, and
(4) right ventricular hypertrophy. Radiographic
features include a normal-sized to slightly
enlarged cardiac silhouette with uplifting of the
ventricular apex (a superiorly oriented cardiac
axis) secondary to right ventricular hypertrophy
(see Fig. 4-6). The main pulmonary artery seg-
ment is concave because of the small associat-
ed pulmonary arteries. The combination of the

be the most severe form of tetralogy of Fallot.
It is synonymous with pseudotruncus or truncus
arteriosus type 4 because of the larger bronchial
arteries arising from the aorta and supplying
the lungs.

portion of the right ventricle. The age of presen-
tation is variable. When the anomaly is severe,
infants present with severe cyanosis. On radio-
graphy, massive cardiomegaly and decreased
pulmonary arterial flow are seen (Fig 4-13A, B;
and see Fig. 4-9). Ebstein anomaly is a rare
entity.

PULMONARY ATRESIA WITH INTACT
VENTRICULAR SEPTUM
Unlike cases of pulmonary atresia with VSD (tet-
ralogy of Fallot), patients with pulmonary atresia
and an intact septum have no forward flow from
the right heart. This leads to massive dilatation of
the right atrium and, to a lesser degree, the right
ventricle. Such patients present with marked
cyanosis in infancy. The radiographic appear-
ance (Fig. 4-14) may be identical to that of
Ebstein anomaly.

ities that may cause the appearance of a massive
cardiopericardial silhouette on the chest radio-
graph of a newborn. They include cardiac

Anything that causes the left ventricle to be
dysfunctional also can cause left-sided heart
obstruction. The list of possibilities is long and
includes cardiomyopathy (see Fig. 4-5), glyco-
gen storage disease, anomalous origin of the
left coronary artery with associated cardiac
ischemia, birth asphyxia (shock myocardium),
infants of diabetic mothers, and hypoplastic left
heart syndrome (Fig. 4-24). Within the region
of the left atrium, both mitral valve stenosis
and cor triatriatum can cause left-sided heart
failure. Cor triatriatum is defined as the presence
of a membrane dividing the left atrium into
two separate chambers. The membrane has a
pinlike hole centrally that is the only route for
forward blood flow and causes relative obstruc-
tion. Pulmonary venous atresia can also cause
left-sided heart failure. The most commonly
encountered of these abnormalities include
hypoplastic left heart syndrome and coarctation
of the aorta.

     The second large category of entities
that can cause left-sided heart failure includes
systemic causes of failure, such as anemia
and polycythemia, sepsis, or high output fail-
ure resulting from a peripheral arteriovenous
malformation.

PULMONIC STENOSIS
In pulmonary valvular stenosis, there may
be dilatation of the main pulmonary artery
secondary to the jet effect (Fig. 4-26A, B).
On frontal chest radiography this appears as a
prominent main pulmonary arterial segment
(Fig. 4-27).
