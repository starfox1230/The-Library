FIGURE 8-71. Tethered cord with associated hemangioma. A, Sagittal ultrasound shows the tip of the conus medullaris (arrow) to lie
abnormally low, at the level of L4. The cord and nerve roots appear to be taut (posteriorly tethered) and in a straight line and do not fall
anteriorly with gravity. No motion was seen in real time. B, Sagittal postcontrast T1-weighted MR image shows the abnormally low level
of the conus medullaris (arrow) at L4. There is also an enhancing mass (arrowheads) posterior to the sacrum, adjacent to the filum
terminalis, consistent with an associated hemangioma.
