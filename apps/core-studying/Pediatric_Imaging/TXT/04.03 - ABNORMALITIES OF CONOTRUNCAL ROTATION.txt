depicted by axial cross-sectional MRI. During embryologic
development, the primitive truncus is an anterior midline struc-
ture. With normal development, the primitive truncus divides
into the aorta and the pulmonary artery, which then rotate
150 degrees clockwise. The pulmonary artery then lies anterior
to and left of the aorta. Variations in this rotation are character-
istic of various conotruncal abnormalities. (A, aorta; DORV,
double outlet right ventricle; P, pulmonary artery; PT, primitive
