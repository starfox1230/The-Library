(10% of elbow injuries), the medial epicondyle
may become displaced. To avoid mistaking the
displaced apophysis for one of the other ossicles
of the elbow, it is important to know the predict-
able order of ossification of the elbow ossification
centers. The order can be remembered by the
mnemonic CRITOEcal (capitellum, radial head,
internal epicondyle, trochlea, olecranon, external
epicondyle). Whenever there is a fracture of
the forearm, it is important to evaluate the
radial-capitellar joint for potential dislocation of
the radial head. The radial head should align
with the capitellum. If it does not, radial head dis-
location should be suspected (Fig. 7-14).
