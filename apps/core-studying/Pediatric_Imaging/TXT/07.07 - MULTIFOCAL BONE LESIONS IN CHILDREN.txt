affects surgical planning. Surgery in conjunction
with chemotherapy is standard therapy; limb-
salvage procedures are currently being performed
in as much as 80% of patients. The 5-year survival
has increased to 77% in recent years. Often,
a course of chemotherapy is administered and
the patient is reimaged prior to surgery. MRI has
been shown to be useful in documenting chemo-
therapeutic response by demonstrating decrease
in the size of the soft tissue mass and the amount of
peritumoral edema. The most common type of
metastatic disease is pulmonary (lung nodules),
which is evaluated by CT. Skeletal metastatic dis-
ease is reported to be present in as many as 15% of
patients and is evaluated by skeletal scintigraphy.
