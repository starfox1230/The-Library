normal. There can be an associated increase
in cardiomegaly. Bone scans may show rib
infarcts. The children are treated with oxygen,
antibiotics, and pain control, and the pulmonary
opacities are commonly monitored by
radiography.

HIGH-RESOLUTION CT IN
CHILDREN WITH QUESTIONED
CHRONIC ASPIRATION

One of the more common indications for high-
resolution CT in the pediatric population is ques-
tioned chronic aspiration. Often this issue arises
in children with neurologic abnormalities such
as cerebral palsy or chronic tracheotomy tubes
when decisions about methods of feeding are
being entertained. High-resolution CT findings
of chronic aspiration include bronchiectasis,
tree-in-bud opacities (Fig. 3-36A, B), and
increased interstitial linear opacities. Findings
more often occur in lower lobes.

the genitourinary section. Approximately 15%
of neuroblastomas occur in the posterior med-
iastinum, most occurring before a child is 2 years
of age.

     Most neuroblastomas are visible on frontal
radiographs of the chest as a posterior opacity.
The soft tissue mass is often surprisingly poorly
visualized on the lateral view. There is fre-
quently erosion, destruction, or splaying of the
adjacent posterior ribs (Fig. 3-52A-D). These
findings may be subtle, so whenever a posterior
chest opacity is identified an effort should be
made to look for rib erosion. The neuroforamina
may appear enlarged on the lateral view, sec-
ondary to intraspinal extension of the tumor.
Calcifications are reported to be visible on
chest radiography in as many as 25% of cases,
although in my experience it is less than that.
Cross-sectional imaging with CT or MR imaging
confirms the presence of the tumor and evalu-
ates extent of disease, particularly whether there
is intraspinal extension. Thoracic neuroblasto-
mas have better prognosis than abdominal
neuroblastomas.
