FIGURE 6-36. Stage IV s neuroblastoma in a 9-month-old boy with palpable fullness in abdomen. A, Ultrasound shows multiple
heterogeneous hypoechoic masses throughout the liver parenchyma. B, CT shows left suprarenal mass (M). There are multiple low-
attenuation metastatic lesions in the liver. C, T2-weighted axial MRI shows multiple liver metastatic lesions more clearly and again
demonstrates left adrenal mass (M). D, MIBG study (oriented with left side of patient on left of image) shows increased uptake in left
adrenal mass (arrow). There is downward displacement of the left renal collecting system.
