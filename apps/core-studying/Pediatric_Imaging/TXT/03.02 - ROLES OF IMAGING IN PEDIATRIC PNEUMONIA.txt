tions for imaging in children. Because of the
frequency with which this scenario arises, knowl-
edge of the issues concerning the imaging of chil-

important. The roles of imaging in these children
are multiple: confirmation or exclusion of pneu-
monia, characterization and prediction of infec-
tious agents, exclusion of other cause of
symptoms, evaluation when there is failure to
resolve, and evaluation of related complications.

ination are also less reliable in children than in
adults because young children are less cooper-
ative with exams and have smaller anatomy and
smaller respiratory cycles. Because of the inac-
curacy of physical examination, radiography
is often requested to evaluate children with sus-
pected pneumonia. Several studies have shown
that in a large percentage of cases, findings on
chest radiography change caregivers' diagnoses
and treatment plans (antibiotics, bronchodila-
tors, and patient disposition) for children being
evaluated for potential pneumonia. At our insti-
tution, we obtain both a frontal and a lateral film

with age. In all age groups, viral infections
are much more common than bacterial infec-
tions. In infants and preschool-age children
(4 months to 5 years of age), viruses cause
95% of all lower respiratory tract infections.
The epidemiology is much different in school-
age children (6 to 16 years of age). In school-age
children, although viral agents remain the most
common cause of lower respiratory tract infec-
tions, the incidence of bacterial infection by
Streptococcus pneumoniae increases. What is
most striking is that Mycoplasma pneumoniae,
which is an uncommon cause of pneumonia in
preschool infants and children, is the cause of
approximately 30% of lower respiratory tract
infections in school-age children. Therefore,
the odds that a child should be administered
antibiotics for a respiratory tract infection are
greatly influenced by the child's age. In addition,
there has been a recent increase in the incidence
of pneumonia secondary to multidrug-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus infections. These can
occur at any age.

     Viral infections affect the airways, causing
inflammation of the small airways and peribron-
chial edema. This peribronchial edema appears
on radiography as increased peribronchial opa-
cities--symmetric course markings that radiate
from the hila into the lung (Fig. 3-21A, B; and
see Fig. 3-20A, B). The central portions of the
lungs appear to be ``dirty'' or ``busy.'' It is one
of the most subjective findings in radiology.
