fourth ventricle. The border between the mass (M) and the vermis is poorly defined (arrows). B, Sagittal, T1-weighted MR image shows
the mass filling the fourth ventricle. The poorly defined border (arrows) between the mass (M) and the vermis is more easily appreciated.

FIGURE 8-47. Brainstem glioma in a 9-year-old girl who presented with gait disturbance. A, Sagittal T1-weighted MR image shows mass
(M) within brainstem. The mass is relatively low in signal. The fourth ventricle (arrow) is displaced posteriorly. B, Sagittal T2-weighted
MR image shows homogeneous high-signal mass in pons. C, Axial FLAIR MR image shows lesion (M) to occupy the majority of the
pons and to be high in signal. D, Postcontrast T1-weighted MR image shows minimal enhancement of lesion (M). Note the posteriorly
displaced fourth ventricle (arrow).

FIGURE 8-48. Ependymoma in a 2-year-old child with headaches. A, Axial, noncontrast CT shows heterogeneous but well-defined mass
(arrows) with calcifications filling the fourth ventricle. B, Sagittal contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR image shows mass with heter-
ogeneous enhancement. The border between the brainstem and the mass (arrow) is poorly defined whereas the outline of the roof of the
fourth ventricle (arrowhead) is well defined.

Two thirds occur in the fourth ventricle. When
they occur in the fourth ventricle, ependymomas
arise from and have a broad connection with the
floor of the fourth ventricle, opposite from the
roof involvement seen in medulloblastoma.
Therefore, the border between the lesion and
the floor of the fourth ventricle is often poorly
defined (Fig. 8-48A, B). The lesions may fill and
grow out of the fourth ventricle via the foramina
into the cisterna magna and spinal canal. The
lesions appear very heterogeneous and enhance
heterogeneously on CT and MRI. They have
well-defined, lobulated margins. Calcifications
are seen on CT in 70% of cases (see Fig. 8-48).

bral tumors affecting children are glial in origin

These tumors range in appearance from well
circumscribed to infiltrative (Fig. 8-49). Imaging
appearance does not always correlate with histo-
logic grade. Less common tumors include embryo-
