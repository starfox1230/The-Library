DIAGNOSED HYDRONEPHROSIS

As a result of the increasing use of prenatal ultra-
sound, pediatric radiologists are more frequently
having to perform postnatal workups of prena-
tally diagnosed hydronephrosis. The evaluation
of such patients typically includes both ultra-
sound and VCUG. The controversy revolves
around the timing of the ultrasound evaluation.
In neonates, there is a relative state of dehydra-
tion that occurs after the first 24 hours of life.
Reports have shown that this relative state of
dehydration can lead to underestimation or non-
detection of hydronephrosis by ultrasound.
