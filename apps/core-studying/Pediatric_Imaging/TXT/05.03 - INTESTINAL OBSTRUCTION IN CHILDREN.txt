may be the first test of choice. CT is favored in
cases in which perforated appendicitis is highly
suspected, in evaluation for abscess, in postop-
erative evaluation, and in obese patients.

     The technique of ultrasound evaluation of
appendicitis is graded compression of the right
lower quadrant using a high-frequency trans-
ducer. Findings include a shadowing, echogenic
appendicolith (Fig. 5-27), a noncompressible
blind-ending tubular structure that measures
greater than 6 mm in diameter, or right lower
quadrant fluid, phlegmon, or abscess (Fig. 5-28).
CT findings include identification of an appendi-
colith, a distended appendix, periappendiceal
soft tissue stranding (Fig. 5-29), and wall thicken-
ing of the cecum or terminal ileum. In cases of
perforated appendicitis, findings of small bowel
obstruction may be present, and inflammatory
