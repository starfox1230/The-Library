Septooptic Dysplasia                                               B

Septooptic dysplasia is another type of ventral
induction malformation, analogous to mild holo-
prosencephaly. It is characterized by absence of
the septum pellucidum and hypoplasia of the
optic nerves. It is often associated with schizen-
cephaly, heterotopia, and hypothalamic and
pituitary dysfunction. In septooptic dysplasia,
the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles have
a squared appearance and point inferiorly on
coronal MR images.
