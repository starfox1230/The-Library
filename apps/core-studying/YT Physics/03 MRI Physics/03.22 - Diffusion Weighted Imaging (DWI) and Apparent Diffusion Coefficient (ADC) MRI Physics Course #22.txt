00:00:00.080 hello everybody and welcome back today we're focusing on diffusion weighted Imaging I want  
00:00:04.720 to show you how we can generate specific MRI images manipulate the data of those images and  
00:00:11.240 make assumptions about the underlying diffusion characteristics of the tissues that we're Imaging  
00:00:16.560 and in order to do this we need to understand the physics behind generating a b0 DWI and ADC images  
00:00:24.320 after this talk hopefully you'll understand how we generate these images what they represent and  
00:00:29.600 how they related to diffusion as well as why we can't look at these images in isolation and  
00:00:34.680 need to compare them to one another in order to make sound clinical judgments now in order  
00:00:39.880 to understand diffusion weighted Imaging we first need to understand what diffusion is  
00:00:44.600 now diffusion is the random or spontaneous movement of particles within a medium due to  
00:00:50.480 Thermal collisions it's what's known as brownie in motion and we can represent diffusion using a  
00:00:55.960 diffusion coefficient which is a product of a constant the boltman constant the temperature  
00:01:01.480 of the medium the size of the particles we're looking at moving in this Medium as well as the  
00:01:06.360 viscosity of the medium now when we're looking at MRI images we're primarily interested in hydrogen  
00:01:12.800 atoms it's the hydrogen atoms that are providing us with a signal that we use to generate our image  
00:01:18.440 now if we were to look at this example of a pure liquid where the particles can move at  
00:01:23.560 random in any direction if we were to sum up the movement of these particles in all directions it  
00:01:30.200 would be equal the net movement would be zero that's what's known as isotropic diffusion now  
00:01:35.880 when we look at the human body it's organized in a structured way Anatomy follows specific  
00:01:41.160 paths if you look at nerve fibers or muscles or bones there's limitations to how particles can  
00:01:47.440 move in those mediums and it's very rare that we get pure isotropic diffusion so if we have  
00:01:52.800 a look at another example where the molecules or particles are still moving with Brownian motion  
00:01:59.120 but they are Li limited by external structures here the net movement of these particles is now  
00:02:05.600 not going to be zero there's going to be more net movement from top to bottom than there is from  
00:02:11.120 side to side because of these limiting external structures a good example in the human body is  
00:02:17.080 white matter axon tracks where hydrogen atoms can move easily up and down the axon but find  
00:02:23.560 it very difficult to move between axons because of those cell membranes and the melin sheath now this  
00:02:29.840 skewed movement is what's known as anisotropic diffusion where we get diffusion preferentially  
00:02:35.440 in one plane as opposed to other planes now we can represent this using what's known as a diffusion  
00:02:41.600 tensor where we create a matrix of the diffusion coefficients in the cartisian plane where we look  
00:02:48.000 at the movement in the x- axis y AIS and Z axis as well as a combination of the axes now in isotropic  
00:02:55.440 diffusion our diffusion along the X Y and Zed axis is all going to be equal and when we compare those  
00:03:01.720 axes to one another these diffusion coefficients are going to be zero in anisotropic diffusion  
00:03:07.360 there's going to be a skewing of this Matrix and preferential diffusion in One Direction and we can  
00:03:13.440 represent this diffusion tensor in what's known as a diffusion ellipsoid in isotropic diffusion  
00:03:19.760 the diffusion is the same in all directions and we get this 3D representation of the diffusion  
00:03:24.840 in that medium in an isotropic diffusion you can see our ellipsoid changes shape here we get more  
00:03:32.640 diffusion say this is the y- AIS direction of our slice than we do in both the X and Zed axis  
00:03:38.720 there's a skewing of diffusion and that's what's known as anisotropic diffusion and this becomes  
00:03:42.960 really important when we look at diffusion tensor Imaging now there's a third type of diffusion  
00:03:47.880 which is also common in the body and that's what's known as restricted diffusion if we were to look  
00:03:53.400 at how the hydrogen atoms are diffusing within a medium that has many in this this example organel  
00:04:00.880 we're looking inside a cell here we've got mitochondria we've got endoplasmic reticulum  
00:04:05.960 and lomes and Gogi apparat it's been a long time since I've looked at cellular biology but the  
00:04:12.000 hydrogen atoms are not free to move here we could also have increased viscosity represented by the  
00:04:16.959 changing color here we see that the hydrogen atoms are moving slower than they are in these  
00:04:21.120 other diffusion models now there are multiple things that can cause restricted diffusion in MRI  
00:04:26.680 imaging and a lot of it relates to pathology if we have farction say in the brain we get swelling of  
00:04:32.120 cells we get a reduction in that extracellular space we can have increased viscosity such as  
00:04:36.880 in an absis we can have increased cellularity where the cells are packed tightly together and  
00:04:41.920 hydrogen atoms don't diffuse freely in that Medium such as in a lyoma a highly cellular  
00:04:47.240 tumor now the objective of diffusion weighted Imaging is simple we want to try and calculate  
00:04:54.200 how freely the hydrogen atoms are diffusing within the tissue that we are sampling and what we can do  
00:05:00.880 is represent that diffusion based on a grayscale here where restricted diffusion is represented by  
00:05:08.240 a lower numerical value and unrestricted free diffusion is represented by a higher numerical  
00:05:13.920 value and these numerical values is what we call the apparent diffusion coefficient the ADC that's  
00:05:20.200 what we're trying to calculate here now why is it apparent it's not the actual diffusion it's  
00:05:25.720 a result of an experiment that we run we create specific specific MRI images that changed based  
00:05:32.120 on the diffusion of tissues and we use that data to try and figure out what is the diffusion in  
00:05:37.320 those tissues what's the apparent diffusion in those tissues now remember this is what we're  
00:05:41.960 trying to calculate at the end of the day the ADC so how do we go about doing that well the  
00:05:47.760 first thing that we need to create is what's known as a b0 image and a DWI image it's the  
00:05:53.840 combination of these two images that we actually take using a pole sequence we use a combination of  
00:05:59.760 these images to create what's known as an ADC map this is not an actual image that we use a specific  
00:06:06.000 pulse sequence to create this is a mathematically calculated image that's why often your ADC map is  
00:06:12.200 very pixelated and looks very mathematical It's a combination of these two actual images that we  
00:06:17.600 create to create a mathematical formula that gives us the apparent diffusion coefficient within the  
00:06:23.040 tissues that we're looking at we don't have a specific pul sequence that can just spit out an  
00:06:28.280 ADC map there's no No Such Thing the only way we can create an ADC map is by creating a b0 image  
00:06:34.600 and a DWI image so let's look at how we go about creating those images and how they help us to  
00:06:39.640 create an ADC map the first image we're going to look at is what's known as the b0 image now you'll  
00:06:45.560 notice this pul sequence we've seen before this is an Epi an echo planer image what we've done  
00:06:52.040 is we created a spin Echo using a 90° RF pulse and a 180° refocusing pulse so in this example  
00:07:00.320 we creating a spin Echo here we rapidly fill case space using oscillating frequency encoding  
00:07:08.520 gradients coupled with additional phase encoding gradients and we can fill case space rapidly when  
00:07:13.960 we look at diffusion weighted Imaging we want to get a snapshot of the specific Anatomy that we're  
00:07:19.320 looking at and prevent movement within that image especially bulk motion if we got pulsating vessels  
00:07:25.440 that movement is going to obscure or prevent our ability to assess different diffusion because  
00:07:30.360 that movement is going to introduce artifact into our image and that's why we generally use Rapid  
00:07:34.840 sequences especially Epi in diffusion weighted Imaging now this b0 image if we look at this  
00:07:41.080 diagrammatic representation that I've made here the gray matter is lighter than the white matter  
00:07:46.280 in this image you can see this is a T2 weighted image and it's a T2 weighted image because we've  
00:07:51.640 got a slightly long te we've created space here and here in the pole sequence that we're  
00:07:57.200 going to use to create our DWI image now what is contributing to Signal here it's the differences  
00:08:03.640 in T2 Decay within tissues signal that is brighter here represents a tissue that keeps the transverse  
00:08:11.120 magnetization for longer than tissues that have darker signal here which lose their transverse  
00:08:16.760 magnetization more quickly so our b0 image here has created a T2 star weighted image now that  
00:08:24.720 we created a baseline image a T2 star weighted image we need to figure out how can we change this  
00:08:30.760 sequence in order to null signal or reduce signal coming from tissues that have high diffusion in  
00:08:36.320 them now in order to do that we're going to add another line into our pulse sequence another  
00:08:42.080 gradient we've seen we have a slice selection a frequency encoding and a phase encoding gradient  
00:08:48.040 these all help us to localize signal from our image and allow us to plot those signal values to  
00:08:53.880 create the MRI image that we're looking at now you can see this image has changed quite drastically  
00:08:59.320 and it's changed because of these two gradients that we've added in these are what's known as  
00:09:03.160 diffusion gradients now these diffusion gradients are much stronger than the gradients that we apply  
00:09:09.720 when we doing our spatial localization gradients and these diffusion gradients are going to help  
00:09:14.480 us to figure out how much diffusion is happening within the tissues so let's take a look at two  
00:09:19.840 separate parts of this MRI image first we'll look at a part where we know there's free diffusion CSF  
00:09:25.560 has rapid diffusion of water within the CSF it's r atively unobstructed then we can look at the  
00:09:32.160 head of the cordate where we know that's highly cellular we've got cell bodies we've got slight  
00:09:37.320 restriction of diffusion here and we can see that the cordate is brighter than our CSF here  
00:09:42.720 now why is that the case well if we were to look at the hydrogen atoms that are moving within the  
00:09:48.400 CSF they moving rapidly we flip all of our spins into the 90° plane into the transverse plane using  
00:09:56.120 this RF pulse those spins are going to lose lose transverse magnetization at a rate of T2 star now  
00:10:03.880 we know that they lose transverse magnetization and eventually we're going to apply a 180° RF  
00:10:09.800 pulse that's going to generate a spin Echo allow the leaders to become the laggers and catch up  
00:10:15.720 bringing our signal back up to levels of T2 if this is all looking forward to you I'd encourage  
00:10:20.360 you to go back to the spin Echo talks as well as the Epi talk now what happens if we were to apply  
00:10:26.760 a strong gradient across each one of these voxal we are applying a gradient across the whole image  
00:10:32.000 here say in the xais direction hydrogen atoms on this side of our voxal are going to now process  
00:10:38.160 at a slower frequency than hydrogen atoms at this side of our Ole we are going to get a frequency  
00:10:44.520 difference based on this large gradient that we've applied across our image now if these hydrogen  
00:10:49.600 atoms are moving freely while this diffusion gradient is being applied for a specific period  
00:10:55.520 of time the movement of the hydrogen atom is going to cause a change in frequency and that change in  
00:11:01.720 frequency is inducing a change in Phase now what causes signal loss it's def phasing of spins in  
00:11:09.360 the transverse plane if these hydrogen atoms were to move during this diffusion gradient we  
00:11:15.680 are getting a change in phase and we are getting a reduction in transverse magnetization the net  
00:11:21.280 magnetization vectors are still in the transverse plane but they are more out of phase with one  
00:11:26.000 another as opposed to if they stayed stationary if we were to think about spins that were staying  
00:11:31.760 stationary because there was some restriction to their diffusion there would also be a phase  
00:11:36.600 change across this foxal spins on this side will be processing faster than spins on this side there  
00:11:42.080 would be a net phase change and also signal loss but it would be organized based on the location  
00:11:47.320 in the x-axis here assuming that these spins aren't moving freely across this boxo we then  
00:11:53.280 apply the 180° RF pulse and we apply an equal diffusion gradient now because of this 180° RF  
00:12:00.800 pulse that diffusion gradient is effectively equal and opposite to the initial diffusion  
00:12:06.440 gradient now remember the spins in the restricted sample have stayed in the same location they are  
00:12:14.440 experiencing an equal and opposite diffusion gradient so that def phasing that was initially  
00:12:20.400 occurred because of the diffusion gradient is now equal and opposite and allows a reasing we  
00:12:26.920 will get larger signal from the spins that have restricted diffusion because they are reasing  
00:12:32.560 with this second diffusion gradient and we get a reaccumulation of phase back to Baseline and when  
00:12:37.800 we sample that signal with our Epi we get a signal that is similar to if we didn't have the diffusion  
00:12:43.320 gradient on now the hydrogen spins that are freely diffusing the gradient that they experience now is  
00:12:51.080 not equal and opposite because they have changed location within the boxo they may have completely  
00:12:56.440 left this boxel they may have completely left the slice and not contributing to signal so we  
00:13:00.960 get a rapid loss of signal here now the loss of signal represents the degree of diffusion that's  
00:13:08.200 happening with those hydrogen spins we know that when hydrogen spins move along a gradient we get  
00:13:14.320 a change in phase we actually get an exponential change in phase and that change in phase is what's  
00:13:18.960 causing the signal loss in our DWI image now the strength of this diffusion gradient as well as  
00:13:24.040 how long we have the diffusion gradient on as well as the time between the diffusion gradient  
00:13:29.080 is what's known as our B value the stronger the gradient the longer we apply that gradient and  
00:13:35.760 the greater the time between these gradients the higher our B value our B value is something that  
00:13:41.040 we input into the MRI machine the higher the B value the more signal loss we get based on  
00:13:46.600 the diffusion within the tissues and as I've said that b value is related to the period of time that  
00:13:51.640 we have the gradient on the longer we have that gradient on the more time there is for diffusion  
00:13:56.560 to occur and signal loss to occur in a freely diffusing tissue the steeper the gradient the  
00:14:01.640 greater the amplitude of this gradient the greater the differences in processional frequencies based  
00:14:06.600 on their location the more phase change and lastly the period of time between these two  
00:14:11.960 separate diffusion gradients as we increase that period of time there's more opportunity for these  
00:14:17.000 spins to move and not experience an equal and opposite gradient remember the spins that have  
00:14:22.360 restriction are staying in the same location so they experienc the first gradient they experience  
00:14:26.880 an equal and opp Opposite second gradient and allow for no net phase change to occur this B  
00:14:33.640 value is something we set it's generally between 0 and 1,000 generally 500 1,000 protocols change  
00:14:39.800 between different hospitals and there's no set B value that's going to give us the best image  
00:14:44.200 so that chosen by us and that b value you can see will manipulate the signal that's  
00:14:49.560 generated on this image now we've looked at this diffusion gradient in one plane now we know that  
00:14:55.440 in anatomical structures we don't have isotropic diffus diffusion we have an isotropic diffusion  
00:15:01.120 so we need to repeat this diffusion gradient the X plane the Y plane and the Z plane at a minimum  
00:15:07.200 the three planes of our cartisian plane to see if there's restricted diffusion along all of those  
00:15:11.920 planes now when we generate signal from this DWI image in all of our planes what is actually giving  
00:15:18.960 us signal well firstly we are running a T2 star weighted sequence here an Epi sequence secondly  
00:15:25.640 our B value is going to determine how much signal loss we get the higher our B value because this is  
00:15:31.880 a negative exponent as our B value increases the more signal loss we get based on diffusion now  
00:15:39.800 what we want to calculate as I've said before is what is the actual or apparent diffusion  
00:15:44.880 coefficient within our image how much diffusion is actually occurring in this tissue as there is  
00:15:50.840 more diffusion such as in our CSF here we get more signal loss again this is a negative exponent here  
00:15:57.600 we repeat this in all three planes and we're going to get three separate images these are  
00:16:01.800 what's known as our source images now in practice we may repeat the six to 20 different times but  
00:16:07.200 here we've got an example of three we combine the signal of all three of these images that  
00:16:12.440 we've created to create our DWI image this DWI image represents diffusion within the sample as  
00:16:21.320 well as the underlying T2 characteristics of the tissues that we are sampling here we're running a  
00:16:26.320 T2 weighted sequence a slightly longer te that longer te is because we need space for these  
00:16:31.920 diffusion gradients to be applied you can see it's still T2 weighted our gray matter is lighter than  
00:16:37.240 our white matter here now if something is bright what does that represent well it could represent  
00:16:43.480 the inherent T2 characteristics of that tissue or it could represent the restricted diffusion  
00:16:49.760 within that tissue there's not been much Movement we haven't got signal loss based on the diffusion  
00:16:54.440 gradients that we've applied and that diffusion or restricted diffusion is also a function of how  
00:17:00.680 strong our diffusion gradient has been that we've applied here the degree of signal loss  
00:17:05.359 is also a function of that b value there so now we've created two separate images a b0 image and  
00:17:12.000 a DWI Trace image where we've combined our source images this signal averaged image is what's known  
00:17:18.800 as our DWI Trace image and we've seen that the signal in each voxal here is represented by T2  
00:17:26.079 star signal loss is a fun of how rapidly tissues have lost their transverse magnetization bright  
00:17:33.080 tissues here lose their transverse magnetization more slowly than the darker tissues our DWI  
00:17:39.760 sequence each voxal here represents both the t2 waiting within the sample as well as the inherent  
00:17:47.080 diffusion within the tissues that we're looking at here now what we can do is mathematically combine  
00:17:54.560 these two images to try and isolate what is the apparent diffusion coefficient within our image  
00:18:01.200 you see this B image each voxel here represents the t2 star of that tissue in our DWI sequence  
00:18:09.440 here you can see we use T2 star the anatomy hasn't changed here our pulse sequence the only thing  
00:18:15.320 that's changed is this part of our pole sequence adding in a diffusion gradient otherwise nothing  
00:18:20.280 else has changed our B 0 image actually is the same sequence but we haven't applied a diffusion  
00:18:27.360 gradient our diffusion gradient is zero anything to the power of Z is one so we can effectively  
00:18:33.880 cancel out the diffusion component here we've got no signal loss based on our diffusion gradients  
00:18:39.240 in this image now what we can do between these two images you see our b0 image is in fact just  
00:18:45.320 representing the t2 characteristics of the tissues again nothing has changed between these the only  
00:18:50.960 thing that's changed is the strength of the fusion gradient that we've applied now when we look at  
00:18:54.880 our DWI image the signal that we're generating here it involves the t2 star component we can take  
00:19:02.160 the signal of this DWI image and divide it by the signal that we got in our b0 image as we take the  
00:19:10.040 signal from our b0 image and divide the numerical values of these signal we can see that DWI image  
00:19:17.280 divided by our B 0 image b0 is the same as T2 star we can cancel out the t2 contribution in  
00:19:24.440 our DWI image here we can get rid of signal that's coming from T2 and what we're left with here is a  
00:19:32.160 calculated image a mathematical calculation that is going to allow us to figure out what signal is  
00:19:38.440 coming from the diffusion within our sample here you can see now we can reorganize this formula  
00:19:46.160 here we know our DWI values from our Trace image we know our b0 values from our b0 image and we  
00:19:54.520 know our B value we selected the B value the only variable that that we don't know is our  
00:19:59.680 ADC our apparent diffusion coefficient of each voxel Within These images if we isolate ADC in  
00:20:06.680 this formula we can plug in the known values for each voxal within this image and we can create  
00:20:13.280 what's known as an ADC map you see this is a mathematical calculation and it fully relies  
00:20:20.720 on the DWI Trace images as well as the b0 image it's the mathematical calculation between these  
00:20:27.760 two that giving us our ADC image now remember in DWI when there was free diffusion we get a loss of  
00:20:34.000 signal when there was restricted diffusion we get higher signal the opposite is true in our ADC maps  
00:20:41.800 free diffusion now is represented by bright signal values remember as ADC increases DWI decreases  
00:20:50.360 because of this negative exponent the ADC values here give us some value to figure out how much  
00:20:56.640 diffusion is happening the more diffus Fusion there is the higher the ADC value notice how  
00:21:01.800 we've lost though that contrast between our gray and our white matter here the contrast here wasn't  
00:21:08.120 really due to the differences in diffusion it was more due to the differences in the t2 weighting  
00:21:13.560 of the image we have now negated that T2 waiting and we really struggle to see that contrast in our  
00:21:20.000 ADC image because the contrast here that we get is based on the apparent diffusion that we have  
00:21:25.160 calculated within the sample here the apparent diffus Fusion is much more in the CSF in this  
00:21:30.360 example than it is in these cellular components of our image that's how we go about creating  
00:21:35.560 our ADC map so let's look at a few examples to understand the underlying processes as well as  
00:21:40.640 Drive some of these points home now in our first example we can see that there is a lesion here  
00:21:46.680 that changes signal intensity based on the image that we're looking at in our b0 image that lesion  
00:21:52.720 is bright it's got a high T2 in our DWI image the lesion is also so bright now we know that  
00:22:00.080 in our DWI image signal intensity either comes from the t2 the prolonged T2 of that tissue or  
00:22:06.880 it comes from restricted diffusion now we couldn't look at this DWI image in isolation and say that  
00:22:13.480 this is confidently restricted diffusion because we haven't yet canceled out the t2 contribution to  
00:22:19.160 this image once we cancel out the t2 contribution by combining these images here we can see now that  
00:22:26.600 the lesion is dark on our ADC map remember ADC represents the apparent diffusion coefficient  
00:22:33.120 if the value is low there is a low amount of diffusion there is restricted diffusion within  
00:22:38.520 this Legion so our DWI image is bright because of the restricted diffusion and probably some  
00:22:44.800 contribution from T2 star here so this represents restricted diffusion now take a second example  
00:22:51.840 here where we've got a bright b0 image and we've got brightness in our DWI the same as the previous  
00:22:58.560 example but now we've got brightness on our ADC map now brightness on the ADC map represents free  
00:23:06.400 diffusion unrestricted diffusion if we look at our DWI image we see that there's brightness on the  
00:23:12.560 DWI image that we know can either be restricted diffusion or T2 star contribution prolong T2 in  
00:23:20.320 that tissue here we look at our B 0 image and it's very bright here we know that this Legion has a  
00:23:27.080 prolong T2 it has T2 brightness so this DWI image we have to look at in combination with our ADC map  
00:23:35.400 because alone we could say that this is restricted diffusion in fact this is what's known as T2 shine  
00:23:41.480 through the legion itself has a prolong T2 it's got a prolonged free induction Decay and that's  
00:23:47.520 what's causing the brightness in our DWI image it's not a restricted diffusion when we look at  
00:23:53.520 our ADC map we see that there is free diffusion within that image here so you can see how we need  
00:23:58.720 to look at our DWI in combination with our ADC and b0 image both of these examples we couldn't look  
00:24:04.400 at the DWI image in isolation and confidently say this is either restricted or unrestricted  
00:24:09.600 diffusion let's look at another example here we've got a DWI image that is completely clear there's  
00:24:17.400 no lesion on our DWI image now this is a reminder you can't just look at the DWI image and say if  
00:24:22.920 it's clear I won't look at my ADC map many times we look at the DWI image cuz our res resolution is  
00:24:28.560 much better the ADC map has really poor resolution it's very pixelated it's quite hard to spot the  
00:24:33.880 legion when you don't spot a lesion in DWI Imaging you need to look at the ADC Imaging and we look  
00:24:39.840 and suddenly there's a lesion there now what does this represent does it represent restricted  
00:24:45.320 diffusion that would be strange for it to not show up on our DWI image this is when we need  
00:24:50.680 to go back to the bz image and we see there is a low T2 value here now we are creating these images  
00:24:58.480 using echoplanar Imaging they're susceptible to many different artifacts especially susceptibility  
00:25:03.040 artifact we could get an artifact either in our b0 image or in our DWI image that doesn't represent  
00:25:10.000 the true underlying anatomy and it doesn't represent the diffusion characteristics of that  
00:25:14.360 tissue because we use these images to create our ADC map that artifact is going to come through in  
00:25:22.000 the mathematics it's going to show up in our ADC yet it doesn't truly represent anything to do with  
00:25:28.040 diffusion in this region and we can figure that out by looking at our source images so here we've  
00:25:33.800 got an artifact that's being propagated through to our ADC image one last example to really drive  
00:25:39.120 this point home here we've got a dark lesion on our b0 image again it could be an artifact but  
00:25:45.120 we see it's also dark in the DWI image all of our source images in our DWI average out have still  
00:25:52.480 created this dark region here what we've got is a legion that has a very short short T2 it loses  
00:25:59.680 transverse signal very quickly it's got a low T2 value the low value in our DWI image here is not  
00:26:08.320 representing diffusion free diffusion the signal has been lost quickly because we're still running  
00:26:14.400 a T2 an echoplanar image during this diffusion weighted image now we don't know the diffusion  
00:26:20.440 characteristics within this Legion is it dark here because of the short T2 times or is it dark  
00:26:26.720 because there's freely diffusing tissue in this region and when we look at our ADC map we get a  
00:26:32.280 confusing picture here I've represented it by this kind of pixelated region here the math here to  
00:26:38.200 create our ADC image doesn't give us information about the diffusion characteristics within this  
00:26:43.880 Legion and this is what's known as T2 blackout so hopefully you have a better understanding of  
00:26:49.680 how we create these specific images and what the signal intensities on these images represent I  
00:26:56.280 hope that you are convinced now that you can't look at a specific image in isolation without  
00:27:01.960 comparing it to the other images within the sequence I hope that hasn't been confusing I  
00:27:07.000 hope you have got more clarity when it comes to this type of Imaging many people get confused  
00:27:11.640 and remember if you are studying for a specific exam I have a question Bank linked below here  
00:27:17.120 you can practice your skills that you've learned throughout these talks you can figure out where  
00:27:22.040 you're strong and where you're weak and where you need to focus on prior to heading into the exams  
00:27:26.640 I don't want you to be thinking oh I wonder if this is going to come up I want you to be  
00:27:30.240 thinking when this comes up I'm going to say this go into your exam instead of with trepidation with  
00:27:35.360 confidence so that's all for today's talk I'll see you all in the next one goodbye everybody
