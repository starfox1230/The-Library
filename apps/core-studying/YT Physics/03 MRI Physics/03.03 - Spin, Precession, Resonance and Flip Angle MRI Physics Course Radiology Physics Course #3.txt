00:00:00.000 hello everybody and welcome back today we're going to discuss the phenomenon of nuclear  
00:00:04.080 magnetic resonance in the previous talk we looked at the various different magnets that  
00:00:07.920 were required to generate the magnetic fields in MRI imaging and we saw that certain nuclei  
00:00:13.440 responded in a very particular way to those external magnetic fields now that response is  
00:00:18.960 what's governed by nuclear magnetic resonance and in order to understand nuclear magnetic resonance  
00:00:23.880 we first need to understand a concept known as spin now throughout your studying you're going  
00:00:28.440 to come across two separate models the first is what's known as the classical model and the second  
00:00:32.880 is the quantum mechanical model now the classical model is more intuitive and it describes a Charged  
00:00:39.180 particle rotating around its own axis with angular momentum that movement of charge with angular  
00:00:45.660 momentum induces a magnetic field around that charged particle and the strength and direction of  
00:00:52.200 that magnetic field can be represented by what's known as the Magnetic Moment which we represent  
00:00:56.880 with this Arrow here the longer the arrow these stronger the magnetic field around this spinning  
00:01:02.100 particle now importantly this classical model is not actually what's happening within the  
00:01:07.620 particles within the body it's a good way to think about what's happening but these particles aren't  
00:01:12.720 actually spinning and you'll see this model will fall short when we describe certain phenomena  
00:01:16.680 later on in this course for example a neutron has no charge yet it has a Magnetic Moment an  
00:01:23.760 uncharged Neutron if it was rotating on its own axis it wouldn't make a Magnetic Moment yet it's  
00:01:29.220 what we observe in the physical world now how do we go about describing that Magnetic Moment  
00:01:34.200 within a neutron well we need quantum physics in order to do that quantum physics is a bizarre  
00:01:39.660 world it's less intuitive than the classical model and within quantum physics every property can be  
00:01:44.880 broken down into a discrete measurable value when we think about Quantum properties of an atom such  
00:01:50.880 as charge Mass color and now spin these are all properties that have distinct measurable values  
00:01:58.080 the way I like to think about it is looking at other Quantum properties if we look at an electron  
00:02:03.000 for example it has a Quantum property known as charge now charge is very difficult to describe to  
00:02:08.820 someone what exactly is charge it's very difficult to actually say what it is what it does do though  
00:02:14.220 is it describes how that subatomic particle will react to other subatomic particles we know that  
00:02:20.760 other subatomic particles with a negative charge will be repelled from the electron and we know  
00:02:26.460 that opposite charges will attract so the quantum property there has described how that subatomic  
00:02:32.280 particle will react to an external Force the same thing is happening with spin it describes types  
00:02:38.280 how that subatomic particle or that particle will react to an external magnetic field we  
00:02:44.340 call this spin value spin angular momentum and they have discrete measurable values  
00:02:49.260 protons for example like this proton here is made up of quarks two up quarks and one down  
00:02:55.140 clock which each have their own spin values and they are connected by gluons that hold  
00:03:00.720 those quarks tightly together in the proton the proton itself has a net spin value of a half  
00:03:07.020 and this spin value represents this spin angular momentum within the proton itself now you might  
00:03:12.840 be thinking that that's quite a difficult concept to get around we can't make an electron more or  
00:03:17.820 less negatively charged it has a set charge the same as a proton has a set spin in fact  
00:03:23.040 electrons have a spin of a half and neutrons have a spin of a half now when two neutrons are within  
00:03:29.100 the same nucleus they both have a spin value of a half but they have what's known as spin  
00:03:33.420 up and spin down the two magnetic moments are in opposite direction and cancel each other out  
00:03:39.360 in a nucleus it has an even number of protons and an even number of neutrons The Net Spin value of  
00:03:45.600 that nucleus will be zero those proton Pairs and neutron pairs would have canceled one another out  
00:03:50.640 and the nucleus of that atom would have a net spin value of zero now any atom that has a spin value  
00:03:57.300 of zero will be unaffected by an external magnetic field now if you think about the types of atoms  
00:04:02.880 within the human body we think about oxygen think about carbon and think about hydrogen now both  
00:04:08.220 Oxygen 16 and carbon-12 both have an even number of protons and neutrons and those even numbers  
00:04:14.580 mean that the spin values within those protons and neutrons cancel each other out in hydrogen we only  
00:04:20.100 have one proton there's no Neutron now that proton has a spin value of a half meaning the proton has  
00:04:26.340 its own Magnetic Moment and will be influenced by an external magnetic field now what I'm describing  
00:04:32.280 here is really only scraping the surface and if you want to understand this in more depth I'm  
00:04:36.300 going to link some articles and videos that you can read in your own time now those principles  
00:04:40.920 that are linked below the Pali Exclusion Principle the Heisenberg uncertainty principle  
00:04:45.180 the Schrodinger equation and entanglement all of those are far beyond the scope of this course  
00:04:49.920 fortunately when we're not trying to measure a single Magnetic Moment of a single proton itself  
00:04:55.560 but rather measure a group of protons we can take the net magnetization Vector the sum of all those  
00:05:02.460 magnetic moments and use that net magnetization Vector to calculate the MRI signal that we're  
00:05:08.040 generating and that net magnetization Vector acts very similarly to the classical model in physics  
00:05:13.440 and later if we come across a concept that is not explained by that classical model I will  
00:05:17.700 refer back to this quantum mechanical model to explain how those phenomena are occurring  
00:05:22.680 so why exactly do we use hydrogen well I've alluded to it in the first place there are many  
00:05:27.780 different atoms that will undergo nuclear magnetic resonance all of these atoms here have a net spin  
00:05:33.660 that is not equal to zero we mentioned carbon 12 and Oxygen 16 earlier these Isotopes because of  
00:05:41.100 the extra particle within the nucleus mean that they have a NetSpend value and will ultimately  
00:05:45.960 undergo a nuclear magnetic resonance however we use hydrogen one because it's the most abundant  
00:05:52.020 isotope in the body and two because the Magnetic Moment that vector-like quality of the hydrogen  
00:05:57.780 proton itself is the largest out of all of these Isotopes here it makes it a great candidate for  
00:06:03.360 MRI imaging and not only is hydrogen abundant but it's also abundant in various different tissues  
00:06:08.880 so we can compare tissues to one another now we've seen that the hydrogen proton itself has  
00:06:14.100 a non-zero spin value it's got a spin value of a half and because it has a non-zero spin value  
00:06:19.860 it will have a magnetic moment that vector-like property describing the magnetic field around that  
00:06:25.680 proton now throughout this course I'm going to refer to hydrogens either as free hydrogens or as  
00:06:31.320 protons because a hydrogen is just one proton or I will refer to them as spins all three of those are  
00:06:37.080 synonyms that you will see used interchangeably so when we look at the hydrogen proton itself we say  
00:06:42.780 it has a net Magnetic Moment now in fact in the quantum world that hydrogen proton can exist both  
00:06:48.900 to spin up and spin down States simultaneously and only when we go about measuring that Magnetic  
00:06:54.240 Moment can we say with certainty whether that hydrogen is spin up or spin down we should rather  
00:06:59.400 think about the net Magnetic Moment of a group of hydrogens where we submit all those little  
00:07:05.460 magnetic moments to get one net magnetization vector and that's why I'll represent a net  
00:07:10.500 magnetization Vector without the proton attached when you see a vector like this I'm talking about  
00:07:16.380 a group of hydrogen protons now the Magnetic Moment describes how those hydrogen protons  
00:07:22.800 will respond to an external magnetic field so it goes without saying that the Magnetic Moment and  
00:07:28.740 the spin value of the proton itself are linked in some way now in order to link the magnitude of the  
00:07:34.980 Magnetic Moment to the spin of the proton itself we use a value that's known as the gyromagnetic  
00:07:40.620 ratio now this is a value that's worth learning if you're studying for an MRI physics exam this kind  
00:07:46.920 of question comes up a lot the hydrogen atom has a gyromagnetic ratio of 42.5 megahertz per Tesla  
00:07:55.320 and if we times the gyromagnetic ratio by the Spin we will get a Magnetic Moment value here  
00:08:01.680 now you'll see later that the gyromagnetic ratio becomes really important when determining the  
00:08:06.660 processional frequency of those hydrogen atoms in a magnetic field now the gyromagnetic ratio  
00:08:12.900 as you can see here links a specific atom to that atom Spin and gives us the magnitude of  
00:08:18.600 the Magnetic Moment now we've said that when an atom with a non-zero spin is placed in a magnetic  
00:08:23.880 field that atom will align with the magnetic field and it will process at a certain frequency  
00:08:30.660 now the frequency at which that atom will process I've mentioned before is related to the strength  
00:08:36.900 of the magnetic field and the type of atom that it is now we can use the gyromagnetic ratio and  
00:08:43.620 the strength of the magnetic field strength in order to calculate what's known as the Lama  
00:08:47.640 frequency if we take the specific gyromagnetic ratio of the atom of interest and we times it or  
00:08:54.540 multiplied by the strength of the magnetic field we will get a frequency value that's known as the  
00:08:59.940 Llama frequency and this is a key principle in MRI imaging if we know the magnetic field strength say  
00:09:06.180 it's one Tesla and we know the gyromagnetic ratio of the proton or atom that we are trying to image  
00:09:12.660 we can calculate the processional frequency of that hydrogen proton that becomes really  
00:09:18.540 important because when we start adding that RF pulse we want the radio frequency poles to match  
00:09:23.460 the processional frequency if the main magnetic field strength went to 1.5 Tesla our frequency  
00:09:30.300 would increase by 50 you can see that multiplying a Tesla value with the gyromagnetic ratio means  
00:09:37.440 that the Tesla in the unit here will be canceled out and our frequency will be in megahertz  
00:09:42.600 now importantly what the Llama frequency is calculating is the processional frequency of  
00:09:47.700 the atom of interest in our case it's hydrogen now if you think about spinning a basketball on your  
00:09:54.000 finger firstly if the basketball wasn't spinning it would just fall off we need that angular  
00:09:58.620 momentum in order for that basketball to stay on our finger as it's pulled down by gravity and  
00:10:03.900 you'll see when people spin a basketball on their finger they move their finger from side to side  
00:10:07.980 ever so slightly in order to keep that basketball spinning you can think of that as the processional  
00:10:12.900 frequency if that basketball were to change if you were to make it a tennis ball your frequency  
00:10:17.340 would have to change the frequency is dependent on the type of atom that is in that magnetic field  
00:10:23.880 now as those protons line with the magnetic field we've said that some will be spin up  
00:10:28.920 and some will be spin down and there will be an energy difference between these two where  
00:10:33.120 the net magnetization Vector will lie parallel to the external magnetic field and we'll get  
00:10:39.060 what is known as a net magnetization vector as you can see these processing protons are  
00:10:44.700 processing out of phase they're at the same frequency but different phase because they're  
00:10:49.980 in different phases the X Y the transverse magnetization values cancel each other out  
00:10:55.380 and we have a net magnetization that is directly along the longitudinal or Z axis now if we take  
00:11:02.640 this net magnetization vector and place it within the MRI machine this should not be processing and  
00:11:08.460 I want to make this clear throughout this course whenever I show a net magnetization Vector that  
00:11:13.380 is processing within the MRI scanner I am not saying that this net magnetization Vector has  
00:11:18.720 any transverse magnetization yet what I want to show you here is that the hydrogen atoms that  
00:11:24.720 are causing this net magnetization Vector are processing at a set frequency the magnetization  
00:11:30.660 vector itself should be dead still because those transverse magnetization values are canceling  
00:11:36.540 each other out those hydrogen atoms are out of phase now this frequency becomes really  
00:11:41.160 important for when we want to induce transverse magnetization so we can calculate the specific  
00:11:47.280 frequency of the net magnetization vector by using the Llama equation here now once we've  
00:11:52.920 calculated that specific precession frequency we can apply a radio frequency pulse that matches  
00:11:59.460 that frequency that radio frequency pulse as we've seen is called B1 it's perpendicular to the main  
00:12:05.220 magnetic field if I'm spinning that basketball on my finger like this and someone gives a force to  
00:12:10.140 my arm perpendicular to the gravitational field I'm going to Fan my finger out in order to carry  
00:12:16.740 on balancing that basketball and the axis of that basketball is also going to change the same thing  
00:12:22.500 happens when we apply a radio frequency magnetic force at the same frequency as those atoms are  
00:12:28.140 processing energy will be applied into the system and that net magnetization Vector will be knocked  
00:12:34.020 off the longitudinal or Z plane we will gain some transverse magnetization now importantly  
00:12:40.860 this radio frequency pulse needs to match the processional frequency of those hydrogen atoms  
00:12:45.840 in order to induce this resonance now resonance is two things the first is it's applying energy to  
00:12:52.260 cause that net magnetization Vector to Fan out the second is that because the radio frequency pulse  
00:12:58.080 matches the processional frequency those hydrogen spins start to spin in Phase with one another they  
00:13:05.280 are no longer out of phase and because they are in Phase with one another we actually get a vector  
00:13:11.400 forming where we can measure the X Y plane or the transverse magnetization now importantly we only  
00:13:18.840 get transverse magnetization when the hydrogen nuclei are in phase and when they're in Phase  
00:13:24.660 they're undergoing what is known as resonance now if we apply a radio frequency pulse for a  
00:13:30.780 certain period of time we are flipping that net magnetization vector by a certain angle known  
00:13:36.540 as the flip Angle now at a flip angle of say 60 degrees here we will measure a certain signal if  
00:13:43.980 we place a coil transverse to our main magnetic field here and that signal can be read out the  
00:13:50.040 signal strength the amplitude of that signal is proportional to the transverse magnetization of  
00:13:55.740 those in-phase processing hydrogen atoms now if we apply that radio frequency pulse for a longer  
00:14:02.040 period of time that flip angle will keep getting bigger until it reaches 90 degrees that is when we  
00:14:08.040 get the maximum signal for our hydrogen nuclei the net magnetization Vector is now 90 degrees to our  
00:14:15.960 main magnetic field and you can see the amplitude of this signal is higher here so the application  
00:14:21.900 of a radio frequency pulse allows us to induce resonance resonance allows us to get transverse  
00:14:28.200 magnetization and transverse magnetization allows us to measure a signal now when we are looking  
00:14:34.380 at a gradient that's applied in the longitudinal direction we can calculate the specific frequency  
00:14:40.860 with the Lamar equation for a specific point along this gradient if we know the magnetic  
00:14:46.680 field strength here we will know that the Llama frequency will be higher for these hydrogen atoms  
00:14:52.800 along this X Y plane here the gyromagnetic ratio for the hydrogen atoms or hydrogen protons within  
00:14:59.460 the sample Remains the Same but the magnetic field strength changes that changing magnetic field  
00:15:05.940 strength changes the frequency of the hydrogen protons that are processing within the tissues  
00:15:10.920 and we can select a specific slice that matches that frequency and have a radio frequency pulse  
00:15:17.400 that selects for just that specific slice again the radio frequency pulse will only work if you  
00:15:23.700 are pushing it at the processional frequency if my professional frequency is different to my  
00:15:29.400 radio frequency poles they are not going to match up and that energy is not going to be transferred  
00:15:33.960 to those processing and now a resonant hydrogen protons so not only does resonance allow us to  
00:15:40.800 measure signal but it also allows us to select a specific group of hydrogen atoms based on the  
00:15:46.980 Llama frequency of those hydrogen atoms now what I've alluded to is that when we apply a  
00:15:51.780 radio frequency pulse it takes time for those now in Phase processing hydrogen atoms to gain  
00:15:58.860 transverse magnetization that takes a period of time if we apply a radio frequency pulse that  
00:16:05.280 matches the processional frequency for a certain period of time that makes that net magnetization  
00:16:10.080 Vector 45 degrees we will get a certain signal if we wait that exact same period of time  
00:16:16.500 continually applying that radio frequency pulse that magnetization Vector will now be 90 degrees  
00:16:22.800 we'll have gained maximum transverse magnetization interestingly this takes half the time to generate  
00:16:30.120 the signal but the signal generated at 45 degrees is 70 percent of the signal generated at 90  
00:16:36.300 degrees and we're going to come across sequences later where we need to measure the signal quickly  
00:16:41.700 and we need to use short flip angles we can't afford to wait all that time for the radio  
00:16:47.160 frequency pulse to get into 90 degrees and despite using small flip angles we are still generating a  
00:16:53.220 proportionally higher signal for the time it took to flip that net magnetization Vector 45 degrees  
00:16:59.580 now when we looked at the classical model with that actual spinning charged particle creating  
00:17:03.900 a magnetic moment we would think that the radio frequency pulse could only flip those protons  
00:17:09.240 to 90 degrees if we tried to flip in more than 90 degrees the magnetic dipole of that specific  
00:17:14.640 proton would be opposite to the main magnetic field and we wouldn't be able to push it past  
00:17:19.740 90 degrees now the quantum properties of a proton means that if we apply the radio frequency pulse  
00:17:26.040 for double the amount of time that it took to flip the net magnetization Vector to 90 degrees  
00:17:30.660 we can in fact flip that net magnetization Vector a full 180 degrees we've again lost all transverse  
00:17:38.400 magnetization but now this Vector is sitting in the higher energy state anti-parallel to the main  
00:17:44.520 magnetic field and this is because the proton can exist in both the spin up and spin down  
00:17:49.860 States and you'll see as we go on throughout this course there are multiple pulse sequences when we  
00:17:55.020 are required to flip the net magnetization Vector a full 180 degrees and and then we wait for that  
00:18:00.720 net magnetization Vector to return to its resting state and you'll see why that's extremely helpful  
00:18:05.940 when trying to generate a true T2 signal instead of a T2 star free induction Decay signal but  
00:18:12.240 that is for another talk I hope nuclear magnetic resonance has made some sense to you spin angular  
00:18:18.240 momentum is responsible for a Magnetic Moment within a proton that Magnetic Moment means that  
00:18:23.580 proton will align with an external magnetic field and process at a frequency that's dependent on the  
00:18:28.800 strength of that magnetic field and the type of atom that we're looking at and we can then  
00:18:33.180 use that processional frequency to apply a force perpendicular to that processional frequency and  
00:18:39.000 induce resonance within those hydrogen atoms that entire process is what's known as nuclear magnetic  
00:18:44.040 resonance so I'll see you all in the next talk where we're going to look at the loss of transfer  
00:18:48.120 signal once we flip that net magnetization Vector 90 degrees how then do we go about measuring the  
00:18:53.760 loss of that net magnetization Vector so I'll see you all in that talk goodbye everybody
