00:00:00.040 hello everybody and welcome back we've
00:00:01.680 made it to the final talk in this MRA
00:00:03.840 module now up until now we've been
00:00:06.080 looking at signal changes within blood
00:00:07.839 vessels without the need for the
00:00:09.880 administration of an exogenous contrast
00:00:11.799 agent now we're going to shift our
00:00:13.719 attention to contrast enhanced Mr and
00:00:15.840 geography we're going to see how giving
00:00:18.279 contrast will allow us to generate more
00:00:20.320 signal within blood vessels and we're
00:00:22.400 going to look at why we get more signal
00:00:24.080 as well as the type of sequence we need
00:00:25.960 in order to capture that signal now if
00:00:28.760 you've worked in m all you'll notice
00:00:30.800 that all of the contrast agents are
00:00:32.558 generally galum based now galum has a
00:00:35.920 unique property where drastically
00:00:37.960 shortens T1 times of tissues galini
00:00:41.200 generally stays in the extracellular
00:00:43.239 space within blood vessels it rarely
00:00:45.680 crosses membranes it's a large molecule
00:00:48.320 and it in itself is toxic it needs to be
00:00:50.520 bound to something known as a liand in
00:00:52.480 order to be able to be safely
00:00:54.120 administered to our patients now why
00:00:56.920 does gatum drastically shorten T1 times
00:00:59.480 well it's a unique atom in the way that
00:01:01.760 its electrons are configured you can see
00:01:04.319 that six electron shells are filled
00:01:06.600 within the galenium atom and we don't
00:01:09.119 just fill shells sequentially from the
00:01:10.920 first shell all the way out to the six
00:01:12.680 shell we know that there's a rule called
00:01:14.840 Huns Rule and it dictates the order in
00:01:17.320 which we fill electron orbitals now the
00:01:20.079 way in which we fill electron orbitals
00:01:21.920 means that there are certain orbitals
00:01:23.640 within the fifth and sixth shell that
00:01:25.680 are filled with electron pairs prior to
00:01:28.240 the 4f orbital orbital within the fourth
00:01:31.000 shell being filled with electrons now
00:01:33.840 the 4f orbital in gadolinium because of
00:01:36.200 the number of electrons it has will have
00:01:38.240 seven unpaired electrons the maximum
00:01:40.360 number of unpaired electrons that are
00:01:42.240 able to be within a shell those seven
00:01:45.240 unpaired electrons have a non-zero spin
00:01:48.079 value electrons in themselves have a
00:01:49.920 half spin value now normally when we
00:01:52.520 fill an orbital we fill the orbital with
00:01:55.040 electron pairs a spin up and a spin down
00:01:57.200 electron those spins will cancel each
00:01:59.200 other out much much like the protons
00:02:00.640 that we've been talking
00:02:02.200 about these seven unpaired electrons
00:02:05.119 don't have that canceling out electron
00:02:07.360 they each have a non-zero spin value and
00:02:09.399 as a result when galenium is placed into
00:02:11.720 an external magnetic field we get the
00:02:13.599 same phenomenon happening we get the
00:02:16.040 production of a Magnetic Moment we've
00:02:18.280 got a non-zero spin an external magnetic
00:02:21.080 field and the generation of a Magnetic
00:02:24.040 Moment now because there are seven
00:02:26.440 unpaired electrons and we've got a high
00:02:28.160 G magnetic ratio for these electrons the
00:02:30.800 galum in itself will be paramagnetic it
00:02:34.120 will cause a change in the magnetic
00:02:36.280 field essentially what's happening is
00:02:38.400 galenium will increase the amount of
00:02:40.840 spin ltis interactions will cause
00:02:43.959 hydrogen protons that have nuclear
00:02:46.080 magnetic resonance to start regaining
00:02:48.440 their longitudinal magnetization much
00:02:50.280 more rapidly importantly as well Gat
00:02:52.879 linium at high concentrations is also
00:02:54.920 going to reduce the t2 time it's going
00:02:57.159 to cause rapid def phasing but
00:02:59.800 predominantly the mechanism for
00:03:01.360 generating more signal in contrast
00:03:03.200 enhanced Mr angiography is that
00:03:05.159 gadolinium rapidly reduces the T1 times
00:03:08.840 so let's have a look at an example here
00:03:10.360 where we've got blood and soft tissue
00:03:12.760 what we want to do is we want to create
00:03:14.720 contrast between blood that will have
00:03:17.120 our contrast agent and soft tissue which
00:03:19.480 won't have our contrast agent remember
00:03:21.200 the contrast agent isn't getting into
00:03:23.159 the cells so if we give a contrast agent
00:03:26.599 what's going to happen is the contrast
00:03:28.000 agent will only be within the blood
00:03:29.760 vessels
00:03:30.879 ideally as we give that contrast agent
00:03:33.760 it's got galenium in it galenium is
00:03:35.560 going to cause an increase and spin
00:03:37.000 lattice interactions rapidly shortening
00:03:39.480 the T1 we can see how blood with high
00:03:43.040 concentrations of galenium is going to
00:03:45.040 have this rapidly reduced T1 time the T1
00:03:48.159 constants here have been
00:03:50.000 separated remember the T1 constant is a
00:03:52.560 Time taken to regain 63% of the
00:03:55.159 longitudinal
00:03:56.959 magnetization now if we were to have a
00:03:59.000 sequence that actually showed the
00:04:00.760 differences in these T1 times what type
00:04:02.760 of sequence would we need if we had a
00:04:05.079 very long TR time both soft tissue and
00:04:07.879 blood will fully regain their
00:04:09.360 longitudinal magnetization and we won't
00:04:11.640 get separation based on these
00:04:13.159 differences in T1 values so we need a
00:04:16.079 short TR time a short TR time is going
00:04:19.358 to prevent soft tissue from regaining
00:04:22.000 much longitudinal magnetization whilst
00:04:24.400 blood with gadolinium is going to have a
00:04:26.639 lot of longitudinal magnetization and
00:04:28.600 remember the degree of longitudinal
00:04:30.720 magnetization or the magnitude of
00:04:32.440 longitudinal magnetization will
00:04:34.320 determine how much transverse
00:04:35.880 magnetization we get at the next RF
00:04:37.759 pulse so we need a sequence that has a
00:04:40.199 short t r but remember gatum as well
00:04:43.160 also reduces the t2 times so we want to
00:04:45.479 have a short te we want to prevent it
00:04:48.199 losing that signal after we flip the net
00:04:50.840 magnetization Vector into the transverse
00:04:52.680 plane now the ideal sequence for this is
00:04:55.680 a gradient recalled Echo sequence now
00:04:58.400 remember gradient e EO sequences have
00:05:00.400 the advantage of being able to rapidly
00:05:02.639 sample tissue with short te and short
00:05:05.199 TRS and get a very heavily T1 weighted
00:05:07.880 image and this sequence specifically
00:05:10.160 we're using a spoiler gradient here so
00:05:12.639 what we've essentially created here is
00:05:14.199 an incoherent gradient Echo image we
00:05:16.800 don't have that stimulated Echo
00:05:18.479 providing signal here and we've got a T1
00:05:21.759 weighted image a short TR with a short
00:05:24.680 te now we haven't touched specifically
00:05:27.160 on 3D imaging comparing that to taking
00:05:29.639 multiple slices and stitching them
00:05:31.199 together but it turns out when we're
00:05:33.360 doing contrast enhanced Mr and geography
00:05:35.560 we use a 3D Technique we sample a large
00:05:38.840 volume of tissue and we use slightly
00:05:41.120 different slice selection gradients in
00:05:43.560 order to separate where that signal is
00:05:45.720 coming from and that's something we'll
00:05:46.759 perhaps touch on in a later talk but
00:05:49.400 doing a 3D image allows us to capture a
00:05:52.080 large area of tissue over a short period
00:05:54.280 of time speed here is of the essence the
00:05:57.080 galini is going to run through these
00:05:58.919 vessels quick quickly and only going to
00:06:00.360 stay in the arterial system for a short
00:06:02.319 period of time it's then going to go
00:06:04.600 into the Venus system and we're going to
00:06:06.240 get veins overlying our image here we're
00:06:09.080 catching it in a phase before the gatum
00:06:11.759 has reached the Venus system so if we're
00:06:14.319 trying to detect the signal at a
00:06:16.000 specific period of time we need to be
00:06:18.080 able to time when we actually acquire
00:06:20.319 the signal from when we give the bolus
00:06:22.560 to when we actually take the image if we
00:06:24.639 wait too long we'll get that Venus
00:06:26.039 overlay if we do it too quickly we're
00:06:27.919 not going to get the signal within the
00:06:29.479 system that we're looking at now there
00:06:31.479 are multiple different mechanisms for
00:06:33.039 timing this the first is we can give a
00:06:34.800 test bolus a small amount of contrast
00:06:36.960 and see what that does to the image how
00:06:38.720 long after our test bolus do we start
00:06:40.360 getting signal within the area of
00:06:42.199 Interest then we can give our full bolus
00:06:44.800 and do the same timing acquire the image
00:06:47.280 when we have our signal coming through
00:06:49.880 perhaps more frequently what we can do
00:06:51.400 is use what's called triggering we can
00:06:53.880 sample a specific volume where we know
00:06:56.080 we want signal and the Machine can
00:06:58.720 rapidly keep sampling this voxel here
00:07:01.080 and when we start to get signal coming
00:07:03.720 in that voxel a rapid increase in signal
00:07:06.039 in that voxel we trigger the sequence
00:07:08.080 and then acquire it and the last
00:07:09.879 mechanism we can use is what's known as
00:07:11.639 time resolved Imaging where we get a
00:07:14.120 real time look at the signal changes
00:07:16.120 within blood vessels here now this is
00:07:18.160 slightly more complicated because we're
00:07:19.840 not triggering when we want to acquire a
00:07:22.199 specific still image here we want to see
00:07:24.400 how the image changes over time the
00:07:26.520 temporal changes now the way we can do
00:07:29.039 that is by manipulating how we sample
00:07:31.400 kpace we can acquire without contrast
00:07:35.080 the region of Interest we can acquire
00:07:36.879 that image now the sequence that we're
00:07:38.639 using the gradient recalled Echo
00:07:40.120 sequence incoherent sequence we're using
00:07:42.120 here uses a very short TR it doesn't
00:07:45.440 allow this soft tissue to regain much
00:07:47.919 longitudinal magnetization prior to the
00:07:50.360 next RF pulse and as a result we get
00:07:52.199 partial saturation we get very reduced
00:07:54.520 signal from the soft tissue and we can
00:07:57.199 accentuate that by using a larger flip
00:07:59.440 angle the larger flip angle we use with
00:08:01.680 this RF pulse the less residual
00:08:04.080 longitudinal magnetization we have and
00:08:05.960 we really get a surpression of the soft
00:08:08.520 tissue signal now as we apply contrast
00:08:11.960 we are going to get high signal within
00:08:14.000 the arterial system here why do we have
00:08:16.639 high signal because with galum we get
00:08:19.560 rapid recovery of longitudinal
00:08:21.919 magnetization despite having short TRS
00:08:24.879 we still are recovering that
00:08:26.319 longitudinal magnetization and even
00:08:28.680 though we've got a large flip angle and
00:08:30.599 actually because we have a large flip
00:08:32.080 angle we're getting a lot of signal at
00:08:34.200 this short te here now if we were to
00:08:37.640 sample case space rapidly over and over
00:08:40.159 again we would have a lot of phase
00:08:41.958 encoding steps required for each image
00:08:44.320 that we take and that takes time each
00:08:46.600 additional phase encoding step here we
00:08:48.640 are adding time to our pulse sequence so
00:08:51.519 what we can do is lay over that
00:08:53.640 background image that we've taken prior
00:08:55.240 to having contrast and only sample the
00:08:57.720 center of K space if if you remember
00:08:59.640 when we looked at kpace the sensor of
00:09:01.839 kpace is what provides us with the most
00:09:03.760 contrast information it gives us the
00:09:06.320 highest signal differences between
00:09:08.160 different voxal within our image we can
00:09:11.160 rapidly sample the center of case space
00:09:13.160 using much fewer phase encoding steps
00:09:15.959 that allows us to get a real-time look
00:09:17.720 of how signal is changing within the
00:09:20.000 image and that contrast is going to
00:09:22.000 allow us to quite accurately do that now
00:09:24.839 obviously the more we try and get
00:09:26.800 temporal resolution the more rapidly we
00:09:28.720 try and sample the center of kpace we
00:09:31.040 are going to have the side effect of
00:09:32.600 losing some spatial resolution and it's
00:09:34.480 a trade-off there the more we sample the
00:09:36.959 entirety of kpace the better spatial
00:09:39.120 resolution we get but we get a loss of
00:09:41.120 temporal resolution now contrast
00:09:43.680 enhanced MRA has multiple different
00:09:45.800 advantages because we're using a 3D
00:09:48.120 technique here we get a good signal to
00:09:50.120 noise ratio and as I've said we get good
00:09:52.160 temporal resolution when we're looking
00:09:53.640 at something like time of flight where
00:09:55.240 we're looking at intrinsic properties of
00:09:56.959 the blood flowing into and out of the
00:09:58.680 slice we're not getting a real time look
00:10:00.800 of blood flow here we also have good
00:10:03.959 spatial resolution because of this 3D
00:10:06.200 acquisition and because it's a rapid
00:10:08.120 sequence here we sampling so quickly as
00:10:11.600 well that we get very little motion
00:10:13.720 artifact here we're not stitching
00:10:15.600 multiple different slices together like
00:10:17.200 we did in time of flight and these
00:10:19.360 images here are also less susceptible to
00:10:21.519 flow artifacts remember in time of
00:10:23.720 flight when spins travel through a slice
00:10:26.000 or when there's turbulence we're going
00:10:27.519 to get either saturation or loss of
00:10:29.720 signal and lastly in this technique
00:10:32.079 especially with peripheries we can image
00:10:34.200 quite a long section of blood vessels
00:10:36.120 without risking saturation with our time
00:10:38.880 of flight as we increase the number of
00:10:41.079 RF pulses that the blood is getting as
00:10:43.200 we travel down that vessel we might get
00:10:45.480 some loss of signal due to partial
00:10:47.560 saturation here we don't have those
00:10:49.720 effects because it's the galini that's
00:10:51.560 shortening the T1 and that's what's
00:10:53.639 providing signal it doesn't matter where
00:10:55.399 the blood is along the vessel itself now
00:10:58.560 obviously administering contrast or
00:11:00.360 doing a contrast enhanced MRA technique
00:11:02.880 comes with its own risks patients with
00:11:05.160 chronic renal disease or chronic renal
00:11:07.040 insufficiency are at risk of developing
00:11:09.480 nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and that's
00:11:11.959 something that has been seen in patients
00:11:13.880 who are unable to clear the gatum from
00:11:16.360 their
00:11:17.079 system we also have incidences of acute
00:11:20.600 reactions to gatum which are mostly
00:11:22.639 minor but there are acute allergic
00:11:24.680 reactions that can happen to galum
00:11:26.760 contrast either the galum itself or the
00:11:29.320 that it's bound to and with the
00:11:31.000 administration of galum we need to make
00:11:32.880 sure that our timing is correct from
00:11:34.680 when we give the bolus to when we
00:11:36.480 actually acquire the image if that
00:11:37.959 timing is off we're going to get
00:11:39.800 contrast enhancement in the vessels that
00:11:42.360 we're not interested in either in the
00:11:44.320 veins if we looking at the arteries or
00:11:46.240 we're going to get contrast or signal
00:11:48.200 coming from the Urus and the bladder
00:11:50.040 that going to interfere with our ability
00:11:52.200 to accurately create a diagnostic image
00:11:55.240 so hopefully you can see that the
00:11:56.600 administration of Gat linium and
00:11:58.200 whatever form it is is going to shorten
00:12:00.160 the T1 times where there is galum
00:12:02.920 generally within blood vessels you may
00:12:05.040 see in some neuroimaging that we get
00:12:07.040 breakdown of the blood brain barrier and
00:12:08.720 galum can seep into the extravascular
00:12:11.399 space it doesn't become intracellular
00:12:14.040 it's still interstitial but it's outside
00:12:16.720 of the vessels and where gadolinium is
00:12:19.000 in high concentrations it's going to be
00:12:21.040 brighter signals so long as our timing
00:12:23.000 is correct galenium is going to shorten
00:12:25.399 T1 times improve longitudinal recovery
00:12:28.480 giving a bigger transverse Vector at the
00:12:30.760 RF pulse and if we sample that
00:12:32.399 transverse Vector quickly before we lose
00:12:34.920 T2 signal before we lose transverse
00:12:37.199 magnetization we're going to get
00:12:38.800 brightness where gatum is remember it's
00:12:41.120 not gatum itself that's providing the
00:12:43.519 signal it's still the hydrogen atoms or
00:12:45.399 the hydrogen spins that are providing
00:12:46.800 the signal but they've gained
00:12:48.399 longitudinal magnetization quickly
00:12:50.519 because of those spin lce interactions
00:12:52.880 so that rounds off our M section it's a
00:12:55.600 large section there's a lot to cover and
00:12:57.800 each section of M geography has slight
00:12:59.920 differences slight subtleties and
00:13:01.320 nuances within it and it's important
00:13:03.240 when you're going into an exam to have
00:13:05.199 clearly in your mind how the different
00:13:07.320 techniques differ from one another is a
00:13:09.680 signal going to be dark within blood
00:13:11.199 vessels or is it going to be bright and
