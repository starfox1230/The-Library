00:00:00.000 so we've looked now at T2 relaxation and T1 relaxation and how those relaxation rates occur  
00:00:06.720 differently within different tissues and those differing rates account for the T1 or T2 contrast  
00:00:12.720 differences within an image today we're going to look at how we can manipulate the pulse sequence  
00:00:17.760 itself in order to preferentially highlight either the T1 differences in tissues or the t2  
00:00:23.940 differences in tissues and this is what's known as a weighting of an image we can create a T1  
00:00:29.400 weighted image where the contrast in this image is predominantly due to the T1 relaxation differences  
00:00:35.520 between the various tissues or we can create a T2 weighted image where the contrast here is because  
00:00:43.140 of the t2 relaxation rates that differ Within These different tissues and in the end we're  
00:00:48.840 going to look at a different type of weighting known as proton density weighting so to review  
00:00:54.120 we know that there are two separate relaxation processes happening simultaneously but independent  
00:00:59.820 from one another the first is transverse Decay or T2 relaxation spin spin relaxation where  
00:01:07.320 protons are defacing and we are losing the net transverse magnetization vector and that loss  
00:01:14.580 of net transverse magnetization Vector occurs at different rates for different tissues and it's  
00:01:20.580 these differences in rates of loss of transverse magnetization that accounts for the t2 differences  
00:01:26.520 within tissues and we know that loss of 63 percent of that transfer signal is what's known as the  
00:01:33.540 t2 constant and the t2 constant for each tissue will be different depending on that rate of loss  
00:01:40.860 the second independent but simultaneous process that's occurring is what's known  
00:01:45.660 as T1 relaxation longitudinal recovery or spin lattice relaxation here we're getting recovery  
00:01:53.400 of the longitudinal magnetization vector and again that recovery happens at different rates  
00:01:59.040 depending on the tissue we're looking at and the amount of time it takes to regain  
00:02:04.320 67 percent of that longitudinal magnetization Vector is what's known as a T1 time constants  
00:02:11.520 now when we look at these graphs it can be easy to think that these processes are happening at  
00:02:16.320 the same period of time and this is something that many people get wrong they think that we  
00:02:20.700 have a longitude no magnetization Vector that's happening here in the B naught plane and we flip  
00:02:26.520 that longitudinal magnetization Vector 90 degrees into the transverse plane many people get confused  
00:02:32.940 that the rate of loss of transverse magnetization occurs over the exact same period of time as the  
00:02:39.960 rate of gain of longitudinal magnetization that's not the case we lose transverse magnetization much  
00:02:47.340 quicker than we gain longitudinal magnetization because of those spins the phasing canceling out  
00:02:53.400 their X Y plane vectors and ultimately creating no Vector in the transverse plane whilst we're  
00:02:59.580 still recovering that longitudinal magnetization Vector you can see here the t2 time for CSF is  
00:03:05.400 roughly 160 milliseconds the T1 time for CSF is 2000 200 milliseconds it takes much longer to  
00:03:14.820 regain that longitudinal magnetization Vector so I can't actually fit this into my slide if  
00:03:20.940 these were still to scale this T2 relaxation would end about here T2 relaxation happens very  
00:03:28.140 quickly when you compare it to T1 or longitudinal recovery now we have a basic pulse sequence here  
00:03:34.860 with two parameters that we can change and we've looked at these two parameters the time of Echo  
00:03:40.020 and the time of repetition the time of echo is the amount of time that we wait after the RF pulse to  
00:03:46.500 then sample that transverse magnetization signal in the coil in our MRI machine  
00:03:51.720 and we can change this time of Echo and we've seen that changing the time to Echo will highlight the  
00:03:57.540 t2 differences within tissues then we wait a longer period of time while those tissues  
00:04:03.120 are gaining longitudinal recovery until we then flip again with our RF pulse the time between the  
00:04:09.420 first RF pulse and the next RF pulse is what's known as the time of repetition and we've seen  
00:04:14.280 that the time of repetition determines the amount of T1 contrast that is going to contribute to our  
00:04:19.680 images so let's review these two processes we've got time of echo where we're looking at the t2  
00:04:25.320 relaxation within our tissues we see initially assuming that all of these tissues have the same  
00:04:30.900 number of protons in them that they all start with maximum transverse magnetization signal now this  
00:04:37.020 is another point that we have yet to cover on fully when we apply the B naught pulse to all  
00:04:42.660 these tissues in our example so far we've assumed that the number of free hydrogen protons that are  
00:04:48.720 able to exhibit nuclear magnetic resonance in CSF is the same as what's in muscle we've assumed that  
00:04:55.080 this longitudinal magnetization Vector is exactly the same between these two tissues and it's the  
00:05:00.900 magnitude of this longitudinal magnetization Vector that will determine the magnitude of the  
00:05:06.000 transverse magnetization Vector this Vector in the longitudinal plane prior to the 90 degree RF pulse  
00:05:12.180 will determine the vector in the transverse plane after the 90 degree RF bars now in reality there  
00:05:18.480 are more hydrogen free hydrogen atoms available in cs7 fat than there is in muscle and when we  
00:05:24.480 look at that longitudinal magnetization Vector the muscle longitudinal magnetization Vector will be  
00:05:30.420 less than the CSF in fat and when we flip at 90 degrees we are starting with a lower signal now  
00:05:36.300 for our examples we are assuming that the number of protons available is equal and we are starting  
00:05:41.400 these vectors these transverse vectors at the same point here now if we were to select a short time  
00:05:47.640 of echo what kind of contrast would we get in the image we will get high signal but we will get very  
00:05:53.640 little contrast because all of those transverse magnetization vectors have yet to exhibit T2  
00:05:59.040 relaxation if we wait slightly longer and measure the sample at a te with a longer te we can see now  
00:06:06.480 we've highlighted the differences in transverse relaxation or transverse decay in these tissues  
00:06:12.900 transverse or T2 relaxation happens much slower in CSF than it does in fat and it does in muscle  
00:06:18.840 we can see that this signal coming from muscle is much less than that of fat and the signal  
00:06:23.520 coming from fat is less than that of CSF by increasing the te time we have highlighted  
00:06:28.920 the t2 differences in the tissue and again if we wait an even longer time to Echo we then  
00:06:34.560 lose contrast as well as losing signal this is useless to us because we're not getting  
00:06:39.240 any signal and we're not getting any contrast and when we look at the time of repetition the  
00:06:44.100 time we take to allow those spins to start gaining their longitudinal magnetization before flipping  
00:06:49.740 them again we see that their time of repetition change will highlight the T1 differences within  
00:06:54.900 the tissues so we can either choose a short time of repetition or a long time of repetition  
00:07:00.660 so let's see what happens when we have a short time of repetition we can see that the tissues  
00:07:06.420 haven't regained fully their longitudinal magnetization and if we sample that tissue  
00:07:12.900 immediately after the 90 degree RF pulse we have a short te here the differences in these tissues  
00:07:19.440 is going to be predominantly because of the T1 differences if we again look at fat and we look at  
00:07:24.900 water and wait only a short period of time before flipping the next 90 degree rfos what exactly  
00:07:31.800 happens fat regains the longitudinal magnetization much faster than water does or CSF does so at this  
00:07:40.800 TR here fat has regained much more longitudinal magnetization in the z-axis here than water has  
00:07:47.040 remember at this period of time here we fully lost our transverse magnetization Vector because  
00:07:52.740 these spins are out of phase with one another in CSF and in fact so our actual magnetization  
00:07:59.160 Vector here won't have any transverse component we will only have the longitudinal components of  
00:08:04.860 these magnetization vectors so for CSF it will be around here and for fact it'll be around here  
00:08:10.320 the degree or the magnitude of that longitudinal magnetization Vector in the longitudinal plane  
00:08:16.440 prior to this RF pulse here our TR is going to determine the magnitude of that transverse  
00:08:23.220 magnetization Vector you can see here that water if CSF is starting at a much lower transverse  
00:08:29.820 magnetization than fat is and that's because it hasn't regained much longitudinal magnetization  
00:08:35.039 here and that highlights the T1 differences in our tissues if we wait for a longer TR you see we wait  
00:08:42.299 to regain all of that longitudinal magnetization Vector in the various different tissues prior to  
00:08:48.780 flipping 90 degrees we can see that then we lose that T1 contrast if we sample here at a short te  
00:08:55.860 we've got no contrast but High signal between the tissues so let's have a look at an example where  
00:09:01.320 we have a long TR and a short t e we've negated the T1 differences and negated the t2 differences  
00:09:08.580 within null tissue this is the most basic pulse sequence that we can have a short te and a long  
00:09:15.240 TR with just one 90 degree RF pulse and only one time of echo what we've created here is a high  
00:09:22.440 signal from the longitudinal magnetization Vector we've allowed all the tissues to have a large  
00:09:27.060 longitudinal magnetization Vector then flip them 90 degrees and Sample straight away not allowing  
00:09:33.180 any of the t2 differences to occur within this tissue if we wanted to take this sequence and  
00:09:38.760 create a T1 weighted image where the contrast in the image is predominantly from the T1 relaxation  
00:09:45.000 differences within the tissue what do we need to do to this pulse sequence we want to keep the t2  
00:09:50.940 contrast out of the image so we want to keep the te time short so we don't allow any time  
00:09:57.660 for those T2 differences to occur the transverse relaxation to occur we don't want that to happen  
00:10:03.480 so we keep the te short we want to highlight the differences in T1 between the tissues so we want  
00:10:09.960 to reduce this TR time so look what happens I'm going to slide this TR time along and look what  
00:10:16.380 happens to the contrast in the tissues as well as look what happens to this transverse magnetization  
00:10:21.780 Vector here we've seen that because those lower TR times don't allow for that full  
00:10:27.420 recovery of the longitudinal magnetization Vector they're ultimately going to affect the transverse  
00:10:32.220 magnetization Vector after that 90 degree RF pulse so look closely here as we reduce that TR time  
00:10:38.820 look at the contrast that we've now generated within our image we know that this contrast  
00:10:44.340 isn't due to T2 differences because we've got a very short te it's predominantly due to the T1  
00:10:50.520 differences in the tissues here the differential rates of longitudinal recovery those differing  
00:10:56.760 z-axis longitudinal magnetization vectors prior to the 90 degree RF flip that difference now that  
00:11:03.600 we're measuring at this te is because of the T1 differences in tissues and you can see now that  
00:11:09.600 our TR values are much lower than that 2000 value that we were looking at earlier they're in the 300  
00:11:15.120 to 600 milliseconds so we've got a short TR and a very short t e in the 10 to 30 milliseconds range  
00:11:22.380 and this is going to create what's known as a T1 weighted image here we can see that the CSF  
00:11:27.780 is dark and that's because of this longitudinal magnetization Vector having not gained very much  
00:11:33.120 vector magnitude here we've got a lower CSF signal intensity then we do fat intensity look how bright  
00:11:39.120 the subcutaneous fat is in this image and we can see we've got intermediate signal from the  
00:11:43.980 muscles here muscles a bit lying between the CSF and the fat and this contrast is based on the T1  
00:11:50.280 differences in our image so now let's move back to that low T1 contrast low T2 contrast but High  
00:11:57.060 signal if we want to bring out the t2 differences within this image we want to create a T2 weighted  
00:12:02.760 image we want to keep this TR along we've got high signal and very little T1 differences between the  
00:12:08.700 tissues at a very low TR there's very little difference in contrast between the t1s but also  
00:12:15.360 extremely low signal here we can't use very low TR values we need to use long TR values then if we  
00:12:22.560 want to highlight the t2 differences what we need to do is increase that te time and as we increase  
00:12:28.680 the te time we highlight the differences in T2 relaxation transverse Decay within the various  
00:12:35.580 different tissues and we see that T2 relaxation happens much slower in water than it does in fat  
00:12:41.040 and it does in muscle and we created a different pattern of contrast here which is based on the t2  
00:12:46.380 differences within our tissue we've kept the TR along at 2 000 milliseconds and we've increased  
00:12:52.380 the length of the te so we've got a long TR and a long te now te is now 80 to 140 milliseconds  
00:12:59.220 what we've created here is a T2 weighted image where the CSF now is bright the fat has got more  
00:13:06.000 intermediate signal and our muscle has got low signal intensity here now you might be wondering  
00:13:11.700 this CSF looks like a fairly low signal why is the CSF so bright compared to the effect here  
00:13:17.400 now this comes back to the fact that the actual number of free hydrogen protons that are available  
00:13:22.500 for nuclear magnetic resonance is higher in CSF in fact than it is in other tissues like muscle  
00:13:28.140 or connective tissue so this y value here in the transverse magnetization plane we are not  
00:13:35.100 accounting for those absolute number of proton differences so when we wait a long TR period of  
00:13:40.980 time here the fat and CSF will gain a large Vector our muscle Vector here will be smaller just based  
00:13:47.100 purely on the number of protons that are available for nuclear magnetic resonance and when we flip  
00:13:52.320 90 degrees and wait for those T2 differences to occur we're going to be starting from different  
00:13:56.940 transverse magnetization vectors here must muscle will actually be much lower and CSF and fat will  
00:14:02.220 be much higher and that's why we've got brightness here but it's clear to see here that the CSF is so  
00:14:07.560 much brighter in a T2 weighted image a purity two weighted image than it is in a T1 weighted  
00:14:12.540 image and that's because of the different t e and TR times in our pulse sequence now let's go back  
00:14:18.480 to this pulse sequence that we keep referring back to where we've got a long TR very little  
00:14:23.400 T1 differences and a short t e very little t e differences the difference is now in contrast  
00:14:30.300 in the tissues are going to be purely based on the number of protons that are available for  
00:14:34.800 nuclear magnetic resonance we wait a long time to repetition and the differences in the longitudinal  
00:14:41.040 magnetization Vector here will be purely based on the number of hydrogens that are available  
00:14:45.780 to exhibit nuclear magnetic resonance those differences in the longitudinal magnetization  
00:14:51.900 Vector between the different tissues are purely based on the number of protons and when we flip  
00:14:56.460 it 90 degrees with the RF pulse those different is in transverse magnetization vectors are going  
00:15:02.220 to be purely because of the differences in the number of protons available for nuclear magnetic  
00:15:07.320 resonance within that specific voxel if we sample that tissue straight away we haven't allowed those  
00:15:13.080 T2 differences to occur and what we've created here is contrast within our image purely based  
00:15:19.620 on the proton density within the image and that's what's created a proton density weighted image you  
00:15:25.800 can see that fat signal is bright we can see the synovial fluid here water signal is also  
00:15:31.080 bright that's because fats and fluid have the highest density of protons available to exhibit  
00:15:36.120 nuclear magnetic resonance we can see that we get great contrast within our image again if we were  
00:15:42.360 looking at this T2 relaxation curve we would think that our muscle signal would be bright  
00:15:47.760 when we look at the muscles in this image we've got an intermediate signal here that's because  
00:15:52.800 as I've mentioned now multiple times this muscle signal doesn't start with such a large transverse  
00:15:58.200 magnetization vector it because it's longitudinal magnetization Vector was comparatively small  
00:16:03.840 compared to muscle and fat and when we flipped at 90 degrees it's starting at a lower y-axis value  
00:16:09.720 here on our T2 relaxation curves and that's why we get an intermediate muscle signal this red line  
00:16:16.140 should actually be lower down on our T2 relaxation curve you can see that we get excellent contrast  
00:16:22.260 in this image we get very low signal from the menisci low signal from the ligaments here as  
00:16:29.220 well as the subchondral bone plates we can see clearly the differences between the bright fluid  
00:16:34.920 bright fat and those darker structures and we can see clearly the articular cartilage here  
00:16:40.920 now later on when we look at more advanced pulse sequences we can see how we'll be able to negate  
00:16:46.440 the signal from the fattier only having bright signal coming from water and that allows us to  
00:16:52.200 much more easily identify tears in ligaments or in the meniscus here by seeing that contrast between  
00:16:57.720 the bright fluid and the surrounding low signal structures so hopefully I've convinced you now  
00:17:03.600 that changing the TR time will highlight the T1 differences in tissues and changing the te time  
00:17:09.300 will highlight the t2 differences in tissues and if we have a long TR time and a longer t  
00:17:15.119 e time we are going to get a T2 weighted image a shorter TR and a short te time is going to give  
00:17:21.839 us a T1 weighted image a combination of a long TR and a shorty will give us what's known as  
00:17:27.720 a proton density weighted image now in terms of remembering the TR and t e values I haven't seen  
00:17:33.900 exams where you are required to remember specific values what you want is ballpark figures you'll  
00:17:39.240 often be given values and ask to say what type of weighting this image is now when we think of long  
00:17:45.480 TR times we're thinking about 2 000 milliseconds we're in the late thousands to 2000 Range when  
00:17:52.980 we think about t e times we are dealing with the hundreds short e times are in the tens values 10  
00:17:59.700 to 30 and longer t e times are in the 80 to 160 range so if you're ever given a TR time  
00:18:06.960 that is within the hundreds 300 to 600 you know that that's a short TR because we're not in the  
00:18:13.620 late thousand to 2000 Range when you're given a te value that is closer to the hundreds range rather  
00:18:20.460 than the tens range we're dealing with a longer t e and as long as you can remember those kind  
00:18:25.380 of orders of magnitude or scale you'll be able to identify what kind of weighting you're going to be  
00:18:30.180 creating in your image purely based on the TR and te values and again if you're wanting to practice  
00:18:35.760 these types of questions by the time I finish this entire course there will be a question Bank in the  
00:18:41.460 Top Line in the description that's a great place to identify the various knowledge gaps that you  
00:18:45.540 have and see where you need to focus your studying on now we're going to draw a line at the end of  
00:18:50.460 T1 and T2 differences in tissue and we're going to shift our Focus to localizing where exactly signal  
00:18:56.160 is coming from within the image we'll see how we select a specific slice in our MRI and how we plot  
00:19:02.820 the signal values based on the X and Y plane within our image so join me in that next talk  
00:19:08.160 where we start to look at spatial localization in MRI images until then goodbye everybody
