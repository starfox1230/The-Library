00:00:00.680 hello everybody and welcome back we're going to  shift our attention now to dose in CT Imaging and
00:00:05.680 I want to separate this into three different  modules the first being today's talk we're
00:00:10.600 going to look at what exactly dose is and how  dose is imparted on tissues we're also going
00:00:15.840 to look at some of the basic units we use  to describe dose then we're going to look
00:00:20.720 at dose specifically in CT Imaging how we go  about estimating the amount of dose a patient
00:00:26.360 receives during a specific CT examination and  how we can use that dose estimate to try and
00:00:31.640 figure out the long-term stochastic risk for  that patient they have developing cancer for
00:00:36.400 that specific examination finally we're going to  end off by looking at the factors that influence
00:00:41.600 those what can we CH change as radiographers or  Radiologists to increase or reduce the amount
00:00:47.080 of dose that a patient receives during a CT scan  I feel like one of the common issues that people
00:00:53.080 have when they first start learning about dose  in CT Imaging is the sheer amount of different
00:00:57.960 terms or the sheer number of different terms  that describe dose in imaging now each one of
00:01:03.360 these terms represents something slightly subtly  different from the other and hopefully by the end
00:01:09.120 of these three modules we will have detangled this  mess we have gone through each one of these terms
00:01:14.640 and we'll know exactly what they represent and  most importantly what they mean for the patient
00:01:19.000 No text
00:01:19.400 now I think the best place to start is to Define  what exactly dose is now whenever you see a dose
00:01:25.040 estimate or a dose figure it's describing one of  two things either it's describing the amount of
00:01:30.640 energy that's deposited in the tissues of that  patient we measure that using units gray or it's
00:01:36.240 determining the stochastic risk to that patient  from the dose that they've received what's the
00:01:41.160 long-term likelihood that they're going to develop  something like cancer in the future based on the
00:01:45.200 ionizing radiation that they' received here Grays  talk about energy deposition SE vers talk about
00:01:51.920 risk estimation now that's the units that we  use to describe dose but how does a patient
00:01:57.520 actually receive dose well in CT Imaging we're  talking about X-rays and we know that x-rays
00:02:00.000 No text
00:02:02.000 can interact with matter in one of three ways they  can either be transmitted through the patient they
00:02:06.560 don't interact with the tissues at all they can be  attenuated by the tissues in the patient through
00:02:11.360 the photoelectric effect or they can be scattered  via Compton scatter or ra scatter and it's the
00:02:17.040 attenuation or scattering that causes energy to  be deposited in the tissues and ultimately leads
00:02:22.800 to ionization of atoms within the patient here  which is what dose is in the patient so let's look
00:02:28.280 at these two processes in more detail first we'll  start with attenuation or the photoelectric effect
00:02:33.520 we have our average atom here within the patient  and we have an incident x-ray Photon interacting
00:02:39.080 with this atom and it's going to eject an electron  from that atom it's ionizing this atom here we get
00:02:45.960 the ejection of a photo electron here and this  x-ray is causing ionization of this atom so one
00:02:52.840 x-ray is going to ionize one atom here and eject  a photo electron it's this photo electron that's
00:02:58.680 actually going to impart most most of the dose on  the patient this initial ionization is very small
00:03:03.960 part of the dose in scattered radiation again we  have an atom and we've got an incident x-ray that
00:03:10.360 is not fully absorbed by the electron that it  collides with the electron is released this a
00:03:16.320 compon electron or photo electron that's released  into the local tissues as well as this scattered
00:03:21.440 x-ray that deflects at a certain scatter angle  here this x-ray can then go on to ionize further
00:03:28.040 atoms as well but this ionization based on the  electromagnetic radiation importantly is a very
00:03:33.400 small part of the dose this electron is going  to impart dose so let's follow this electron
00:03:38.480 and see what it does as it passes through local  tissues nearby to where that interaction occurred
00:03:44.600 if we think of the tissue surrounding is having  multiple different electrons this is very much a
00:03:45.000 No text
00:03:49.040 diagrammatic representation all these electrons  are part of different atoms part of different
00:03:53.160 structures here the initial ionization event from  the electromagnetic radiation or the X-ray Photon
00:03:59.480 occur here that photo electron is then going to  travel through tissues it's going to move in a
00:04:05.800 nonlinear line because it's going to be repelled  by other electrons negative charges repel each
00:04:11.920 other not only that it's going to slow down as  you would have seen from that animation as it
00:04:17.000 comes to rest here starts off with high kinetic  energy gets lower and lower kinetic energy as it
00:04:22.360 comes to rest as it travels along this path here  whilst it's traveling through the tissues this
00:04:27.560 is the most important part it's going to repel  surrounding electrons along that path it's that
00:04:33.760 electrostatic force of repulsion that's going  to ionize different atoms along this path here
00:04:39.920 that's the major energy deposition that's going  to happen in tissues that's the major dose that's
00:04:45.680 imparted on this patient it's not that initial  x-ray the electron moving through these tissues
00:04:52.200 and imparting energy into the tissues or ionizing  surrounding atoms is what's known as linear energy
00:04:58.760 transfer we are transferring energy that kinetic  energy from that electron as it slows down it's
00:05:05.680 transferring energy out into the tissues now  I don't know if you've seen these ramps here
00:05:11.240 before we have many of them here in South Africa  where there's a long downhill say coming down off
00:05:15.480 a mountain path and if a truck was to lose its  brakes instead of continuing along the road it
00:05:20.400 would divert its path and would go into this uh  pit here that's filled with sand and rocks linear
00:05:27.400 energy transfer is very much dependent on the type  of vehicle that's traveling through the tissues in
00:05:32.920 CT examinations we're dealing with electrons  that are traveling through the tissues light
00:05:37.800 very small charged particles when we go into our  nuclear medicine block we're going to look at much
00:05:42.640 heavier much more highly charged particles like  alpha particles we can think of an alpha particle
00:05:47.800 as being a large heavy truck that's traveling into  the sandpit the rocks and the sand in this sandpit
00:05:54.000 here are not going to divert the truck very much  the truck's going to take a pretty straight path
00:05:58.320 it's going to displace a lot lot of sand impart  a lot of dose into the sand here and it's going
00:06:03.960 to travel a very short distance before coming to  a halt as it buries into the sand there if you
00:06:08.640 think of an electron traveling at the same speed  but an electron is someone on the bicycle as they
00:06:13.440 hit the sandpit they can be bounced around a lot  each rock is going to cause that bicycle to change
00:06:18.240 path it's not going to displace much sand and it's  going to travel a much further distance through
00:06:22.840 these tissues that's similar to what linear  energy transfer is describing and it's very much
00:06:28.080 dependent on the type of particle that travels  through the tissue and it's important to remember
00:06:32.480 that it's electrons photo electrons that have  been ejected from atoms that are imparting dose
00:06:37.280 into those tissues in CT Imaging so that's all  good and well but where is that electromagnetic
00:06:42.000 No text
00:06:43.160 that ionizing radiation coming from now when we're  talking about dose that source of ioniz radiation
00:06:50.160 is what's known as the emission Source now either  the source can be from a radioactive substance
00:06:55.440 that we're going to look at when we go into our  nuclear medicine learning pathway where we have
00:06:59.160 an unstable Atomic nucleus that's going to Decay  and release ionizing radiation that's not the case
00:07:05.600 in CT Imaging we know that x-rays are released  from the anode in our x-ray tube that's rotating
00:07:12.240 around the patient and emission of those x-rays  occurs at the focal spot where we're generating
00:07:18.160 x-rays through characteristic and bamrung  interactions here and those x-rays are going
00:07:23.120 to be released at multiple different energies  based on the energy of the electrons being
00:07:30.360 accelerated towards the anode and based on the  material that the anode is made out of and the
00:07:35.080 number of electrons is going to differ depending  on the current that we're passing through the
00:07:39.040 filament as well as the tube potential here and  the number and average energy of those x-rays is
00:07:44.840 what's known as the photon fluence now emission  of x-rays doesn't mean that they are going to
00:07:51.560 impart dose they have to interact with tissues for  dose to occur if you have a radioactive substance
00:07:57.640 that's in the middle of the ocean and no one's  near that substance we're not being exposed to
00:08:02.280 that radioactivity there's a difference between  the mission actually releasing ionizing radiation
00:08:08.040 and exposure when we talk about exposure we talk  about the interaction between emitted ionizing
00:08:09.000 No text
00:08:14.160 radiation and some form of tissue here we've  got a tube that's filled with air x-rays are
00:08:21.160 heading towards that tube going to interact  with atoms within the air there some of them
00:08:26.240 are going to be transmitted without interacting  through this chn Amber and some of them are going
00:08:31.120 to interact with atoms and release electrons  this interaction here this release of electrons
00:08:37.799 is what's known as exposure it's the interaction  between ionizing radiation and matter now how do
00:08:43.600 we go about measuring exposure this is ultimately  what we want to eventually measure in our patient
00:08:45.000 No text
00:08:48.560 that's getting a CT examination what we can do  is place electrodes on either side of this gas
00:08:53.760 chamber that's filled with air you can run a  wire between the two and put a volmeter here
00:08:58.400 if we were to make make a charge differential  between these electrodes what's going to happen
00:09:02.680 is those electrons that have been released are  going to flow through the tube and ultimately
00:09:08.520 change our volmeter here look what happens to the  volmeter here as we pass a charge through here the
00:09:14.800 volts that pass through this wire are going to  be proportional to the number of electrons that
00:09:19.280 have been released by this ionizing radiation and  we can measure exposure here by calculating the
00:09:25.480 amount of charge that's been released over the  mass of tissue or the mass of the chamber that
00:09:30.120 we have here that charge we're going to measure in  kums the mass we're going to measure in kilograms
00:09:35.280 this is kums per kilogram the other unit you may  have heard of this is called a runin now remember
00:09:40.720 when we're talking about dose we're either  talking about energy deposited into tissues or
00:09:44.880 we're talking about risk to the patient now air  has no risk here we're not calculating any risk
00:09:49.880 here the air is not at risk of getting cancer what  we almost calculating here is energy deposited
00:09:55.360 into tissues but we haven't actually got energy  here we've got charge deposited into tissues we
00:10:00.640 can convert this exposure value into an energy  per kilogram value using something that's known
00:10:06.000 No text
00:10:06.400 as Kera kinetic energy released per unit mass  and because we're dealing with air here we can
00:10:12.120 calculate air Kera we can take the exposure that  we've just calculated here with our electrodes
00:10:17.480 and we can multiply that by the average energy it  takes to release an electron from an atom in air
00:10:23.560 divided by the charge of an electron this charge  of an electron is going to cancel out the [ __ ]
00:10:28.680 here and we going to get jewles per kilogram as  our unit air coma is measured in Jew per kilogram
00:10:35.680 and that Jew per kilogram is what's known as  a gray here now we can measure the at least
00:10:41.160 the initial energy that's been deposited by this  emitted x-ray is being exposed to this air here
00:10:49.080 now air Kaa is not the same as tissue Kaa we know  that the average energy to release an electron in
00:10:55.800 air is going to be different from that in tissues  what we want to calculate is the dose in tissues
00:11:01.640 not the dose in air and that dose in tissues is  what's known as the absorb dose also measured in
00:11:05.000 No text
00:11:07.080 Gray we normally measure it in milligray now the  problem is we can't put uh electrodes on either
00:11:14.760 side of our patient and have the patient sitting  there with tissue and measure the charge running
00:11:18.720 through the patient that's completely impractical  we still measure this absorb dose of dose in
00:11:24.240 tissue by Jews per kilogram but we don't actually  have a good way in a CT examination to say this
00:11:29.640 is the exact absorb dose that this patient is  getting what we end up having to do is estimate
00:11:34.640 dose and you'll see that trying to calculate or  at least estimate absorb dose is fraught it's very
00:11:41.000 difficult to get an accurate measurement of this  and this is one of the major issues when it comes
00:11:44.440 to dealing with dose in CT Imaging firstly if we  were to place this patient in a CT machine we know
00:11:50.360 that dose as x-rays pass through this patient is  unevenly distributed x-rays get attenuated as they
00:11:56.840 pass through the patient now we're looking at this  side on if we look at the patient endon we can see
00:12:01.920 the x-rays passing through the different regions  of the patient and they pass through different
00:12:06.200 lengths they attenuation their linear attenuation  is going to occur differently depending on how
00:12:11.440 much tissue they pass through now that dose is  unevenly distributed not only that but the CT
00:12:17.720 machine is going to rotate around the patient  and you'll see how dose then is distributed
00:12:23.520 in a typical single slice in a CT examination we  get a lot of dose on the peripheries the patient
00:12:29.720 with less dose in the middle so you can see that  this is our first major challenge when it comes to
00:12:34.840 estimating dose within a patient we get an unequal  distribution of dose here not only that but the
00:12:42.160 size of the patient is very important let's take  that same CT examination but we're going to reduce
00:12:48.000 No text
00:12:48.520 the size of the patient the same current going  through the filament the same tube potential all
00:12:54.160 the parameters are the same but now we can see  that this smaller patient is going to receive
00:12:59.480 a much higher absorbed dose per kilogram of  tissue We compare these two patients here these
00:13:05.720 two patients within the same CT machine but  look how much more dose this smaller patient
00:13:09.800 say a pediatric patient is going to get so it's  difficult to plug in certain parameters on a CT
00:13:15.840 machine not take into account our patient that's  sitting in there and try and figure out what dose
00:13:20.560 they're going to be we can't standardize absorb  dose we need to take the patient into account
00:13:25.200 so you can see it's difficult we can't directly  measure absorb dose we can't measured for multiple
00:13:28.000 No text
00:13:30.000 different regions I've mentioned some of them we  see that energy deposition differs depending on
00:13:34.440 the tissue type the same exposure of a certain  xray fluence to say bone and lung is going to
00:13:39.760 result in very different energy depositions  most of the x-rays pass through lung they're
00:13:43.760 transmitted through lung most of the x-rays are  absorbed by bone so the same x-ray fluence is
00:13:49.960 going to cause much more energy deposition in  bone than it does in lung our absorb dose is
00:13:54.560 going to be different between those two tissues we  know that energy energy deposition is not uniform
00:13:59.320 especially once we start to account for  the different types of tissues we've seen
00:14:03.160 that the patient size and their shape drastically  influences the dose that they receive and we know
00:14:08.080 that dose is dependent on the energy Spectrum  the X-ray fluence that's heading towards the
00:14:12.720 patient and as x-rays pass through a patient the  lower energy x-rays are preferentially attenuated
00:14:18.960 by the photoelectric effect and we get a harder  beam or higher average energy of that x-ray beam
00:14:24.360 as it passes through patients so that then becomes  difficult to assess what type of dose is happening
00:14:29.120 through the patient we know that the rotation of  the X-ray Source around the patients mean that if
00:14:34.480 we were looking at a specific spot on the patient  we say what dose is that specific tissue getting
00:14:39.680 well it depends where the X-ray source is at that  given point in time and lastly direct measurements
00:14:46.440 of absorb dose is just completely impractical  we can't place the symmers within the tissues
00:14:51.760 of the patient and measure directly the ionization  that's occurring that just can't happen when we're
00:14:57.560 measuring absorb dose we measuring energy  deposition and not risk if we want to try
00:15:03.320 and tell a patient how much risk they have from a  specific examination we need to account for more
00:15:09.000 factors than absorb dose can allow us to we need  to look at the type of radiation as well as the
00:15:15.520 tissue sensitivity these two factors are going  to determine the risk to the patient much more
00:15:21.880 than the absorb dose alone and I'm going to show  you how we can take the absorb dose and account
00:15:26.200 for these factors to get a risk estimate later  on so let's take the absorb dose and account
00:15:32.000 for the type of radiation this is what's known  as the equivalent dose we call the equivalent
00:15:33.000 No text
00:15:36.840 dose H H to the subscrip T tissue here we take  the absorb dose and we apply what's known as a
00:15:43.480 waiting Factor radiation waiting Factor now when  we looked at linear energy transfer we said that
00:15:48.560 x-rays have a much lower linear energy transfer  than say something like an alpha particle which
00:15:54.040 is a heavier more highly charged particle now the  waiting factor for x and gamma rays is actually
00:16:00.160 one so when we convert our absorb dose to an  equivalent dose the numerical value is going
00:16:06.440 to stay the same the only thing that's going to  change is our units here our waiting factor is m
00:16:11.880 c ver per Mig gray so this gray is going to cancel  out with our absorb dose grade we're going to
00:16:17.440 leave ourselves with an equivalent dose that's  measured in Motes now what we're saying here
00:16:23.120 is that for the same absorb dose between X-rays  and alpha particles the same jewles per kilogram
00:16:29.240 deposited into the tissues that patient is 20  times more likely to get long-term say cancer
00:16:35.320 or stochastic effects from AN alha particle then  they are for the same absorb dose of x-rays here
00:16:41.400 so the equivalent dose accounts for the type  of radiation it's often forgotten about an
00:16:46.440 x-ray radiation because this waiting factor is  one but importantly those units change because
00:16:51.680 we're now talking about risk again this has said  nothing about the patient yet so our equivalent
00:16:56.920 dose hasn't taken the patient into it account it's  taken into account the parameters that we've used
00:17:01.600 say in our CT machine and the type of radiation  that we're using to calculate some form of risk
00:17:07.119 what we want to do now is try and calculate  what risk comes from the specific tissue type
00:17:10.000 No text
00:17:12.920 different tissues have different propensities to  develop long-term effects such as cancer and what
00:17:19.240 the international Commission of the radiological  protection have done has created tissue waiting
00:17:24.480 factors waiting factors that say how much each  of these tissues contribute to the total cancer
00:17:31.120 coming from radiation and these figures one  you'll see that they're all quite similar to
00:17:36.040 one another and two they've changed many times  over the years so that should ring alarm Bells
00:17:41.240 here that these are just estimates they're more  ballpark figures trying to get us in the right
00:17:46.600 regions of the tissue waiting factors they're  not very very specific but they show you the
00:17:52.280 differences between the tissues tissues that have  a higher cell turnover are more likely to develop
00:17:58.280 cancers long long term slow growing or tissues  that don't replace very often like brain tissue
00:18:03.920 have much lower weighting factors and what they've  done is they've looked at say the atomic bomb
00:18:09.400 survivors who were exposed to whole body radiation  and they've looked at which tissues go on then to
00:18:14.280 develop cancer they've looked at Patients who've  had long-term radiotherapy medical radiation and
00:18:19.920 seen the propensity for each of these tissues to  develop cancer and they've created a whole body
00:18:25.400 risk for these tissues so all of these are going  to add up to one in total and what we do is for a
00:18:31.440 specific examination say an abdominal CT we take  each and every organ that's exposed to radiation
00:18:38.280 in that abdominal CT so say we take the stomach  we calculate the absorb dose again we've got an
00:18:43.840 issue there because it's quite hard to calculate  absorb dose so we need a way of estimating that
00:18:48.240 and we multiply it by the tissue waiting Factor  we do that for all of the organs in that specific
00:18:53.520 examination and we add up each one of those values  to give ourselves an effective dose that means for
00:19:00.120 a specific CT examination we're going to get  a total effective dose now the effective dose
00:19:06.080 attempts to determine what dose exposure to the  whole body would give the same stochastic risk
00:19:10.920 as this specific examination that we've taken here  now this is all good and well in theory but again
00:19:15.320 we have no way of accurately measuring absorbed or  equivalent dose in CT Imaging so what we need to
00:19:20.600 do is have ways of estimating dose in CT Imaging  and that's what we're going to look at next how
00:19:26.000 can we take a specific CT examination and estimate  the dose that that patient received and how can
00:19:31.360 we account for the different shapes of patient  that we have the different parameters that we use
00:19:35.240 in our CT machine the different lengths of scans  that we're going to use all of those we're going
00:19:40.560 to look at in our next talk where we look at ctdi  DLP and ultimately calculating an effective dose
00:19:46.120 for a specific CT examination so I'll see you  all in that talk until then goodbye everybody
