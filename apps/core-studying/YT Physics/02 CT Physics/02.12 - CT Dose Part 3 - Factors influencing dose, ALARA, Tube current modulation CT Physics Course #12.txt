00:00:00.040 hello everybody and welcome back let's finish off this dose and CT module by looking at the factors  
00:00:04.840 that influence patient dose I said in the first two talks that it's actually quite difficult to  
00:00:09.720 calculate the specific absorb dose that a patient receives during a CT examination and as a result  
00:00:15.360 it's almost impossible to confidently give a risk estimate to that patient for the ionizing  
00:00:21.040 radiation exposure that they Reed during the CT exam now instead what we can do is abide  
00:00:25.880 by what's known as theara principle and I'm sure you've heard of this before now this is an incred  
00:00:30.280 important topic when it comes to CT physics because it has actual outcomes for the patient  
00:00:35.000 and as a result this question comes up almost in every single CT Physics exam and when I'm  
00:00:39.720 asked in an exam about the factors that influence patient dose I think about dose in three separate  
00:00:44.840 domains the factors that we can change prior to the patient receiving the scan whilst the patient  
00:00:50.120 is still in their bed in the hospital then I think about the scanning parameters that we can change  
00:00:55.800 and this obviously involves the most physics and as a result we're going to spend most of our  
00:01:00.160 times today looking at the scanning parameters but I also think about the post scan factors  
00:01:05.560 what can we change after the patient has had their exam that will influence future patients  
00:01:10.280 dose obviously once the patients received an exam they've received that dose we can't go  
00:01:14.200 and take away dose from that patient so let's start by focusing on the physics components  
00:01:19.480 here the scanning parameters that influence patient dose and there are five different  
00:01:23.760 parameters that I want to cover today the five main parameters that influence those the first  
00:01:28.920 being what's known as the kvp or the kilovolt peak we know that when we place a patient within the  
00:01:34.760 CT scanner we produce x-rays in the X-ray tube and those x-rays head out towards the patient  
00:01:41.000 and dose is distributed through that patient we looked at that in the last talk specifically we  
00:01:46.440 produce x-rays by accelerating electrons from the tungsten filament in the cathode towards  
00:01:52.360 the anode here the number of electrons and the energy that they are accelerated between the  
00:01:58.240 cathode and the anode is deter determined by the kvp those electrons strike the anode and create  
00:02:03.960 x-rays in a spectrum those x-rays are consisting of bmst strung and characteristic X-rays and that  
00:02:10.440 spectrum of x-rays contains a different number of X-ray photons at all the different energy levels  
00:02:16.720 we've seen this diagram before where we have the electrons being accelerated towards the anode  
00:02:22.280 this is a single tungsten atom within the anode and those electrons are going to create x-rays  
00:02:28.440 here these x-ray photons again create a spectrum and you've seen that this block here this purple  
00:02:34.480 block is a filter here's the filter here that preferentially filters out the lower energy x-rays  
00:02:41.440 so we get our x-ray Spectrum heading towards the patient what happens then if we were to increase  
00:02:46.680 the kvp increasing the kvp is going to increase the number of electrons and the average energy  
00:02:52.840 of those electrons and as a result it's going to influence the X-ray Spectrum now importantly dose  
00:02:58.480 is related to kvp P dose is roughly proportional to kvp to the power of n now why have I said to  
00:03:05.280 the power of n and not given you a number here well in traditional in radiography we often  
00:03:10.480 say that dose is roughly proportional to kvp to the^ of two in CT scanners n is normally closer  
00:03:17.600 to about 2.5 2.6 depending on the filtration that we use depending on the type of CT scanner that  
00:03:23.360 we use but you can see that minor changes in kvp are going to have quite drastic changes in the do  
00:03:29.960 to the patient predominantly due to the number of X-ray photons that are heading towards the patient  
00:03:35.600 Watch What Happens here when I change the kvp from 80 Kev to 100 Kev see how the X-ray Spectrum has  
00:03:43.840 shifted here the area under the curve has changed let me go back and watch how the graph changes  
00:03:49.720 from 100 to 80 our graph gets much smaller our highest Photon energy our maximum Photon energy  
00:03:56.680 gets smaller the area under the curve gets smaller as a result the dose gets lower as we increase kvp  
00:04:03.120 we increase the dose to the patient at roughly proportional to kvp to the power of 2.5 or 2.6 so  
00:04:10.200 kvp has a huge role to play when it comes to dose you may remember the 15% rule when we looked at  
00:04:16.120 radiography where we said that increasing the kvp by just 15% would require a Haring of the milliamp  
00:04:23.080 of the filament current in order to keep the dose the same a small 15% increase required a Haring  
00:04:29.920 of the uh filament current here it just shows you how much of a role kvp has to play in dose  
00:04:36.760 next we're going to look at filtration we've seen that the filter preferentially removes the lower  
00:04:42.080 energy x-ray photons and this is good because it not only increases the average energy of the  
00:04:47.800 photons that reach the patient increasing the quality of the X-ray beam but it also removes  
00:04:53.960 this dose that the patient would have received from these lower energy x-ray photons that would  
00:04:58.400 never have contributed to the image itself cuz none of these photons would have made it through  
00:05:02.720 the patient these low energy x-ray photons would have been attenuated by the patient and  
00:05:08.040 never reach the detector providing us no valuable information when we remove the filter here we can  
00:05:14.360 see that we are going to now expose the patient to much more x-ray photons the area under the graph  
00:05:19.640 here or the area under the curve is much larger and remember we had different types of filters  
00:05:24.760 in CT scanners the bow tie filter that compensate for the changes in patient shape we know that as  
00:05:30.480 we head out to the peripheries generally of body parts there's less tissue for the X-ray photons  
00:05:35.280 to travel through and that shaping filter is going to allow for those changes in attenuation  
00:05:41.120 but providing filtration is going to increase the X-ray beam quality as well as reduce patient dose  
00:05:47.720 next we're going to look at pitch and we looked at pitch in the previous talk we said Pitch is  
00:05:51.880 related to the rate at which the patient moves through the CT scanner the table speed as well  
00:05:57.640 as how fast the X-ray source is rotating around the patient as well as the beam width if we were  
00:06:03.760 to keep the table speed the same and the rotation time the same but just increase the beam width  
00:06:09.120 increase the coverage in The Zed axis for one beam increasing our cone angle here reducing colation  
00:06:15.760 say we would be exposing more of the patient to ionizing radiation per rotation so we're going  
00:06:22.080 to be reducing the pitch and a reduction in Pitch we know is an increase in dose the same with table  
00:06:28.040 speed the slower we move move the patient through the scanner the more they're going to be exposed  
00:06:32.880 to ionizing radiation for a specific coverage the lower the pitch is going to be so we can  
00:06:38.160 see that lowering the pitch is going to increase the dose dose is inversely proportional to pitch  
00:06:45.800 the speed at which the patient moves through the CT scanner the table speed is going to determine  
00:06:51.960 how that dose is distributed in The Zed axis so it's important to remember this dose pitch  
00:06:57.000 relationship but it's also important to remember how changing each one of these parameters is going  
00:07:01.640 to influence pitch and ultimately influence dose a classic exam question again the next  
00:07:07.000 factor that we're going to look at is current modulation milliampere modulation we know that  
00:07:12.360 if we modulate the current that's passing through the tungsten filament within the cathode we're  
00:07:17.760 going to change the number of electrons that are available at the surface of the filament  
00:07:21.800 through the process of thermionic emission and ultimately change the number of electrons that  
00:07:25.760 are going to be accelerated towards the anode that in turn is going to determine the number  
00:07:30.440 of X-ray photons heading out towards our patient now if we were to plot a graph here of current on  
00:07:36.200 the Y AIS and time on the x-axis whilst the CT machine rotates around our patient and we had  
00:07:43.680 a little sensor here by the detectors that sensed how many x-ray photons are being received by these  
00:07:50.720 detectors if the patient had a constant diameter throughout the number of X-ray photons reaching  
00:07:57.760 that Center would remain constant and if we were to link this sensor with our x-ray tube here and  
00:08:04.600 we were to say if the X-ray photon number changes here will'll change our current we could plot the  
00:08:11.000 graph that would be made for this specific exam a patient of constant diameter requires  
00:08:16.960 a constant current at the cathode because the X-ray photons are being attenuated evenly no  
00:08:23.240 matter what angle they incident on the patient now we know that patients aren't perfect circles  
00:08:29.720 generally most parts of the body have an oval shape like this x-rays passing through this  
00:08:35.039 angle of the patient are passing through a shorter distance and therefore we require fewer x-rays to  
00:08:40.720 get the same exposure on the detectors compared to x-rays passing lengthways through this oval we're  
00:08:46.680 going to need more x-rays passing through here to get the same exposure as a result we're going to  
00:08:51.720 have to increase the filament current now watch with this shape how the filament current needs  
00:08:57.680 to change in order to keep equal exposure on the X-ray detectors you can see that as  
00:09:03.720 we pass through thicker parts of the patient we require more current thinner parts of the  
00:09:08.960 patient require less current this is what's known as angular current modulation current modulation  
00:09:15.680 based on the shape of the patient in the XY plane that's important now if we place our patient in  
00:09:22.600 the scanner here and we're rotating around them and we've got an oval patient here we're going  
00:09:26.160 to need angular modulation like this but we know that firstly our patient isn't always the same  
00:09:34.160 width their oval that they have is not the same width depending on where we are in the body if we  
00:09:38.920 take our Scout image here or our scanogram here the head is much narrower than say the thorax  
00:09:44.840 here in this patient their hips are even wider than the thorax so we're going to need to change  
00:09:49.960 that angular modulation depending on where we are in the body so for instance in this case as the  
00:09:56.760 CT machine rotates around this patient the tube current is going to have to change or the filament  
00:10:02.520 current is going to have to change depending on the width of the different body parts here and you  
00:10:06.920 can see those changes here again this is what's known as angular Uh current modulation angular  
00:10:14.920 current modulation if you think about a helical scanner here that's rotating as the patient's  
00:10:20.240 moving through the CT scanner it's being exposed to different body parts that's going to change  
00:10:24.880 based on the dimensions of the patient not only are the dimensions of the patient changing though  
00:10:31.400 but the densities of the different structures based on location also changes notice how the  
00:10:37.440 thorax is much less dense in general than say the pelvis here we're going to require a higher  
00:10:43.240 current here to get the same exposure going through the pelvis as we would going through  
00:10:47.120 the thorax and what we can do is either place a same sensor here that detects the number of  
00:10:53.960 X-ray photons traveling through the patient and is being received at the detectors and ultimately  
00:10:59.320 feed back to our filament and increase or decrease the filament based on the amount of x-rays or the  
00:11:04.360 number of x-rays passing through the patient or we could take a scanogram like this and analyze the  
00:11:10.560 density of the structures in this Scout Radio graph and say well let's take every column of  
00:11:16.040 pixels here and add up their pixel values and that would correspond to the density of the various  
00:11:22.800 different structures based on their location in the patient and that's exactly what I've done  
00:11:26.240 with this graph here that I've made I've taken each of the pixel values and sum them for each  
00:11:32.560 of the columns in this scanogram and I've plotted that on a graph notice how the petris bone has a  
00:11:39.520 little bit more attenuation than say the skull here the neck has very little attenuation the  
00:11:45.280 shoulder girdle because we've got bones we've got the clavicle the scapula the head of the humorus  
00:11:49.840 here it's going to be a bit more dense lung tissue less dense breast tissue is contributing to some  
00:11:55.760 density here we get a drop off below the breast tissue before we then get into the solid organs  
00:12:01.280 of the liver here and we see the pelvis has even more attenuation in this patient this is what's  
00:12:08.200 known as modulation in The Zed AIS so we need to modulate tube current or filament current based on  
00:12:14.360 the dimensions of the patient here as well as the density of the different structures in the patient  
00:12:19.440 here this is analogous to automatic exposure control that you may have seen in radiography here  
00:12:25.360 this is what's known as tube modulation or current modulation and we can combine these two factors  
00:12:31.240 to get our overall current modulation that we're going to need for this specific patient notice how  
00:12:36.880 we still get that oscillating sine wave here based on the dimensions of the patient but our Baseline  
00:12:44.160 current is going to change based on the density in The Zed axis here this is perhaps the most  
00:12:49.600 difficult physics concept to understand in the factors that influence those and I'd encourage you  
00:12:53.600 to spend some time figuring out in your mind the difference between the angular modulation and the  
00:12:59.240 Zed axis modulation now another factor that may come up when we're talking about dose reduction  
00:13:05.040 and CT scanning is what's known as shielding there are certain areas in the body that we know  
00:13:09.440 are more radiosensitive that goads because those genetic mutations can be passed on Generations  
00:13:14.800 or say breast tissue is more sensitive to dose and we can place Shields over those tissues when  
00:13:20.680 the patient is going into this heating machine and place a bismuth Shield say over the breast tissue  
00:13:26.200 and that in theory if we were taking an abdominal scan would prevent some x-rays from being incident  
00:13:31.720 on the breast tissue if we were to creep up into the chest cavity for that CT scan so that reduces  
00:13:39.200 dose from incident x-rays it doesn't reduce dose from scattered x-rays within the patient  
00:13:44.080 those scattered x-rays are going to go underneath that Shield that we placed across the patient the  
00:13:48.640 reason I'm mentioning it here is often you can make the mistake of placing the shield on the  
00:13:53.800 patient when you take the Scout image that Shield is very dense it doesn't allow x-ray photons to  
00:13:58.640 pass through it then when we run this uh current modulation we're going to include that x-ray  
00:14:05.320 shield in our calculations for this Z axis tube modulation that's going to ramp up the filament  
00:14:13.720 current way higher to try and penetrate that shield and inadvertently is going to expose our  
00:14:18.080 patient to more dose so placing the shield can if we're not careful end up being more harmful to the  
00:14:25.360 patient that it is good we must remove the shield when taking the Scout image if the Scout image is  
00:14:31.200 what's being used to modulate the filament current that's an important point to remember obviously  
00:14:37.080 shielding is incredibly important when it comes to staff members uh who are taking the C scan or  
00:14:41.840 taking x-rays that's something we're going to talk about when we talk about radiation safety later on  
00:14:46.760 now the last concept I want to cover when it comes to scanning parameters is a very simple one it's  
00:14:50.880 coverage obviously the scan length that we expose the patient to is going to be proportional to the  
00:14:58.120 dose that that patient receives the more scan length the more coverage we have of the anatomy  
00:15:04.840 in the patient the more dose total dose that patient's going to receive this is something  
00:15:09.320 that can easily happen in clinical practice say we want to get a scan of the patient's liver and you  
00:15:14.760 think I'm just going to include a little bit more in that scan I'm just going to include a little  
00:15:17.760 bit more and eventually when you want to look at say just the abdomen you start looking at pelvic  
00:15:22.320 structures you start looking at the lower thorax here just to make sure that we include everything  
00:15:27.360 we're not doing the patient any service because we are now exposing them to more radiation than  
00:15:32.040 their specific examination requires so this is an important factor to remember when planning LCT  
00:15:38.120 scan so those are the scanning parameters I said there were some pre-scan factors and post scan  
00:15:43.080 factors these don't really have physics principles but they're important to remember when thinking  
00:15:47.480 about theara principle when thinking about reducing total total patient dose firstly before  
00:15:53.560 the patient receives a scan we need to say is the scan Justified will performing this scan change  
00:15:59.080 an outcome for the patient will it change the management for that patient does this patient  
00:16:03.520 actually need this specific scan that's important to remember we very quick to say every patient  
00:16:08.800 coming into the Ed just needs a CT scan next is there an alternative investigation is this an  
00:16:15.360 atrisk patient is this a young patient are there alternative investigations that don't use ionizing  
00:16:20.880 radiation that we have at our hospital and are feasible for us next we need to think about the  
00:16:25.560 type of scan that we're going to do are we going to have a three-phase scan scaned are we going to  
00:16:29.680 have a pre contrast a contrast and a postcontrast scan or can we get away with say an uncontr scan  
00:16:36.080 obviously increasing the number of phases repeats the number of times we're doing the CT scan itself  
00:16:41.360 and every repetition is just adding dose to that patient and lastly and perhaps most importantly  
00:16:46.360 is to check for prior this is something that uh we as Radiologists perhaps are most guilty of  
00:16:51.680 or ordering clinicians are most guilty of is you have a patient coming in for the same problem week  
00:16:57.320 on week on week and they're getting a seat scan every single week that's coming back is negative  
00:17:01.640 and we're expecting a different result to come up if this patient has multiple negative CT scans  
00:17:06.400 perhaps they don't need the CT scan say a pregnant patient that's come in with shortness of breath  
00:17:10.720 and we've checked for a PE multiple times do they really need another CT scan or do we need to start  
00:17:15.359 looking for another cause for that shortness of breath and then I think about post scan factors  
00:17:21.359 these things don't influence the patient that's had the CT scan right now's dose obviously if  
00:17:26.160 you've had the CT scan we can't go and take away dose you've received the dose that you've received  
00:17:30.760 but it's going to affect future patients that are receiving CT scans in our unit the first thing we  
00:17:35.600 can look at is the hardware that we have within our units are we using the appropriate filtration  
00:17:41.920 is this an old CT scanner is this time for us to upgrade to newer better equipment that perhaps  
00:17:47.760 doesn't expose the patient to much as much radiation are there defects in the hardware  
00:17:53.280 are all our detectors working are we having to compensate for some faults in the hardware that  
00:17:58.080 means that we require higher tube currents to get the same image quality next we can think about the  
00:18:03.400 software we know that say for image reconstruction we saw that iterative reconstruction techniques  
00:18:09.040 can allow us to perform CT examinations at much lower doses but still get the same image quality  
00:18:15.600 so perhaps updating the software is going to reduce the amount of dose needed to create the  
00:18:20.280 same image quality and lastly this is something that's important especially for new Radiologists  
00:18:26.000 who are wanting to do research in their unit or w to make an impact on patients within their unit is  
00:18:31.280 to review the quality of the images perhaps have ordered protocols in place so of all of the images  
00:18:36.680 that we've taken so far are they of adequate quality are we able to reduce certain parameters  
00:18:42.440 and still get the outcomes that we need for the patient constantly reviewing are we applying  
00:18:47.760 the L principle to our patients are we giving them doses that are low as low as reasonably achievable  
00:18:53.920 while still maintaining diagnostic quality so that brings us to the end of this dose in CT  
00:18:59.160 module we've now looked at three separate talks and hopefully you understand what dose is and  
00:19:03.600 how it occurs how we go about calculating dose and estimating risk and the factors that we can change  
00:19:09.320 in order to reduce patient dose now we're going to shift gears entirely and look at a type of CT  
00:19:15.200 acquisition known as dual energy CT so I'll see you all in that talk until then goodbye everybody
