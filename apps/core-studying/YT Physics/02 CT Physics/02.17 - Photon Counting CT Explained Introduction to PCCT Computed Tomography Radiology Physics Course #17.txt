00:00:00.080 Hello everybody and welcome to this introduction to photon counting CT. The way I'm going to frame this talk is by
00:00:06.000 comparing photon counting CT detectors to conventional computer tomography detectors that we're using in most CT
00:00:12.320 scanners today. And I want to do this because I feel like photon counting CTS has the potential at least to be a
00:00:18.960 stepwise progression in computer tomography technology. There are fundamental differences between these
00:00:24.560 two types of detectors. So let's look at the diagrams that I've created for the two detectors. This is the conventional
00:00:31.039 detector we're going to look at and this is the photon counting detector. You can see they differ structurally and they're
00:00:36.640 going to differ in their mechanism for detecting X-rays. I want to start this talk by looking at an analogy to show
00:00:40.000 No text
00:00:43.040 you or to highlight the differences between the types of detectors. If we think of the detectors as being buckets
00:00:49.039 of water, they have some water in them. I've got the conventional detector on the left that's got a finite bucket that
00:00:55.440 doesn't leak water. All the water stays in the bucket. And the photon counting detector on the right that has maintains
00:01:01.280 a constant level of water. And every time new water is added, that water is going to leak out and the level is going
00:01:06.880 to remain the same. Now, what we're going to do is fill these buckets with X-rays. We're going to fill them with
00:01:13.040 raindrops in this analogy. And we're going to plot the changes in water within the buckets over time.
00:01:20.080 I want you to think of the conventional detectors as being like a scale. It's weighing the amount of water that is
00:01:26.320 going into the bucket and think of photon counting detectors as a water level measure. We've got a little gauge
00:01:33.040 on the side of this bucket and we're going to measure the changes in water here. So, let's look at the conventional
00:01:38.880 detector. Water or X-rays are going to reach the detector over a certain period
00:01:44.000 of time. A conventional detector is then going to say what was the weight change in the
00:01:49.680 bucket. We using it like a scale and say how much water was added to that bucket. And we can take the integral of the
00:01:56.079 graph that we've generated here. The area under this curve is going to equal the amount of water that has reached the
00:02:01.520 bucket. That's what conventional CTS do. They measure the total incident X-ray
00:02:07.360 energy over a set period of time. And we set that by setting the number of projections that we want to take when
00:02:13.520 we're rotating around the patient. There's a time interval when we're collecting data. It's not looking at
00:02:19.599 individual raindrops. It's looking at the total number total amount of raindrops that have reached the detector
00:02:25.760 or the bucket. In this example, photon counting detectors are different. When the water in this example reaches the
00:02:33.280 bucket, it's going to send out a ripple that is proportional to the size of the raindrop. The sides of the different
00:02:38.720 raindrops are in this analogy represent the different energies of the X-ray photons reaching the detectors. So watch
00:02:44.720 what happens here and see how it differs. As the raindrops reach the buckets, they send out a ripple and the
00:02:50.400 water level measure on the side here is going to measure the size of that ripple. Notice how different the graph
00:02:57.120 is here. We're able to count the number of water droplets that have hit the bucket and we're able to see the size of
00:03:04.239 the water droplet or the energy of the X-ray photon. Photon counting detectors have the ability not only to count the
00:03:11.200 number of photons that have reached the detector, but also to separate those photons into the energy of the X-ray
00:03:17.920 photon. You can see here that as we are calculating the area under each one of these curves, the area under the curve
00:03:25.519 represents the X-ray photon energy for an individual photon. And each blip on
00:03:30.560 this graph represents a separate X-ray. You can see how we've able to separate
00:03:36.000 the X-rays out here. Whereas in conventional detectors, we're just getting the total X-rays over a set
00:03:41.360 period of time. We can't say anything about the individual energies. And this is the key difference between the two
00:03:46.959 types of detectors. So let's look at conventional CT detectors and see how they differ from photon counting
00:03:49.000 No text
00:03:53.560 detectors. Now in conventional detectors, we use what's known as indirect detection. X-ray photons,
00:04:00.400 electromagnetic radiation is converted into light photons. The same type of electromagnetic radiation, but now
00:04:06.400 they've got longer wavelengths. Those light photons are then measured by what's known as a photo diode. And that
00:04:12.720 light energy is converted into an electrical current that's stored. So let's look at the components here.
00:04:17.000 No text
00:04:17.918 First, we've got what's known as the cintillator layer. We've got it's usually made of something like gatalinium oxyulfide or cesium iodide.
00:04:25.680 And what that does, what that's responsible for is converting x-rays into visible
00:04:30.919 light. Surrounding the cintilator layer is what's known as the reflective scepter. We've got these scepter between
00:04:33.000 No text
00:04:38.000 each one of the detectors that prevent the light that's generated from spreading out to adjacent detectors. It
00:04:44.080 keeps it on one single detector. And you'll see one X-ray photon makes hundreds, thousands of light photons.
00:04:51.680 And those light photons spread out in 360 degrees. And we want them to be maintained to a single detector that
00:04:58.240 detector that the X-ray was incident on. That light energy is then converted
00:05:03.520 into an electrical current by the photo diode layer. The photosensitive area is going to create or free electrons that
00:05:04.000 No text
00:05:10.880 are going to then run towards what's known as a capacitor and ultimately be discharged with the transistor here.
00:05:17.440 That electrical current for each individual detector is going to be sent
00:05:22.560 towards our computer for processing via a mechanism known as the application specific integrated circuit. And the
00:05:23.000 No text
00:05:30.000 type of ASIC that we use in conventional CT detectors is what's known as an integration ASIC. We take the integral
00:05:36.960 of the curve that we generated when the X-ray photons were incident on this detector. And that integral is the area
00:05:43.280 under the curve. The total amount of X-ray energy that has reached our detector for a sec period of time. So
00:05:48.960 let's look at this head-on. We can see the photo diode layer here. Only this blue region on the photo diode is
00:05:55.120 sensitive to light. the rest of the components here. If X-rays are incident on them or light photons more
00:05:56.000 No text
00:06:01.440 specifically are incident on them, they're not going to contribute to our final signal. That's what's known as the
00:06:06.639 fill factor. The difference between the area that we're actually sensitive to light versus the total area of the
00:06:12.919 detector. The higher the fill factor, the more efficient our detector is because we're able to register more of
00:06:18.800 those light photons. So this photo diode layer has a silicon uh photosensitive
00:06:23.000 No text
00:06:24.639 area that's going to receive light. It has the capacitor here which is going to store or accumulate the electrical
00:06:27.000 No text
00:06:31.120 energy or the electrons that have been freed in this silicone layer over time. We store and store and store until the
00:06:37.840 transistor switch here gets a little bit of current. We provide a small amount of current to this transistor switch and
00:06:39.000 No text
00:06:43.919 that empties the capacitor. The emptying of the capacitor is giving the total electric charge that we've
00:06:50.000 liberated from the light photons and that's going to send it towards the ASIC here. If we look underneath our detector
00:06:56.479 here, we can see that the the circuitry within the detector is linked to the
00:07:01.599 ASIC that's going to send those signals off to our computer. So, let's look at a practical example here where we're going
00:07:05.000 No text
00:07:07.199 to have incident X-rays hitting our detector. An X-ray comes in and it's converted into hundreds or thousands of
00:07:13.759 light photons. Those light photons hit the photosensitive area here and a
00:07:19.440 charge is generated. Light energy is converted into an electrical impulse. That charge is then stored in the
00:07:26.000 capacitor. That's the function of a capacitor to store electrical energy. The number of light photons is
00:07:32.880 proportional to the energy of the incident X-ray photon. And therefore the stored electrical current that we've
00:07:38.479 sent from the photosensitive area to a capacitor is also going to be proportional to the incident X-ray
00:07:45.319 energy. Now we set a time interval where we're going to measure all of the X-rays coming in. And during that time
00:07:51.759 interval, multiple X-rays are going to hit the detector and send out light photons because of that cintillator
00:07:58.400 layer. Those light photons are going to be converted into electrical energy and continually fill up our capacitor. Here
00:08:05.440 you can see during this representation here over time our capacitor is being
00:08:10.960 filled up with stored electrical energy. At a given point in time that stored
00:08:17.039 electrical energy is going to be released through the ASIC and sent towards our computer. Now remember we're
00:08:22.960 looking at just one detector here. This detector forms part of a multiple rows of detectors or an array of detectors.
00:08:30.000 Each one of these detectors is going to be uh receiving different X-ray energies
00:08:35.360 and we're going to ultimately store different levels of electrical impulses. When we read out an entire
00:08:42.799 row, you saw that the ASIC actually runs in between each one of these detectors. When we flip the transistor switch, we
00:08:48.959 can actually read out an entire row of detectors. We're going to get a graph representing the electrical stored
00:08:55.680 energy in the capacitors. And that differs depending on the detector location because of the differing
00:09:00.720 anatomy that the X-rays have traveled through. We can then convert the stored electrical energy into our syog. We have
00:09:08.880 filled a row of the syog based on the incident X-ray photon energy, the number
00:09:14.560 of light photons that were released and then ultimately the amount of electrical charge that that generated on the
00:09:20.640 silicon portion of the photo diode layer. That's how conventional computer tomography detectors work.
00:09:27.040 Now, computer tomography detectors, their main characteristics is that there's an indirect conversion. The
00:09:28.000 No text
00:09:32.560 scintillator layer produces light before we create an electrical impulse. That's going to differ from photon counting CT
00:09:38.800 detectors. And secondly, there's energy integration. We're adding up all of the
00:09:44.000 energy and then using that total amount to create our image. We're not looking at individual X-ray energies. Now, this
00:09:50.959 leads to a number of shortfalls that photon counting CT detectors are going to try and address. The first being that
00:09:52.000 No text
00:09:57.760 we've got no complex energy discrimination. We're not able to accurately say what was the energy of
00:10:03.440 the X-ray photons that were incident on our detector in that period of time. We've looked at dual energy CT where we
00:10:10.560 can see two separate X-ray energy levels, but we can't really go much further than that. photon counting
00:10:16.000 detectors. Because we can look at individual X-ray energies, we're going to have much better spectral discrimination and much better tissue
00:10:22.959 discrimination. Ultimately, the next problem we have is noise, especially at low doses. If you cast your mind back to
00:10:28.880 the analogy of the bucket filling with water, we're only measuring the total change in the weight of that bucket. We
00:10:35.279 aren't measuring individual droplets that were falling into the bucket. So if we say the bucket got a kilogram
00:10:40.560 heavier, how much of that signal was due to just electrical background noise? It's hard to differentiate that out
00:10:46.800 because we've just got a total value. We'll see in photon counting detectors, we've got a much better primary way to
00:10:53.279 reduce the noise in our image. And we've looked at noise reduction techniques that apply to conventional CT detectors,
00:10:58.880 but photon counting CT detectors are going to give us an added level for noise reduction and ultimately improve
00:11:04.640 our signal to noise ratio. Thirdly, we've got limited spatial resolution in conventional detectors. I mentioned the
00:11:11.360 fill factor. We've got a lot of dead space here. Our scepter as well are providing place for incident X-rays to
00:11:16.640 hit and provide no meaningful signal. The the detectors, as we'll see later,
00:11:22.000 are also larger than photon counting detectors. We can also have light spreading between adjacent detectors and
00:11:28.560 reducing our spatial resolution. And we looked at the factors that influence spatial resolution in the image quality
00:11:34.640 lecture. When we look at photon counting CT, you'll see how some of those factors are reduced. We have limited artifact
00:11:41.600 reduction. Again, we can't really tell what energy or photons are coming through. So, an artifact such as beam
00:11:48.000 hardening where the beam's average energy gets much higher. We aren't able to accurately detect that in
00:11:53.680 conventional CT detectors and we need to provide post-processing algorithms to say reduce the cupping artifact. We
00:12:00.399 can't address the problem directly at the source. And lastly, the conventional
00:12:05.519 CT detectors have limited dose efficiency predominantly because of these previous shortfalls. We've got a
00:12:11.600 certain amount of noise that we just have to deal with. We can't improve our signal to noise ratio past a specific
00:12:16.959 point. Much of the dose that passes through the patient is going to reach parts of the the detector that don't
00:12:22.560 even contribute to our final uh image. When X-rays are converted to light, we get a loss of energy in that conversion.
00:12:29.360 So, it's not a perfectly efficient process. Many factors here limit the dose efficiency of CT
00:12:35.800 detectors. So let's then have a look at photon counting CT detectors and compare and contrast that to conventional
00:12:38.000 No text
00:12:42.760 detectors. You'll see here photon counting detectors are sandwiched between a cathode layer and an anode
00:12:49.360 layer. And there's a large voltage potential that's applied across this detector here in the order of hundreds
00:12:55.440 of volts. So, we got a large voltage potential and sandwiched between these two electrodes is what's known as the
00:13:00.000 No text
00:13:01.839 semiconductor crystal layer. In our examples, we're going to use a crystal layer that's made of cadmium teleride,
00:13:08.399 cd. You'll see that used often. Here's the chemical structure. And cadmium
00:13:13.519 teleride is perfect for this example because it's got good X-ray stopping power. It's got a high atomic number.
00:13:18.880 It's got lots of veence electrons, which you're going to see it becomes important during the generation of signal here.
00:13:25.120 It's stable at room temperature. It provides the perfect material for this photon counting CT
00:13:30.760 detector. Of note, though, is that these crystal layers rely on them being perfect. If there's any defect in these
00:13:37.839 layers, we're going to get a drastic offset in the accuracy of our signal. Photon counting detectors also
00:13:44.079 have an ASIC. You can see it running under here and it heads out. Now these AS6 are different to the integrated ASIC
00:13:45.000 No text
00:13:50.639 that we looked at in conventional computed tomography detectors because those detectors only receive the total
00:13:56.399 amount of energy from a transistor that was releasing stored energy from a capacitor. Here there's no capacitor, no
00:14:02.399 transistor. These asex are measuring an electrical impulse that's created when an incident photon interacts with the
00:14:08.639 semiconductor crystal layer. The predominant difference here between conventional CT and photon counting CT
00:14:15.279 detectors is that this is a direct conversion detector. X-ray energy is converted directly into an electrical
00:14:22.320 impulse. There's no light step in the middle. There's no scintillator layer here. So let's have a look at how that
00:14:28.240 process works. We're going to show you how we actually go about measuring signal in photon counting detectors. We
00:14:29.000 No text
00:14:34.079 have an incident X-ray that is going to interact with the semiconductor layer.
00:14:39.360 What happens here is that an electron in that semiconductor layer is going to be released from the veence shell that it's
00:14:46.839 in. We think of the outermost electrons in the outermost orbital that's actually filled with electrons as veence
00:14:53.360 electrons. They fill an energy band known as the veence band. If energy is deposited into that system, those
00:14:59.680 electrons can get enough energy to be released from the veence band and enter what's known as the conduction band.
00:15:05.760 Electrons in the conduction band then have the ability to move along an electrical bias and we've created an
00:15:12.480 electrical potential here between the cathode and the anode. So as that electron is released from the
00:15:18.399 semiconductor layer, it's going to move towards the anode here. It's going to move along that electrical field or that
00:15:25.120 electrical potential. When the electron is released from the veence band, it leaves what's
00:15:32.000 known as an electron hole. And the electron and the electron hole together is known as an electron hole pair. The
00:15:39.120 electron hole is a potential space, a space where an electron can fill. And what we know is that in a specific atom,
00:15:46.160 that electron space will be filled by an adjacent or surrounding electron. There's an energy differential that is
00:15:52.480 being created and an surrounding electron is going to fill that hole.
00:15:57.839 The process of electrons filling that hole means that the electron hole is going to seemingly move towards the
00:16:04.160 cathode. And I'm going to show you exactly how that process works. The movement of the electron holds towards
00:16:09.680 the cathode and the electrons towards the anode is going to create an electrical pulse. And that pulse can be
00:16:16.560 measured by the ASIC. So let's look at that process again. The X-ray hits the semiconductor layer. Electron holes
00:16:23.360 travel towards the cathode and electrons travel towards the anode. Let's zoom in
00:16:29.279 on the structure of the semiconductor layer. You can see this crystal latice that's been formed in the semiconductor
00:16:35.519 layer. It's a highly organized tightly packed structure. And I want to give you an extremely basic diagrammatic
00:16:41.360 representation of electrons sitting within this structured crystal layer. When an X-ray is incident on this
00:16:47.680 crystal layer, we get say the photoelectric effect or Compton scatter that causes an electron to be ejected
00:16:53.600 into the conduction band. It's not just one electron. It's a cloud of electrons.
00:16:59.040 We get in the order of tens of thousands of electrons that are being released within this layer. That release of the
00:17:04.640 electron results in a cascade of electrons being released and we call it an electron cloud. Notice how that
00:17:09.839 electron cloud is headed towards the anode. Now we can see the electron holes in this diagram. Which electrons are
00:17:17.119 going to fill these holes? Well, because of the potential that we've created across this semiconductor layer. It's
00:17:22.959 these electrons that are going to move towards the anode and fill the hole. As
00:17:28.160 they move towards the anode, look how the electron holes are effectively moving towards the cathode. Now, the
00:17:34.480 electron holes aren't particles themselves. They're just potential spaces. And you see now those electron
00:17:40.000 holes are moved towards the cathode ultimately creating that electrical pulse. Let's look at that more in real
00:17:46.160 time. You'll see that the interactions often happen closer to the cathode. Electron holes move slower than
00:17:52.480 electrons move. And that's why the cathode is on the patient side of our detector and the anode is on the
00:17:57.679 computer side of our detector. So watch how this happens. Photoelectric effect or compant scatter. The hole looks like
00:18:04.640 it's moving towards the cathode and the electrons actually do move towards the anode. You can watch that again. X-ray
00:18:10.559 coming in, electron cloud being released and holes moving towards the cathode. That's the foundation for photon
00:18:16.799 counting CT. Now we can have X-rays of different energies reaching our detector and that
00:18:23.440 electron cloud that is released is going to be proportional to those X-ray energies. And ultimately the electrical
00:18:29.280 impulse is going to be proportional to the incident X-ray energy. And that's how we can not only discern separate
00:18:35.679 X-rays, but we can also calculate the energy of those X-rays. And that's the
00:18:41.679 major key to photon counting is we got much more spectral information. We've got much better information about the
00:18:47.280 energy of the X-rays that have hit our detector. Photon counting detectors not only count X-rays, but they bin the
00:18:54.320 X-rays based on the degree of energy that they have. we can separate the X-rays into multiple different energy
00:18:59.760 bins, high energy, medium energy, low energy bins, and actually X-rays maybe that are so low energy that we want to
00:19:05.039 remove from our sample. So hopefully you can see that photon counting detectors are going to provide us with much more
00:19:10.880 information than conventional CT detectors. That's going to lead to a range of benefits and we're going to go
00:19:16.240 through some of those benefits here or advantages of photon counting CT. Say X-rays have been incident on a specific
00:19:18.000 No text
00:19:23.200 detector, just one of our detectors, and we've read out the information with our ASIC here. We can see the number of
00:19:29.440 X-ray photons, and we can see the incident energy of those X-ray photons based on the area under each one of
00:19:35.360 these curves. The first advantage of photon counting CT, and I've mentioned it, is this intrinsic energy
00:19:42.200 discrimination. We looked at dual energy CT. We said that we could have two separate average energy X-ray sources
00:19:50.160 applied to the patient, whether that's alternating X-ray sources or orthogonal X-ray sources. And we can see that
00:19:56.320 different tissues respond to different X-ray energies based on their tissue
00:20:02.240 composition. Bone is going to respond very differently to a change in X-ray energy, say to liver. And based on those
00:20:08.960 changes in response or changes in houndsfield units to different X-ray energies, we could separate out those
00:20:14.880 tissues in post-processing. But we only had two X-ray energy sources. And they
00:20:19.919 were actually different X-ray spectrums heading towards the patient. What we can do in photon counting CT is separate
00:20:27.200 each one of these X-rays into individual energy categories. Now, we've not only
00:20:32.559 got jewel energy sources, we've got multiple energy sources depending on how well we can discriminate the different
00:20:38.960 energy levels, and we can use each one of these. We can say we're only going to use the data from X-rays in this energy
00:20:46.240 bin here, and see how the tissues respond. Now, let's see how different the image looks, how different the
00:20:52.559 houndsfield values are if we use X-rays only in this X-ray bin, this X-ray energy bin. And based on those changes
00:20:59.919 in Houndsfield units, we can make assumptions about the tissues within the patient. And we can much better separate
00:21:05.760 out individual tissues. Perhaps we're going to get to a stage where we can really easily separate out tissues with
00:21:12.159 very subtle Houndsfield unit differences based on our ability to have intrinsic
00:21:17.760 energy discrimination in photon counting CT. Next, we've got a much improved
00:21:23.919 spatial resolution. You'll see here in our example the detector the anode here is much smaller than our conventional CT
00:21:30.880 detector which is much larger. We've got limiting factors with conventional CT detectors. One based on the scepter, two
00:21:38.400 based on the electrical components that are needed and the fill factor and three based on how large the photosensitive
00:21:44.799 area is. We need to have a certain size of photosensitive area to get enough signal that's going to be able to
00:21:50.960 separate signal from noise because we don't need those scepter and we don't need electronics on the top of our anode
00:21:57.919 here. We've got much smaller detector elements. and actually reducing the size
00:22:03.600 of the detector elements, reducing the size of each one of those anode pixels, it's actually going to be advantageous
00:22:09.120 for photon counting CT because the total number of photons hitting each anode is
00:22:14.240 going to be reduced and we're going to better be able to discriminate out those X-rays. And you'll see when I talk about some of the challenges we're facing in
00:22:20.559 photon CT, why that becomes important. We've also got a much better ability to deal with dose. You see, when the X-rays
00:22:28.640 are converted into light, there's a an inefficiency there. there's a loss of energy. So, we're going to need higher
00:22:33.760 exposure to get the same degree of signal as we would in the photon counting CT. Again, I've mentioned this
00:22:39.760 now multiple times. There's dead space where X-ray incident X-ray photons are going to produce light that don't even
00:22:45.760 contribute to our signal. We'll see later how noise is much less in photon
00:22:50.880 counting CT. We don't need as high a dose and the noise really predominates at lower doses. And if we have a good
00:22:56.720 ability to reduce the amount of noise, we can actually use lower doses. So it's better dose efficiency in photon
00:23:02.720 counting CT. So how then do we go about actually reducing the noise? I said an advantage of photon counting CT is noise
00:23:09.320 reduction. Well, it's a function of this intrinsic energy discrimination. We know
00:23:14.720 that noise occurs at high frequencies and at low X-ray energies. It gets confused with low X-ray energy photons.
00:23:21.520 What we can do is we can apply a threshold and say, you know what, X-ray energies under a certain point we're not
00:23:27.200 going to use in our image. That's going to get rid of the noise within our image. We can still manipulate the data
00:23:33.120 that we have here, especially because of the different energy bins to create an image that has still sharp resolution
00:23:39.679 and high signal, a good signal to noise ratio, but we've drastically reduced the amount of noise by not including those
00:23:45.520 lower energy X-ray photons. Conventional CC just has a total sum of X-rays that hit it. It can't take out lower energy
00:23:53.120 photons and include higher energy photons. That's a major point for noise reduction in photon counting CT. The
00:24:00.559 electronics here also have less electronic noise as opposed to photon counting CT because each one of our data
00:24:07.120 points are much smaller. We're not accumulating a whole load of data and then amplifying that signal as we
00:24:12.799 release it out towards our detector. Not only can we reduce noise, but we can actually reduce many artifacts that we
00:24:18.240 get with conventional computer tomography. Here, what I've tried to represent is a beam hardening artifact
00:24:24.000 where we've got a a detector that's getting all of these different X-ray energies. I've just clumped them together. And we've got a predominance
00:24:29.760 of these high X-ray energy photons. And we can know in our algorithm or in our system that our incident X-ray, our
00:24:36.960 average incident X-ray energy is going to be X. We've set the KVP. We've set the MAS. But the average X-ray photons
00:24:44.480 that are hitting our detector are much harder. We can assume that beam hardening has occurred. What we can do
00:24:49.679 because we're able to separate the X-ray energies, discriminate between X-ray energies is we can remove the higher
00:24:55.679 X-ray energies and we can amplify those lower X-ray energy photons and compensate directly at the source for
00:25:02.640 beam hardening. We can say this area had a lot of beam hardening. Let's remove those higher X-ray energy photons that
00:25:08.159 are going to cause algorithms to falsely calculate the Houndsfield L units as lower values. When we got those
00:25:15.279 dark regions between two highly attenuating structures like the Petrus bones, we got darker values between
00:25:20.960 them, lower houndsfield unit values because of that beam hardening. We can prevent that from occurring by removing
00:25:26.960 those harder X-rays, those higher energy X-ray photons. That's one example of how we can remove artifacts in photon
00:25:33.440 counting CT. And because of the sheer volume of data that we're getting, we have potential to address many other
00:25:39.600 artifacts. And that brings me to the final advantage in this talk that we're going to talk about is this enhanced
00:25:44.880 post-processing potential or AI integration. Big data that we now have
00:25:49.919 the ability to manipulated more than the data that we had originally received in conventional computer tomography
00:25:55.440 detectors. We saw in conventional CT detectors we filled a cyoggram and it
00:26:00.799 was this data that we used to generate the image of one slice. Now we're not
00:26:05.840 getting a single reading per detector in each line of the syog. Each detector is
00:26:13.440 outputting multiple different data sets. It's outputting how many X-rays are hitting it and it's outputting the
00:26:20.080 energy of each one of those X-rays. That extra data, as we've seen with some of these steps, is very powerful in
00:26:28.000 post-processing. It's very powerful in us saying what's the tissue composition of each voxil within this image that
00:26:34.240 we're creating. We've got much more information and as a result there's a much higher upside to the potential of
00:26:40.559 the data that we're receiving. So why then doesn't every hospital have a photon counting CT? Well firstly this is
00:26:46.960 a new technology. It was only approved in 2021 by the FDA and obviously new
00:26:50.000 No text
00:26:52.400 technology is expensive. So that's always going to be a prohibiting factor. But there are actually certain
00:26:58.400 challenges that photon counting CT detectors face that we still need to overcome or still need to improve on.
00:27:04.080 The first challenge that we face is what's known as pulse pileup or a count rate limitation. If an X-ray photon hits
00:27:06.000 No text
00:27:10.400 our detector, we get an X-ray pulse and another X-ray photon hits the detector, we get a second pulse. And those pulses
00:27:16.000 are proportional to the X-ray energy. What happens when they hit the detector at very similar times or very close to
00:27:21.760 one another? The two photons strike the detector almost simultaneously. Our output is going to look something like
00:27:28.320 this. We've got overlapping of those electrical impulses and it's very difficult to separate them out. We do
00:27:34.240 have algorithms that can try and separate them out, but those algorithms aren't perfect, especially if you got more than two X-rays hitting the
00:27:40.840 detector. There's a limitation into the rate at which we can differentiate between different X-rays hitting the CT
00:27:47.440 detector. Here, this is what's known as pulse pileup. Now, pulse pileup is subtly different to our second
00:27:53.000 No text
00:27:53.039 challenge, which is known as adjacent pixel charge sharing. Now, we've got one
00:27:58.159 X-ray photon creating a cloud of electrons that head out towards our detector, but they strike two adjacent
00:28:05.279 anodes, and those anodess are going to share that electrical signal. So, instead of the signal that we were
00:28:11.039 expecting for that specific X-ray energy, we've now separated that signal into two adjacent anodes. So we are
00:28:18.559 getting a reduction in spatial resolution and we've got an incorrect signal here. We're going to say that the
00:28:23.679 this X-ray photon was half the X-ray energy that it was truly. So we're not truly representing that X-ray
00:28:31.080 energy. Our third challenge that we're facing is what's known as detector dead time. If an X-ray strikes the detector
00:28:32.000 No text
00:28:36.960 and then another X-ray is incident on that detector close to that initial interaction, we may have a point where
00:28:43.360 that second X-ray is not even registered. It's passed through the detector. there's a very small period of
00:28:48.640 time when that detector or that anode is not sensitive to a second pulse and that's what's known as detector dead
00:28:55.320 time. In an ideal world, the number of photons that were incident on the X-ray
00:28:59.000 No text
00:29:00.399 detector and the number of photons that we actually detect would be the same. If
00:29:05.919 a 100 photons hit the detector, we would want to register 100 photons in our computer. We want a perfect matchup. And
00:29:12.799 that graph would look something like this. a linear graph where the more photons uh incident would equal the more
00:29:18.480 photons detected. In practice, we've got what's known as limited dynamic range.
00:29:23.679 At high X-ray flux, at a high number of incident X-ray photons, we get a
00:29:29.200 disproportional reduction in the amount of photons that we actually register and send to our computer. And that's a
00:29:35.120 function of the dead time and a function of pileup and count rate limitation.
00:29:40.640 What happens here is our graph ends up looking something like this. When we have high photon rates that arrive too
00:29:48.240 quickly at our detector, we aren't able to process each one of those X-rays individually. And not only do we have
00:29:53.279 the dead time or the pulse pileup, but our ability to process the signal, process those electrical impulses that
00:29:59.200 are heading towards the ASC is limited. There's a limited bandwidth there. There's a limited sampling frequency
00:30:04.960 that we have there. If we exceed that, we get this drop off in our dynamic range here. We don't have the ability to
00:30:10.880 truly represent high areas of X-ray flux. And finally, the last challenge that we face is the complexity of this
00:30:18.320 new technology. We don't quite know exactly all of the things that we can do with this current technology. Cost is
00:30:25.360 always going to be prohibitive. And now we're getting so much more data. And that data is going to require much more
00:30:31.679 advanced signal processing. that individual detector is not giving us one readout value per projection like in
00:30:38.000 conventional computer tomography. It's giving us multiple readouts for each and every projection. It's not just a
00:30:43.760 doubling of the amount of data. It's an exponential increase in the amount of data. Manufacturing these components are
00:30:50.000 also much more expensive currently and the hospitals need to justify the cost whether it's beneficial to the hospital
00:30:55.360 or whether it's beneficial to the patient. And because this is a new technology, there aren't that many providers here. We need competition to
00:31:02.399 drive down the cost. And I've included this graph here. This is what's known as Moore's law. And Moore predicted that in
00:31:08.640 the 70s that the number of transistors that are used in a chip is going to double every 2 years. And that's pretty
00:31:14.480 much what has happened over the last 50 years that the chip size has gotten
00:31:19.600 smaller and the number of chips and our processing power has gotten exponentially bigger. This is an
00:31:24.640 exponential uh scale on the y-axis of our graph. Whilst all of the requirement is
00:31:31.600 increasing, we get this drastic reduction in the cost to manufacture these components and we can assume in CT
00:31:38.480 or any technology that we're using in radiology. As our demands increase and as technology gets better, we're going
00:31:45.039 to drive down cost and these kind of technologies are going to become more and more affordable and hopefully the
00:31:50.720 applications that we can use photon counting CT is only going to increase and as I said this has the potential to
00:31:57.360 be a stepwise increase in the technology from conventional computer tomography to photon counting computer tomography. So
00:32:04.000 No text
00:32:04.559 I hope that's made sense. This is just a broad bird's eye view introduction to photon counting CT. As the technology
00:32:11.440 develops, I'm sure we're going to get an expansion of the underlying physics that contribute to this technology. So that
00:32:18.320 brings us to the end of this learning pathway. I really have enjoyed sharing this information with you and I hope the
