    Head and Neck Malignancies. Head and neck cancers
include squamous cell carcinoma of mucosal surfaces and
adenocarcinoma of salivary and lacrimal glands (Fig. 63.28).
PET is superior to CT and MR for the detection of involved
nodes in the neck and distant metastases (Fig. 63.29). PET can
detect occult head and neck malignancy reliably. Up to 15%
of patients with primary head and neck malignancies develop
other malignancies, including lung and esophageal carcino-
mas, which may be detected by PET during initial staging.
Reports show good correlation between the degree of FDG
activity and the prognosis of head and neck malignancies.
Also, reliable early assessment of the response to radiation and
chemotherapy by PET has been reported.

    Physiologic activity in the head and neck is best recognized
by cross-referencing PET-CT scans. Radionuclide activity
may be seen in the salivary glands, from salivary secretions
retained in the gingival recesses and vallecula; in the tonsils
and lymphatic tissues of the Waldeyer ring; and in the tongue
musculature, masticator muscles, and laryngeal musculature.
Swishing the mouth with water prior to scanning can clear
retained saliva. Unilateral laryngeal uptake may signify vocal
cord paralysis caused by recurrent laryngeal nerve damage
or tumor. Dental implants should be removed, if possible, as
they may produce artifacts in the attenuation correction algo-
rithm. Infection and inflammatory processes, especially dental
disease, recent dental procedures, or tracheotomy sites, can
demonstrate FDG activity. Postradiation mucositis, including
esophagitis and gingivitis, produces confusing findings. Benign
tumors, such as Warthin tumor of the salivary gland (papillary
cystadenoma lymphomatosum), can show FDG activity. Post-
therapy bone marrow activation can also produce a confusing
picture.

    PET is excellent for the detection of recurrence, but inter-
pretation of postoperative and postradiation changes is chal-
lenging. Because inflammation in the treatment bed causes
PET activity, posttreatment PET scans are best delayed for 2
to 3 months after treatment.

    Sarcomas and Osseous Malignancies. FDG-PET is very
