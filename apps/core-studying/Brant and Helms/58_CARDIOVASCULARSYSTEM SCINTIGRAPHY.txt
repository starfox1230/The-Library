    Three techniques are in use to reduce the artifactual appear-
ance of fixed defects seen with myocardial perfusion scanning.
One method relies on repeat poststress scanning of the patient
in the prone position with a technetium agent. This changes
the position of the heart, breasts, diaphragm, and the subdia-
phragmatic organs and reduces the appearance of fixed defects
in the appropriate distribution, which may be misinterpreted
as infarctions. Repeat prone positioning may also help with
motion artifacts. Unfortunately, obese patients in whom there
is plenty of breast or subdiaphragmatic attenuation may not
be able to lay prone for this scan (Fig. 56.8).

    Another technique that avoids misinterpretation of fixed
artifactual defects as infarctions relies on gating the acquisi-
tion. This gating technique can be done with planar scans as
well as with SPECT scans. A cine replay of the gated study
allows assessment of wall motion. The normal wall moves
inward during systole, thickens as it contracts, and becomes
