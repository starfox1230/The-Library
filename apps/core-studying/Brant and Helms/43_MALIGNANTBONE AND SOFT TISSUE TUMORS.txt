They most commonly occur in patients older than the age of
40 years. Chondrosarcoma rarely occurs in children, although
occasionally one will be encountered from malignant degen-
eration of an osteochondroma. It can be extremely difficult to
differentiate histologically a low-grade chondrosarcoma from
an enchondroma (2). The diagnosis of chondrosarcoma usu-
ally initiates radical excision and therapy, although it is debat-
able (and somewhat controversial) whether a low-grade
chondrosarcoma is even a malignant tumor. For these reasons,
the diagnosis of "possible chondrosarcoma" should be
reserved for those lesions that are painful (Fig. 41.15) or that

           Malignant Giant Cell Tumor

It is said that approximately 15% of giant cell tumors are
malignant; however, this is based on their rate of recurrence
rather than on the presence of metastatic disease, which is
rare. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be any way to
predict which giant cell tumor will become malignant.
Radiologically, the benign and malignant giant cell tumors
appear identical. Histologically, the benign and the malignant
giant cell tumors appear the same. If metastases (usually to the
lung) occur, the tumor is considered by most oncologists to be
malignant. This is quite rare. Malignant giant cell tumors tend
to occur primarily in the fourth decade of life.

This lytic appearance may take any form, from permeative
(Fig. 41.17) to moth-eaten to a fairly well-defined area of lysis
(Fig. 41.18). The age range for fibrosarcoma is quite broad,
but they tend to predominate in the fourth decade. This is one
of the few malignant tumors that can, on occasion, have a
bony sequestrum.

gists use age 35 for the lower limits of myeloma. Myeloma
typically has a diffuse permeative appearance (Fig. 41.23) that
can mimic a Ewing sarcoma or primary lymphoma of bone.
Because of the age criteria, Ewing sarcoma and myeloma are
not in the same differential, however. Myeloma frequently
involves the calvarium (Fig. 41.24). Rarely, myeloma can pres-
ent with multiple sclerotic foci resembling diffuse metastatic
disease. Myeloma is one of the only lesions that is not charac-
teristically hot on a radionuclide bone scan; therefore, radio-
logic "bone surveys" are performed in place of radionuclide
bone scans when evidence of myeloma is found clinically.
Occasionally, myeloma will present with a lytic bone lesion
called a plasmacytoma. This lesion can mimic any lytic bone
lesion, benign or aggressive, in its appearance; it can precede
other evidence of myeloma by up to 5 years. A plasmacytoma
in a vertebral body has a characteristic appearance called a
"mini-brain" (see Chapter 40, Fig. 41.29).

generally left to giving descriptions of size and extent of the
tumor and letting the pathologist determine the diagnosis.

    Synovial sarcomas (formerly called synoviomas) only very
rarely originate in a joint. They are often adjacent to joints.
There are no malignant tumors that routinely need to be con-
sidered in the differential diagnosis of joint lesions. Synovial
sarcomas are one of two types of tumors (along with neural
tumors) that are typically homogeneously bright on T2WIs--
to the extent that they can be mistaken for a fluid collection.
As mentioned previously, whenever a mass is found on MRI
that resembles a fluid collection in a location that is atypical
for a ganglion or bursa, gadolinium must be given to deter-
mine if it is indeed fluid or a solid mass.

    Synovial osteochondromatosis is a benign joint lesion that
occurs from metaplasia of the synovium and leads to multiple
calcific loose bodies in a joint. This can histologically mimic a
chondrosarcoma and therefore is best diagnosed radiographi-
cally, as it has a pathognomonic radiographic appearance (Fig.
41.25). Up to 20% of the time, the loose bodies do not calcify,
however, and the osteochondromatosis then can mimic pig-
mented villonodular synovitis (PVNS).

    Pigmented villonodular synovitis is a benign synovial soft
tissue process that causes joint swelling and pain and, occa-
sionally, joint erosions (Fig. 41.26). It virtually never has cal-
cifications associated with it. The MR appearance of PVNS
is characteristic. Marked low signal lining the synovium is
seen on T1WI and T2WI because of the hemosiderin deposits
(Fig. 41.27).

    Chronic bleeding into a joint, so-called hemosiderotic
arthritis, could have a similar appearance, but is encountered
uncommonly.

    Hemangiomas will often have phleboliths associated with
them and often cause cortical holes in adjacent bone that
can mimic a permeative or moth-eaten pattern (Fig. 41.28),
