     FIGURE 10.55. Spinal Dysraphism. This series of drawings from Barkovich's text nicely illustrates the range of appear-
     ances of spinal dysraphism. In all of these conditions, there has been failure of the lips of the neural folds to close in the
     midline dorsally, forming a tube. The incompletely fused plaque of neural tissue is referred to as the neural "placode."
     When the placode is covered by intact skin and subcutaneous fat, without dorsal herniation of neural tissue, the defect
     (A and B) may be overlooked in the newborn examination, giving rise to the term "occult spinal dysraphism." A. Spinal
     lipoma. The dorsal spinal cord has failed to close, with an intradural lipoma situated between the lips of the unfused
     placode. The MR and CT appearance of this defect is shown in Figure 10.54. B. Lipomyelocele. The dorsal dura is
     incomplete. The subarachnoid space lies ventral to the placode, which is covered by pia and arachnoid on its internal
     surface. The subcutaneous fat is contiguous with a lipoma, which is adherent to the dorsal surface of the placode. C.
     Lipomyelomeningocele. This is similar to the lipomyelocele (B), except there the subarachnoid space is dilated, causing
     the placode to bulge posteriorly. In this drawing, the lipoma is asymmetric and extends into the canal on the left, rotat-
     ing the placode and causing discrepancy in the length of the nerve roots, which complicates surgical repair.
     Lipomyelomeningoceles are seen in conjunction with rostral craniospinal abnormalities in the Chiari II syndrome. D.
     Myelocele. The neural placode is contiguous with the skin and will be obvious on newborn examination. The ventral
     aspect of the placode has the same anatomy as the lipomyelocele. E. Meningomyelocele. The ventral subarachnoid space
     is dilated, displacing the placode posteriorly (as in lipomyelomeningocele). Otherwise, the defect is identical to a myelo-
     cele. (From Barkovich AJ, ed. Pediatric Neuroimaging. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2005:709-724.)

     FIGURE 10.68. Epidural Hematoma. T1 sagittal (A) and axial (B) images show a bright epidural mass (arrows) consistent with
     a hematoma in the methemoglobin stage. An epidural hematoma can occur in the face of normal radiographs and must be sus-
     pected if there is neurologic compromise.

FIGURE 10.69. Nerve Root Avulsion. A. Coronal T1-weighted image shows a low signal collection in the right epidural space in the midcervical
spine (arrow), consistent with CSF that has leaked through avulsed nerve root sleeves. Intact spinal nerves (arrowheads) are seen in the upper
cervical canal bilaterally traversing through the normal epidural fat. B. A CT myelogram confirms the absence of the right-sided nerve roots and
the CSF leak (arrow). Note the normal roots on the left outlined by myelographic contrast (arrowheads).
