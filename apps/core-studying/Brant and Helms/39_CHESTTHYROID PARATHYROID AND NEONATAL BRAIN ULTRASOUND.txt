Benign Thyroid Nodules. Adenomatous nodules, also

called colloid nodules, are the most common thyroid nodule.
They are not neoplasms but benign growths resulting from
cycles of hyperplasia and involution of thyroid tissue. They
are usually multiple and associated with diffuse enlargement
of the thyroid gland. Individual nodules are isoechoic or
hypoechoic to thyroid parenchyma and commonly show
degenerative changes with prominent cystic components,
necrosis, hemorrhage, and calcification (Fig. 38.11).
