lymphomas, which are more indolent and have a better prog-
nosis than B-cell lymphomas (7). Because lymphoma remains
confined to the bowel wall for prolonged periods of time, it
has a better prognosis than carcinoma with a 5-year survival
rate of 62% to 90%. Lymphoma demonstrates four morpho-
logic patterns: polypoid solitary mass, ulcerative mass, mul-
tiple submucosal nodules (Fig. 29.7), and diffuse infiltration
(Fig. 29.8). UGI findings include the following: (1) polypoid
lesions, (2) irregular ulcers with nodular thickened folds, (3)
bulky tumors with large cavities, (4) multiple submucosal nod-
ules that commonly ulcerate and create a target or "bull's-eye"
appearance, (5) diffuse but pliable wall and fold thickening,
and (6) rarely, linitis plastica appearance of diffuse, stiff nar-
rowing (Fig. 29.8) (7). Multiplicity of lesions favors MALT
lymphoma as the diagnosis.

    CT is the primary imaging modality used to stage lym-
phoma. CT findings that are helpful in differentiating gastric
lymphoma from carcinoma include (1) more marked thicken-
ing of the wall (may exceed 3 cm) (Fig. 29.9), (2) involve-
ment of additional areas of the GI tract (trans-pyloric spread
of lymphoma to the duodenum in 30%), (3) absence of inva-
sion of the perigastric fat, (4) absence of luminal narrowing
and obstruction despite extensive involvement, and (5) more
widespread and bulkier adenopathy (10).

    GI stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mes-
enchymal tumors to arise from the GI tract (11,12). Most,
but not all, tumors previously classified as leiomyomas,

In the duodenal bulb, 90% of tumors are benign. In the second
and third portions of the duodenum, tumors are 50% benign
and 50% malignant. In the fourth portion of the duodenum,
most tumors are malignant. Small, benign tumors of the duo-
denum usually present as smooth, polypoid filling defects. CT
is helpful, but not specific, in predicting malignancy. Biopsy is
required. Signs of malignancy include the following: (1) central
necrosis, (2) ulceration or excavation, (3) exophytic or intra-
mural mass, and (4) evidence of tumor beyond the duodenum.

    Duodenal adenocarcinoma, although being the most fre-
quent malignant tumor of the duodenum, is a rare lesion
(1.5% of GI neoplasms). Malignant tumors are most com-
mon in the periampullary region and are rare in the bulb.
Morphologic patterns include polypoid mass, ulcerative mass,
and annular constricting lesion. Metastases to regional lymph
nodes are present in two-thirds of patients at presentation.
