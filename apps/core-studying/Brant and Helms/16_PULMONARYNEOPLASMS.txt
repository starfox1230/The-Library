and a pleural tail extending from the tumor toward the pleural
surface. The diffuse form may present as lobar or multilobar
airspace opacification (Fig. 15.13) or as diffuse bilateral air-
space nodules. These latter appearances may be indistinguish-
able from pneumonia or edema, although the clinical findings,
chronicity of the process, and cytologic examination of spu-
tum and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens should provide
the correct diagnosis. The production of copious amounts of
mucus by these tumors may be an occasional clinical feature.
An additional finding on contrast-enhanced CT in patients
with the diffuse form of BAC is the so-called "CT angiogram"
sign within consolidated areas. In these patients, filling of the
airspaces with mucoid material produced by the malignant
cells creates low-density airspace opacification surrounding
the enhanced PAs that traverses the consolidated regions.

caused by metastasis are typically smooth in contour, whereas
primary bronchogenic tumors tend to be lobulated or spicu-

tasis in a patient with a synchronous extrathoracic malignancy
is slightly less than 50%, whereas SPNs in patients with prior
malignancies are almost always primary bronchogenic tumors
or granulomas. However, the site of the primary tumor may
affect the likelihood that an SPN is a metastasis. Carcinomas
of the rectosigmoid colon, osteogenic sarcoma, renal cell car-
cinoma, and melanoma are more likely to result in solitary
pulmonary metastases. It should be cautioned that what may
appear as a solitary metastasis on plain radiographs may be

    Nodular pulmonary metastases are usually smooth or
lobulated lesions that are found in greater numbers in the
peripheral portions of the lower lobes because of the greater
pulmonary blood flow to these regions. Helical CT is the
