   geal cartilage and runs parallel to the remainder of the cervical vertebrae. Line 2 demarcates the anterior
   border of the cervical vertebral bodies. Line 3 is the posterior border of the cervical vertebral bodies. Line
   4 is drawn by connecting the junction of the lamina at the spinous process, which is called the spinolami-
   nar line. It represents the posterior extent of the central canal that contains the spinal cord itself. These
   lines should be generally smooth and parallel with no abrupt step-offs.

    Anterior wedge compression fractures of the spine are com-
monly seen (Fig. 42.14), especially at the thoraco-lumbar junc-
tion, due to an old injury; they are passed off by the radiologist,
if they are mentioned at all, as incidental findings. The problem
with this is you cannot tell from a plain film if the fracture is
old or new, even if degenerative changes are present (which
are often not related to the fracture). If acute and left unpro-
tected, a wedge compression fracture can proceed to delayed
further collapse with resulting severe neurologic deficits (Fig.
42.15). This is called Kummell disease and typically occurs 1
to 2 weeks after the initial trauma. Multiple lawsuits have been
filed against radiologists who failed to mention minor anterior
wedging of a vertebral body, which went on to further collapse
with associated paraplegia. All that needs to be mentioned is
that a fracture is present, which is of indeterminate age and

requires clinical correlation. If the patient has pain in that loca-
tion, a back brace needs to be worn until they are pain-free.
Old films can help determine if it is an old fracture. If no pain is
present on physical exam, it can be safely assumed to be an old
fracture. It is not necessary to obtain a CT or MRI even if pain
is present, because the treatment will be the same regardless of
what the CT or MRI reveal. No spine surgeon will operate on
a stable spine fracture without kyphosis or neurologic deficits,
so the CT or MRI adds nothing but time and expense.

    Patients who have fusion of their spine from ankylosing
spondylitis and, to a lesser extent, from DISH (diffuse idio-
pathic skeletal hyperostosis) are at a very high risk of spinal
fractures from even relatively minor trauma. Patients with
ankylosing spondylitis typically have marked osteoporosis
that further magnifies their risk of fracture. A fused spine is
more likely to fracture than a normal spine in a manner simi-
lar to a long glass pipette breaking more easily than a short
one because it has a long lever arm. A small force at one end
is greatly magnified further down the lever arm. For that rea-
son, a patient with ankylosing spondylitis should be treated as
though a spinal fracture is present if they have back pain fol-
lowing trauma. CT and/or MRI are mandatory if plain films
are negative (Fig. 42.16).

    If avascular necrosis of the navicular develops, it is the
proximal fragment that undergoes necrosis because the blood
supply to the navicular begins distally and runs proximally. A
fracture with disruption of the blood supply thus leaves the
proximal pole without a vascular supply, and hence, it dies.
Avascular necrosis is diagnosed by noting increased density of

    Avascular necrosis can occur in other carpal bones, most
commonly the lunate. This is called Kienböck malacia and is
most often caused by trauma; however, it is also thought to be
idiopathic. It is diagnosed by noting the increased density in
the lunate, which may or may not go on to collapse and frag-
mentation (Fig. 42.30). It often requires surgical bone grafting
and occasionally removal or proximal carpal row fusion. It
has a high association with a discrepancy between the length
of the radius and the ulna as seen at the radiocarpal joint. If the
ulna is shorter than the radius, it is termed negative ulnar vari-
ance and there is an increased incidence of Kienböck malacia
(Fig. 42.30). If the ulna is longer than the radius, it is termed
positive ulnar variance and there is an increased incidence of
triangular fibrocartilage tears.

    A common avulsion fracture in the wrist is a triquetral frac-
ture. It is best seen on a lateral film, which shows a small chip
of bone off the dorsum of the wrist (Fig. 42.31). This is virtu-
ally pathognomonic of an avulsion from the triquetrum.

Colles Fracture. One of the most common fractures of the
forearm is a fracture of the distal radius and ulna after a fall on
an outstretched arm. This results in a dorsal angulation of the
distal forearm and wrist and is called a Colles fracture (Fig.
42.32). When the fracture angulates volarly, it is called a Smith
fracture (Fig. 42.33). A Smith fracture is a much less common
occurrence than a Colles fracture. Sometimes the radius and

fracture. The dislocated radial head can be missed clinically
and develop into avascular necrosis with subsequent elbow
dysfunction. Whenever the forearm is fractured, the elbow
must be examined to exclude a dislocation.

    Galeazzi Fracture. A fracture of the radius with dislocation
of the distal ulna is called a Galeazzi fracture (Fig. 42.36). This
is less common than a Monteggia fracture.

    Elbow Fractures. A helpful indicator of a fracture about
the elbow is a displaced posterior fat pad. Ordinarily, the
posterior fat pad is not visible on a lateral view of the elbow
because it is tucked away in the olecranon fossa of the distal
humerus. When the joint becomes distended with blood sec-
ondary to a fracture, the posterior fat pad is displaced out
of the olecranon fossa and is visible on the lateral view (Fig.
42.37A). Therefore, in the setting of trauma, a visible poste-
rior fat pad indicates a fracture. In an adult (epiphyses closed),
the fracture site is almost always the radial head (Fig. 42.37B).
In a child (epiphyses open), it is usually indicative of a supra-
condylar fracture (Fig. 42.38).

    Often, the fracture itself is not visualized, and extraordinary
steps are taken by clinicians and radiologists alike to demonstrate
                                                                         Chapter 42: Skeletal Trauma  1031

elbow that in an adult should be in the radial head. B. An oblique

view shows the fracture of the radial head (arrow). Even without

seeing the fracture on the radiographs, it should be surmised to

be present when the posterior fat pad is visualized in the setting

not matter whether the fracture is definitely identified or not in
a patient with a posttraumatic painful elbow and a visible pos-
terior fat pad. An infection, an arthritide, or any elbow effusion
could cause a joint effusion and a displaced posterior fat pad, but
the clinical setting would not be to rule out a fracture.

    The anterior fat pad also gets displaced with a joint effu-
sion. Ordinarily it is visible as a small triangle just anterior to
the distal humeral diaphysis on a lateral film (Fig. 42.39). With
an effusion, it gets displaced superiorly and outward from the
humerus and has been called a "sail sign" because it resembles
a spinnaker sail (see Figs. 42.37, 42.38).

    Shoulder dislocations are generally easily diagnosed, both
clinically and radiographically. The most common shoulder
dislocation is the anterior dislocation. It is at least 10 times
more common than a posterior dislocation. For all practical
purposes, anterior and posterior dislocations are the only two
types of shoulder dislocations about which to be concerned.

    An anterior dislocation occurs when the arm is forcibly
externally rotated and abducted. This is commonly seen when
football players "arm tackle," when kayakers "brace" with
the paddle above their heads and allow their arms to get too
far posterior, when skiers plant their uphill pole and get it
stuck, and from other similar athletic positions. Radiographi-
cally, the diagnosis is easily made on an AP shoulder film: the
humeral head is seen to lie inferiorly and medial to the glenoid
(Fig. 42.40). The humeral head often impacts on the inferior
lip of the glenoid causing an indentation on the posterosupe-
rior portion of the humeral head; this is called a Hill-Sachs
deformity. The presence of a Hill-Sachs deformity is said to

pathologic fracture.

    Avulsion injuries affect the pelvis quite often and should
be easily recognized by radiologists. On occasion, an avulsion
injury can have an aggressive appearance and, if not diagnosed
radiographically, a biopsy might be performed. This can be
calamitous as avulsion injuries have been known to mimic
malignant lesions histologically, with a misdiagnosis leading
to radical treatment (Fig. 42.50). Therefore, when an avulsion
injury is a consideration, it becomes a "do not touch" lesion
(see Chapter 45). Common sites for pelvic avulsions include
the ischium, the superior and inferior anterior iliac spines (Fig.
42.51), and the iliac crest. These injuries are said to be fairly
common in long jumpers, sprinters, hurdlers, gymnasts, and
cheerleaders.

    Another area in the pelvis that can demonstrate radio-
logic findings as a result of stress is the symphysis pubis. In
ultramarathoners, cross-country skiers, soccer players, and
other athletes, the symphysis can be affected by degenerative
joint disease (DJD) or osteoarthritis (Fig. 42.52). The hall-
marks of DJD are sclerosis, joint space narrowing, and osteo-
phytosis. In certain joints, however, erosions can occur as a
result of DJD. These joints include the temporomandibular
joint, the acromioclavicular joint, the symphysis pubis, and
the sacroiliac joint.

across the tibia on this T1-weighted coronal image, which is characteristic for a stress fracture. No significant soft tis-
sue mass was found. The patient's recent history included an increase in his jogging. A stress fracture was diagnosed on
