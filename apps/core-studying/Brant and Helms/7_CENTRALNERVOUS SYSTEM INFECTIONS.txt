with hematogenous spread, usually from pulmonary disease.

    Coccidioidomycosis is caused by the soil fungus Coccid-
ioides immitis, which is found in the southwestern United States
and Northern Mexico. The spores are inhaled, with outbreaks
occurring after groundbreaking for construction projects. Most
infected patients are asymptomatic or have mild respiratory
symptoms. Less than 1% of patients develop disseminated infec-
tion and meningitis. Focal parenchymal granulomas are rare.

    Blastomycosis is caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis,
which is found in damp soil along the Ohio and Mississippi
River valleys. CNS involvement occurs in 6% to 33% of dis-
seminated infection. Meningitis is the most frequent presen-
tation, but parenchymal abscesses and granulomas occur more
frequently than with coccidioidomycosis. Epidural granulomas
and abscesses also occur in the head and spine, usually from
direct extension from adjacent sites of osteomyelitis. Up to
40% of focal brain lesions are multiple.

    Histoplasmosis is usually seen in patients who are asymp-
tomatic or present with a benign pulmonary infection. The
causative pathogen is another soil fungus Histoplasma capsu-
latum, which is also found in the Ohio and Mississippi River
valleys. Disseminated infection is unusual, and only a small
percent of disseminated cases involve the CNS, where men-
ingitis is most common. Multiple or solitary granulomas may
occur. Abscesses rarely develop.

    As seen with CT or MR, most fungal granulomas are small
and show solid or thick rim enhancement (Fig. 6.20) similar to
tuberculomas. Fungal abscesses (as sometimes seen with blas-
tomycosis) have an appearance similar to that of the bacterial

FLAIR images in the temporal lobes with a predilection for the
hippocampus and insular cortex, but sparing of the subjacent
putamen. This is best appreciated on FLAIR sequences (Figs.
6.29B, C and 6.30A). The frontal lobes, and cingulate gyrus in
particular, may also be involved. Swelling with mass effect can
be seen. Reduced diffusion on DWI is often present (Fig. 6.30B).
Early on, meningeal enhancement may be seen. Parenchymal
enhancement or subtle evidence of hemorrhage may present
later (Fig. 6.30C). The differential diagnosis includes middle
cerebral artery infarction (which follows a vascular distribu-
tion), other viral encephalitides, postictal changes, and infiltrat-
ing glioma.

    Varicella zoster virus (VZV) rarely does cause an encepha-
litis that can be similar to that caused by herpes simplex. Neu-
rologic symptoms typically follow an illness with skin rash,
and VZV encephalitis has a more multifocal distribution and
less predilection for temporal lobe involvement than seen with
HSV-1. VZV is also the cause of herpes zoster ophthalmicus,
which can be complicated ipsilateral cerebral angiitis causing
cerebral infarction and contralateral hemiparesis. Neuroim-
aging studies show typical infarcts, and angiography shows
segmental areas of narrowing and/or beading of large and
medium-sized arteries. Mycotic aneurysms may develop. The
brainstem can also be involved. VZV may infect any of the cra-
nial nerves, but CN VII and VIII are most commonly involved
and result in herpes zoster oticus (Ramsay Hunt syndrome).
Clinically, there is ear pain and facial paralysis, accompanied
by a vesicular eruption about the ear. CT scans are usually
normal, but MR of the internal auditory canals should reveal
abnormal enhancement of one or both of these cranial nerves.

up to 90% of AIDS patients at autopsy. Clinical symptoms
of brain involvement by HIV occur in a minority of these
patients. Primary HIV infection of the brain results in vacuola-
tion of the white matter, with areas of demyelination and mul-
tinucleated giant cells. The centrum semiovale is most severely
involved, but all white matter tracts, including the brainstem
and cerebellum, may be affected. The cortical gray matter is
usually spared. Clinically, patients with HIV encephalitis may
develop a subcortical dementia with cognitive, behavioral, and
motor deterioration. This is known as AIDS dementia com-
plex (ADC) in adults, which is seen in 5% to 30% of vari-
ous groups of AIDS patients, depending on the availability
of HAART. On the other hand, HIV-associated progressive
encephalopathy (HPE) is used to describe infants and children
with HIV encephalitis who exhibit loss of developmental mile-
stones, apathy, failure of brain growth and myelination, and
spastic paraparesis. Children with HPE exhibit less frequent
CNS opportunistic infections and neoplasms compared to
adults with ADC.

    Diffuse atrophy is the most common manifestation of HIV
infection of the brain on neuroimaging studies (Fig. 6.34). This
is largely central atrophy, reflecting the predominant white
matter involvement. White matter lesions are also commonly
seen in patients with ADC. MR is significantly more sensitive
than CT for detecting these abnormalities. A diffuse symmetric
ill-defined often hazy pattern of T2-hyperintensity in the deep
and periventricular white matter, or multiple small T2-hyperin-
tense white matter lesions are the most common findings. The
punctate lesions do not correlate well with symptoms. No mass
