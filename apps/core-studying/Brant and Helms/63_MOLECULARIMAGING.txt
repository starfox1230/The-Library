             INTRODUCTION                                                 Molecular imaging exploits diverse methods and concepts,

Molecular imaging has recently been defined as "the visual-           modalities, chemistry, physics, nanotechnology, pharmacol-

FIGURE 61.15. Potential Molecular Imaging Targets in Atherosclerosis. White boxes show putative targets for molecular
imaging of atherosclerosis. Atherogenesis involves recruitment of inflammatory cells from blood, represented by the mono-
cyte in the upper-left-hand corner of this diagram. Monocytes are the most numerous leukocytes in atherosclerotic plaque.
Recruitment depends on the expression of adhesion molecules on macrovascular endothelium, as shown, and on plaque
microvessels. Once resident in the arterial intima, activated macrophages become phagocytically active, a process that
provides another potential target for plaque imaging. Oxidatively modified low-density lipoprotein (mLDL)-associated
epitopes that accumulate in plaques may also serve as targets for molecular imaging. Foam cells may exhibit increased
metabolic activity, augmenting their uptake of glucose, a process already measurable in the clinic by 18F-FDG uptake.
Activated phagocytes can also elaborate protein-degrading enzymes that can catabolize collagen in the plaque's fibrous
cap, weakening it and rendering it susceptible to rupture and hence thrombosis. Mononuclear phagocytes dying by apop-
tosis in plaques display augmented levels of PS on their surface. Probes for apoptosis such as Annexin V may also visualize
complicated atheromata. Microvessels themselves can express not only leukocyte adhesion molecules (shown in green) but
also integrins such as V3. Proof-of-principle experiments in animals support each process or molecule in white boxes as
target for molecular imaging agents. (Adapted from Libby P, DiCarli M, Weissleder R. The vascular biology of atheroscle-

    All of the previously discussed molecular imaging applica-
tions such as angiogenesis, hypoxia, cell proliferation, gene
reporter, antisense, apoptosis, antibodies, affibodies, integrins,
natural ligands, metabolism, cell trafficking, and cytotoxic
drugs imaging can be translated to clinical tumor imaging in
humans. Some of the potential targets in oncological molecu-
lar imaging are shown in Fig. 61.17.

FIGURE 61.17. Some of the Potential Targets in Oncology Molecular Imaging. Objects that can be imaged in vivo include different cell types
like tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), cytotoxic T cells (CTL), regulatory T cells (Treg), and carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF), as well
as molecular targets (or parameters) for which specific probes have been designed (indicated in red)--basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF),
colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) (also known as M-CSF), CXC-chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), epidermal growth factor (EGF), EGF recep-
tor (EGFR), interferon- (IFN-), interleukin (IL), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), phosphati-
dylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K), reactive oxygen species (ROS), transforming growth factor- (TGF-), endothelial tyrosine kinase (TIE2)
(also known as TEK), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (UPA), vascular cell-adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1),
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), vascular volume fraction (VVF). (Adapted from Weissleder R, Pittet MJ. Imaging in the era of
