   the normal uterus (U). The endometrium (between arrowheads) is more echo-

   three-layer appearance of proliferative phase endometrium. The cervix (C) pro-

   trudes into the upper vagina (V) at the intersection between the long axis of the

   uterus and the axis of the vagina. B. Transvaginal sagittal plane image of the

   uterus demonstrates the improved resolution of this technique. The endometrium

   (between arrowheads) is more sharply defined and the myometrium is more

   clearly evaluated. This image demonstrates the typical uniformly echogenic

   appearance of secretory phase endometrium. C. Transvaginal sagittal plane

   image shows a retroflexed uterus. The uterine fundus (F) is directed posteriorly

   (p) toward the sacrum. Note the change in orientation when the transducer is

   placed endovaginally. The patient's head (h) is located toward the bottom of the

   image; her feet (f ) are located toward the top of the image; her anterior abdomi-

   nal wall (a) is located to the left of the image; and her sacrum is located posteri-

   orly (p) toward the right of the image. This patient is at day 5 of her menstrual

   cycle, having just completed menstruation. Her endometrium (between arrow-

particularly useful in the differentiation of submucous leiomy-

myomas may result from atrophy, internal hemorrhage, cystic

    Paraovarian cysts account for 10% to 20% of all adnexal
masses. They arise from remnants of the Wolffian duct and
are covered by layers of the broad ligament. They have the
appearance of a simple cyst separate from the ovary, thin-
walled, unilocular, well-defined, containing anechoic fluid.

    Peritoneal inclusion cysts are relatively common inflam-
matory pseudocysts of the peritoneal cavity that result from
adhesions that envelop an ovary (26). Diseased peritoneum
loses its ability to absorb fluid. Secretions from an active ovary
confined by adhesions produce an expanding pelvic fluid col-
lection. Patients present with pain or a pelvic mass. Most
have a history of previous pelvic surgery, infection, trauma,
or endometriosis. US demonstrates a complex collection of
fluid occupying pelvic recesses and containing the ovary (Fig.
36.24). The presence of the ovary within or at the periphery
of the mass is critical to the correct diagnosis. Septations,
loculations, and particulate matter within contained fluid are
common.

    Polycystic ovary syndrome is a clinical and biochemical
diagnosis based on the findings of oligo- or anovulation, clini-
cal and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism),
and polycystic ovaries (27). US only defines the morphology
of the ovaries and does not by itself confirm or exclude the
diagnosis. Polycystic ovaries are enlarged and contain multiple

    Scrotal Fluid Collections. A hydrocele is the accumulation
of serous fluid between the visceral and parietal layers of the
tunica vaginalis (Figs. 36.28, 36.30) (38). It is the most com-
mon cause of painless scrotal swelling. Although many cases
are idiopathic, hydrocele may accompany malignant tumors,
torsion, and inflammation. Hematoceles result from trauma or
surgery. Pyoceles usually result from rupture of an abscess into
the space between the layers of the tunica vaginalis. Internal
septations and loculations are common with hematoceles and
pyoceles.
