labeled leukocyte imaging include the following.

    Fever of Undetermined Origin. As mentioned previously,
because of its diverse etiologies, it can be argued that the non-
specific tracer, Ga-67, is the preferred radionuclide test for
FUO. There are data, however, that In-WBC imaging is more
sensitive early in the course of an illness, whereas Ga-67 is
more sensitive later in the illness, and thus, the selection of
the procedure might be governed by the duration of the ill-
ness. When contemplating performing both studies, it is pref-
erable to begin with an In-WBC study and follow with Ga-67
if needed (Fig. 60.16). The rationale for this approach is as
follows. The energies of the photons emitted by and the physi-
cal half-lives of these two tracers are similar. The amount of
activity injected for Ga-67 typically is 10 or more times the
amount of activity injected for an In-WBC study. Should the
In-WBC study fail to provide a diagnosis, the patient can be
injected with Ga-67 and scanned 48 to 72 hours later. If In-
WBC is performed after Ga-67, however, it is necessary to
wait a minimum of 1 week to obtain diagnostically useful
images (2).
