    Rheumatoid arthritis in large joints is fairly characteristic
in that it causes marked joint space narrowing and is associ-
ated with osteoporosis. Erosions might or might not be present
and tend to be marginal, that is, away from the weight-bearing
portion of the joint. In the hip, the femoral head tends to
migrate axially, whereas in osteoarthritis, it tends to migrate
superolaterally (Figs. 43.7, 43.8). In the shoulder, the humeral
head tends to be "high-riding" (Fig. 43.9). Other things to
think of when confronted with a high-riding shoulder are a
torn rotator cuff and CPPD (Table 43.5).

the DJD caused by CPPD that will help distinguish it from
DJD caused by trauma or overuse, however. The main dif-

for the shoulder, the elbow (Fig. 43.27), the radiocarpal

the knee, and the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints in the

is eroding the medial aspect of the humerus. Coronal proton-density (B) and T2WIs (C) of the shoulder reveal a large mass encircl-

a forequarter amputation. The intra-articular nature of the mass was not appreciated until after the radical surgery, when it was

lucency often develops, which forms a thin line along the artic-
ular surface (Fig. 43.46). This lucent line has been described
as being an early indicator for AVN, whereas, in fact, it is a
late finding. Also, the lucent line stage is often not present in
the evolution of AVN. Therefore, using the lucent line as one
of the main criteria for AVN can lead to missing early findings
in some cases and missing the diagnosis completely in others.

    The final sign in AVN is collapse of the articular surface
and joint fragmentation (Fig. 43.47). I must stress that these
changes all occur on only one side of a joint, which makes for
an easy diagnosis because almost everything else around joints
involves both sides of the joint.

    MR is extremely useful in evaluating AVN. It is the most
sensitive imaging study available, often showing AVN when
plain films or radionuclide scans are normal (5). In the hip,
AVN typically has an area of low signal or mixed signal on
T1WIs, which is located in the anterosuperior portion of the
femoral head (Figs. 43.48, 43.49). If the anterior portion of
the femoral head is not involved, the diagnosis of AVN should
be questioned, as it is uncommon to present otherwise. Poste-
rior femoral head AVN can occasionally be found after poste-
rior dislocation of the hip because of impaction of the femoral
head on the posterior column of the acetabulum.

    A form of AVN that is smaller and more focal than that
just described is osteochondritis dissecans. It is most likely
caused by trauma; however, this is controversial, with one
school of thought believing the cause is idiopathic. It occurs
most often in the knee at the medial epicondyle (Fig. 43.50).
It also is frequently seen in the dome of the talus (Fig. 43.51)
