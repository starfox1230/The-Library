space, such as hemorrhage from aortic aneurysm rupture,
may extend into the perirenal space. Fluid collections in the
perirenal space are usually renal in origin (infection, urinoma,
hemorrhage). Bridging septa extending between the renal fas-
cia and the renal capsule tend to cause loculations of fluid
processes in the perirenal space. The right perirenal space is
open superiorly to the bare area of the liver, allowing spread
of disease processes (infection, tumor) between the kidney and
the liver.

    Gallstones and Gallbladder. Only about 15% of gallstones
contain sufficient calcium to be identified on conventional radi-
ography. Most calcified gallstones contain calcium bilirubinate
and have a laminated appearance with a dense outer rim and
more radiolucent center. When multiple gallstones are present,
they are commonly faceted. Calcifications in the gallbladder
wall (porcelain gallbladder) (Fig. 25.11) are plaque-like and
oval in configuration conforming to the size and shape of the
gallbladder. Milk of calcium bile is a suspension of radiopaque
crystals within gallbladder bile. Layering of the suspension can
be demonstrated on erect radiographs.

    Urinary Calculi. About 85% of urinary calculi are vis-
ible on conventional radiographs. They range in size from
punctate up to several centimeters. Most characteristic are
the staghorn calculi, which assume the shape of the renal
collecting system (Fig. 25.12). Renal calculi are differenti-
ated from gallstones on radiographs by oblique projections
that confirm their posterior position, as opposed to the more
anterior positions of gallstones. Ureteral calculi may be seen
anywhere along the course of the ureter but are most com-
mon at the areas of narrowing: the ureteropelvic junction, the

ment of the acute abdomen commonly includes the "acute
abdomen series," which consists of an erect posterior-anterior
chest radiograph and supine and erect or decubitus radiographs
of the abdomen. The chest radiograph provides optimal detec-

present with abdominal complaints. The supine abdominal film

horizontal-beam abdominal film adds confidence to the diag-
nosis. CT or US is routinely obtained to provide a definitive

that remains in the same general position on serial images (Fig.    Crohn colitis

cent inflammatory process. A sentinel loop in the right upper
quadrant suggests acute cholecystitis, hepatitis, or pyelone-
phritis. In the left upper quadrant, pancreatitis, pyelonephritis,
or splenic injury may be suspected. In the lower quadrants,
diverticulitis, appendicitis, salpingitis, cystitis, or Crohn dis-
ease is the cause of a sentinel loop.

    Toxic megacolon is a manifestation of fulminant colitis char-
acterized by extreme dilation of all or a portion of the colon.
In this state, peristalsis is absent and the large bowel loses all
tone and contractility. The patient has progressive abdominal
distension and is toxic, febrile, and obtunded. Bowel sounds
and bowel movements are absent. The bowel wall becomes like
"wet blotting paper," and the risk of perforation is extreme.
Mortality approaches 20% in toxic megacolon. Acute ulcer-
ative colitis is the most common cause of toxic megacolon
(Table 25.3). Conventional radiographs demonstrate disten-
sion of the colon with absent haustra. Dilation of the transverse
colon up to 15 cm diameter is often the most striking find-
ing. The diagnosis is suggested when the diameter of the colon
exceeds 5 cm and the mucosa appears abnormal (Fig. 25.20).
