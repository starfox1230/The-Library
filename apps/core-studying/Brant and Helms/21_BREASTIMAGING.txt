Spiculated Margins. Breast carcinoma classically appears

as a spiculated mass on mammography (Fig. 20.7); however,
less than 20% of nonpalpable cancers present as such (24).
Most spiculated-appearing breast cancers will be infiltrating
ductal carcinoma; however, tubular and lobular carcinomas
can present as such. Tubular carcinomas are more well-differ-
entiated histologically and carry a better prognosis. Lobular
carcinomas comprise about 10% of all invasive carcinomas.
They are not mammographically distinguishable from inva-
sive ductal carcinomas, although they are frequently more
subtle. Single rows of lobular cancer cells can infiltrate sur-
rounding tissues, so they generally cause less tissue distortion.

    A very limited differential exists for a spiculated mass.
    Fat necrosis from a previous surgical biopsy can appear
spiculated (Fig. 20.8).
    Scars from previous breast surgery should be carefully marked
with radiopaque wires. Comparison should be made with previ-
ous films, both to determine the location of the abnormality that
underwent biopsy and to assess for any increase in size of the
