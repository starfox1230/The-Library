than the crescent-shaped appearance that is characteristic on
axial CT scans. The multiplanar capability of MR scanning is
helpful in identifying small convexity and vertex hematomas
that might not be detected on axial CT scans because of the
similar attenuation of the adjacent bone.

    Subarachnoid hemorrhage is common in head injury but
is rarely large enough to cause a significant mass effect. It
results from the disruption of small subarachnoid vessels or
direct extension into the subarachnoid space by a contusion or
hematoma. On CT, subarachnoid hemorrhage appears as lin-
ear areas of high attenuation within the cisterns and sulci (Fig.
3.12). Subarachnoid collections along the convexity or tento-
rium can be differentiated from subdural hematomas by their
extension into adjacent sulci. Occasionally, the only finding
is apparent effacement of sulci when the sulci are filled with
small amounts of blood. In patients who are found uncon-
scious after an unwitnessed event, detection of subarachnoid
hemorrhage may indicate a ruptured aneurysm, rather than
trauma, as the primary cause. In such cases, contrast-enhanced
CT angiography and/or conventional catheter angiography
needs to be considered.

    Hyperacute subarachnoid hemorrhage may be more
difficult to detect on conventional MR than it is on CT scans
because it can be isointense to brain parenchyma on T1W and

shear strain and carries a grim prognosis.

    An extremely rare form of indirect primary brain stem injury
is the pontomedullary separation or rent. As the name implies,
this represents a tear in the ventral surface of the brain stem
at the junction of the pons and medulla. There is a spectrum
of severity ranging from a small tear to complete avulsion of
the brain stem. Pontomedullary separation can occur without
associated diffuse cerebral injury. This lesion is usually fatal.

    Secondary brain stem injury includes infarction, hemor-
rhage, or compression of the brain stem as a result of adjacent
or systemic pathology. Brain stem infarction from hypotension-
induced cerebral hypoperfusion is usually seen in conjunction
with supratentorial ischemic injury. The brain stem may be
relatively spared in hypoxic injury. Mechanical compression
of the brain stem usually occurs in the setting of uncal her-
niation. There may be visible displacement or a change in the
overall shape of the brain stem as a result of the mass effect.
Neurologic injury caused by brain stem compression may be
reversible in the absence of intrinsic brain stem lesions.

    Brain stem lesions that occur as a result of downward her-
niation, or hypoxia or ischemia, usually involve the ventral or
ventrolateral aspect of the brain stem, in contrast to primary
brain stem lesions, which are most common in the dorsolateral
