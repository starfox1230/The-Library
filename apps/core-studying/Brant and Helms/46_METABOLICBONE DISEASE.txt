             OSTEOMALACIA

Osteomalacia is the result of too much nonmineralized oste-
oid. The most common cause is renal osteodystrophy. The
radiographic findings are almost identical to those of osteopo-
rosis, and, for the most part, the two disorders are indistin-
guishable. The only finding that is pathognomonic for
osteomalacia is a Looser fracture, which is a fracture through
large osteoid seams (Fig. 44.9). They are extremely uncom-
mon but tend to occur in the femur, pelvis, and scapula.

    In children, osteomalacia is called rickets. It causes the
epiphyses to become flared and irregular and the long bones
to undergo bending from the bone softening (Fig. 44.10). As
in adults, the most common cause is renal disease, although
other causes such as biliary disease and dietary insufficiencies
are occasionally seen.

    The radiographic sign that is pathognomonic for HPT is
subperiosteal bone resorption. It is seen most commonly on
the radial aspect of the middle phalanges of the hand (Fig.
44.11), but it can be seen in any long bone in the body. It is
commonly seen on the medial aspect of the proximal tibia, at
the sacroiliac joints (Fig. 44.12), and in the distal clavicle.

    Other radiographic findings include osteosclerosis, usually
diffuse, but often involving the spine in a manner resembling
the stripes on rugby jerseys, hence, the name "rugger jersey
spine" (Fig. 44.13). Brown tumors are cystic lesions that are
often expansile and aggressive in appearance (Fig. 44.14).
They were once said to be more common in primary HPT
but are seen more commonly associated with secondary HPT
today because of the overwhelming preponderance of patients
with secondary disease compared with primary disease. A
brown tumor can have a variety of appearances, so the only
thing characteristic about it is that it is associated with sub-
periosteal bone resorption. If the underlying HPT is treated,
the subperiosteal resorption may disappear before the brown
tumor does. This is not commonly seen, however.

    The list of diseases that can cause diffuse osteosclerosis is
quite long, but a list that includes 95% to 98% of the patho-
logic processes is all that is really necessary. The entities I
include in the differential diagnosis of diffuse osteosclerosis
are listed in Table 44.2.

Like renal osteodystrophy, the underlying cause of dense bones
in sickle cell disease is unknown. It only occurs in a small per-
centage of patients. Additional signs to look for are bone
infarcts and step-off deformities of the vertebral body end-
plates (Fig. 44.18). These are also called "fish" vertebrae after
their appearance like the vertebrae found in fish. Avascular
necrosis of the hip is frequently an accompanying finding.

                     Myelofibrosis

Also called agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, myelofibrosis is a
disease caused by progressive fibrosis of the marrow in
patients older than 50 years of age. It leads to anemia with
marked splenomegaly and extramedullary hematopoiesis.
Whenever osteosclerosis is seen in a patient older than 50
years of age, a search should be made for a large spleen and
extramedullary hematopoiesis (Fig. 44.19).

                     Osteopetrosis

This is a hereditary abnormality that results in extremely
dense bones throughout the skeleton (Fig. 44.20). There are

characteristic finding is the so-called bone-in-bone appearance
often seen in the vertebral bodies in which the vertebrae have
a small replica of the vertebral body inside the normal one.
Also characteristic are the "sandwich vertebrae" in which the
endplates are densely sclerotic, giving the appearance of a
sandwich (Fig. 44.21). The sandwich vertebrae appearance
resembles a rugger jersey spine but can be differentiated by
being much denser and more sharply defined.

patients are typically short and have hypoplastic mandibles.
The distinguishing radiographic finding that is essentially
pathognomonic is acroosteolysis with sclerosis. The distal
phalanges often have the appearance of chalk that has been
put into a pencil sharpener: they are pointed and dense (Fig.
44.22). No other disease process has this appearance. Another
name for this disorder is Toulouse-Lautrec syndrome, named
for the famous artist who was afflicted with pyknodysostosis.
