20 mm and is located on the anterior endocardial surface of
the RA just above the SVC and right atrial appendage junc-
tion, near the crista terminalis. Electrical propagation spreads
to both atria via Purkinje-like fibers and is recorded as the P
wave on an electrocardiogram. The atrioventricular node is a
2 × 5 mm region of neuromuscular tissue on the endocardial
surface, along the right side of the interatrial septum, just infe-
rior to the ostium of the coronary sinus. The impulse is collected
and delayed approximately 0.7 seconds in the atrioventricular
node before passing into the bundle of His. The bundle of His
is a 20-mm-long tract which extends down the right side of the
membranous interventricular septum. The bundle of His bifur-
cates into a right and left bundle before arborizing through
the two ventricles via the Purkinje system. The interventricular
septum activates from superior to inferior, with the anterior or
septal RV being the first to activate and the posterior or basal
LV being the last to activate. This information is particularly
useful when evaluating phase analysis or phase propagation in
gated cardiac scintigraphy.

lower lobe vessels and increased caliber of upper lobe vessels.
Cephalization of blood flow is the earliest radiographic sign
of congestive heart failure and pulmonary venous hyperten-
sion. Cephalization begins at 10 to 13 mm Hg wedge pressure.
Equalization of upper to lower pulmonary blood flow occurs
at 14 to 16 mm Hg. Reversal of the normal distribution with
the upper lobe vessels distended and the lower lobe vessels
constricted occurs at 17 to 20 mm Hg. Hilar fullness, "Viking

commonly accompany reversed flow distribution.

    Pulmonary Edema. Interstitial edema with Kerley A, B,
and C lines and thickened pulmonary fissures occurs at 20 to
25 mm Hg wedge pressure (Fig. 21.19). Kerley lines represent
thickened interlobular septa: A lines are long straight lines radi-
ating toward the hila, B lines are horizontal lines connecting
to the pleural surface near the costophrenic angle, and C lines
are random reticular lines seen throughout the lungs. Alveolar
edema begins at 25 to 30 mm Hg wedge pressure (Fig. 21.20).
Chronic failure "toughens" the interstitium (often resulting
in hemosiderosis and pulmonary ossification) and can add an

tion of the LCA from the PA (Fig. 21.32). This is an excellent
area for evaluation by CTCA.

            Therapeutic Considerations

The primary modes of therapy for coronary artery disease
include many efficacious medical regimens, percutaneous cor-
onary angioplasty and stenting, and coronary artery bypass
graft surgery. Coronary artery bypass grafting usually uses
saphenous vein grafts or native internal mammary arteries.
Surgical bypass has been shown to prolong life in left main
coronary artery disease and three-vessel disease. Percutaneous
coronary angioplasty (see Fig. 22.5) is considered useful for
both single-vessel and multivessel disease and has an 85% to
90% initial success rate. Restenosis remains a significant prob-
lem in up to 50% of cases, typically occurring within the first
6 months. Restenosis is less frequent with newer stents.
Angioplasty is typically accomplished by balloon dilatation of
the stenotic lesion over a guidewire. Angioplasty is considered
successful when the stenosis is reduced to less than 50% of
diameter narrowing, although long-term prognosis is better
when there is less than a 30% residual stenosis. Directional
and rotational atherectomy and atherectomy with the translu-
minal extraction catheter and laser angioplasty are additional
percutaneous techniques that are currently used in specific
situations.

    The utility of coronary calcium screening lies in (1) early
detection of calcium in asymptomatic patients for risk strati-

atherosclerotic coronary disease, and (3) demonstration of the
absence of calcification, thereby essentially ruling out signifi-

ease, aortic and PA disease, pericardial disease, ventricular func-
tion, valvular function, cardiomyopathies, and cardiac masses.
Cardiac pacemakers are considered contraindications, but
most prosthetic valves can be safely studied.

    The best anatomic depiction is accomplished on spin-echo
T1WI in which the moving blood produces a signal void or
"black blood" appearance (Fig. 21.42). Gradient-echo or fast-
field echo images impart bright signal to coherently flowing
blood, creating a "white blood" appearance similar to con-
trast studies (Fig. 21.43). Electrocardiographic gating can be
used similarly as gated cardiac SPECT and gated cardiac blood
pool scintigraphy. Slice-specific information is acquired with
reference to specific phases within the cardiac cycle. With gra-
dient recalled echo technique, motion studies can show flow-
ing blood as well as myocardial contractility.

    Steady-state free precession (SSFP) cine imaging is another
excellent technique for visually assessing LV function. SSFP, in
contrast to older gradient-echo cine techniques, does not rely
on the inflow of unsaturated spins to create contrast between

mentary to echocardiography in straightforward CHD. The
exception is anomalous pulmonary venous return with the
often-associated sinus venosus ASD, where CMR is more
accurate than echocardiography because of its 3D coverage
of the chest. In addition to cine imaging demonstrating flow,
velocity-encoded imaging is useful for both sizing defects and
determining shunt ratios.

echocardiography. CMR has the advantage of its 3D coverage
