medullary and anaplastic carcinoma because of the lack of
iodine uptake by the tumor but can be imaged with F-18 FDG
PET/CT imaging.

    Radioiodine (I-131 or I-123) scans of the whole body,
neck, and chest are performed to determine the complete-
ness of surgery and to evaluate the response to treatment.
Uptake of I-131 or I-123 in the thyroid bed frequently rep-
resents residual thyroid tissue. Salivary, stomach, bowel, and
bladder activity represent physiologic traces of iodine distri-
bution. Focal activity in the lungs, skeleton, or in the neck
remote from the thyroid bed is pathologic. Nasal secretions
may contain radioiodine. A contaminated pocket handker-
chief should not be mistaken for a metastasis. Similarly, some
breast uptake may occur. This should not be confused with
lung metastasis. Unfortunately, some patients may have non-
iodine avid thyroid tumor but demonstrate persistent disease
as noted by the elevated serum thyroglobulin. Tl-201 (34,35).
Tc-99m-Sestamibi (36) and Tc-99m-tetrofosmin (37) have
shown some utility in imaging non-I-131-avid thyroid tumor.
F-18 FDG PET/CT imaging has demonstrated its utility in
imaging noniodine-avid recurrence with a sensitivity of 60%
and a specificity of 60% to 80% (38,39). Hürthle cell has
similarities to follicular cell, since Hürthle cell is well differ-
entiated, but unlike follicular, Hürthle cell is less iodine avid
than follicular. Hürthle cell typically follows an aggressive
course with a higher mortality compared with the other dif-
ferentiated thyroid cancers. A recent study demonstrated a
95% sensitivity with F18 FDG in detecting remnant or meta-
static Hurtle cells (40).
