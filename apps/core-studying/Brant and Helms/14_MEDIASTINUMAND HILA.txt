tion of sarcoidosis from lymphoma and metastatic disease. In
sarcoidosis, the enlarged nodes produce a lobulated appear-
ance on chest radiographs and CT, because the enlarged nodes
do not coalesce. This is in contrast to lymphoma and nodal
metastases, in which the intranodal tumor extends through the
nodal capsule to form conglomerate enlarged nodal masses.
Right and left paratracheal lymph nodes are typically involved;
anterior or posterior mediastinal nodal enlargement has been
described with greater frequency recently, probably as a result
of the improved sensitivity of CT for detecting nodal involve-
ment in these regions.

    A variety of infections, most commonly histoplasmosis, coc-
cidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, and tuberculosis, can cause
mediastinal nodal enlargement (Fig. 13.15). Typically these
patients have parenchymal opacities on chest radiographs,
but isolated lymph node enlargement may be seen, particu-
larly in children and young adults. Bacterial infections such as
anthrax, bubonic plague, and tularemia are uncommon causes
of lymph node enlargement. Typically, there will be symptoms
and signs of acute infection, and chest radiographs will show
evidence of pneumonia. Bacterial lung abscesses also may be
associated with reactive lymph node enlargement. Hilar and
mediastinal lymph nodes may be enlarged in patients with
measles pneumonia and infectious mononucleosis.

    Esophageal varices may produce a round or lobulated ret-
rocardiac mass in patients with portal hypertension. The diag-
nosis is usually made by endoscopic recognition of submucosal
varices involving the distal esophagus. The varices are readily
recognized on contrast CT, MR, or portal venography.

    A common cause of a mass in the posteroinferior medi-
astinum is a hiatal hernia. This results from a separation of
the superior margins of the diaphragmatic crura and stretch-
ing of the phrenicoesophageal ligament. The stomach is by
far the most common structure in the hernia sac (Fig. 13.21);
the gastric cardia (sliding hernia) or fundus (paraesophageal
hernia) may be involved. Rarely, omental fat, ascitic fluid, or
a pancreatic pseudocyst herniates through the esophageal hia-
tus into the mediastinum. The characteristic location at the
esophageal hiatus and the presence of a rounded density con-
taining an air or air-fluid level on upright films are diagnostic.
Barium swallow or a CT scan will confirm the diagnosis (see
Fig. 19.25).

mately two-thirds of patients with meningoceles have neu-

well-defined paraspinal mass that is indistinguishable from a
neurofibroma. Additional clues to the diagnosis include rib
erosion, enlargement of the adjacent neural foramen, verte-
bral anomalies, or kyphoscoliosis. When a lateral meningo-
cele is associated with kyphoscoliosis, it is usually found at
the apex of the scoliotic curve on the convex side. MR dem-

technique of choice (Fig. 13.23); conventional or CT myel-

cular interstitium produces interstitial opacities that mimic pul-
monary edema. Serial radiographs may show rapid changes in
mediastinal or pleural fluid collections in patients with persis-
tent hemorrhage. CT demonstrates abnormal soft tissue within
the mediastinum that obliterates the normal interfaces between
the mediastinal fat, the vessels, and the airways (Fig. 13.28).
Freshly clotted blood is high in attenuation and is usually
easily appreciated on helical CT. CT is also superior to plain
radiography in demonstrating the extramediastinal extent of
hemorrhage and is useful in demonstrating associated thoracic
injuries in patients following blunt chest trauma.

    Mediastinal lipomatosis is a benign, asymptomatic con-
dition characterized by excessive deposition of fat in the
mediastinum. Predisposing conditions include obesity, Cush-
ing disease, and corticosteroid therapy. However, this entity
is unassociated with identifiable conditions in approximately
50% of patients.

    On conventional radiographs, the most common finding is
smooth, symmetric widening of the superior mediastinum. If
the amount of fat deposition is marked, the mediastinum may
