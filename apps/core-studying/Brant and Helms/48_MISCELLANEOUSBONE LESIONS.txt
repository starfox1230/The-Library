itary disorder that seems to affect multiple members of a family
with multiple osteochondromas or exostoses. An osteochon-
droma is a cartilage-capped bone outgrowth that may be pedun-
culated or sessile in appearance. In the multiple hereditary form,
the knees are virtually always involved (Fig. 46.10). Under-
tubulation (a widened diameter of the bone) is invariably present
at the site of the exostosis. The incidence of malignant degenera-
tion in this population has been reported to be as high as 20%,
but this is a gross overestimation, with malignant degeneration
being extremely rare. As with solitary osteochondromas, the
more axially situated lesions are more prone to undergo malig-
nant degeneration, whereas the more peripheral lesions are less
likely to do so. The proximal femurs are frequently involved and
have a characteristic appearance (Fig. 46.11).

in virtually every case of multiple hereditary exostosis. They typically

    The nidus itself is usually lucent but often develops some
calcification within it. It then has the appearance of a seques-
trum, as is seen in osteomyelitis. If the nidus calcifies com-
pletely, it blends in with the surrounding sclerosis and cannot
be seen on most radiographs. Therefore, the diagnosis of an
osteoid osteoma in no way depends on seeing a nidus.

    Because an osteoid osteoma resembles osteomyelitis, regard-
less of the appearance of the nidus, it can be difficult to dif-
ferentiate the two radiographically. It cannot be reliably done
with plain films, CT, or MR. However, because the nidus is
extremely vascular, it avidly accumulates radiopharmaceutical
bone-scanning agents. An osteoid osteoma will have an area of

        OSTEOPATHIA STRIATA

Also known as Voorhoeve disease, this disorder is manifested
by multiple 2- to 3-mm-thick linear bands of sclerotic bone
aligned parallel to the long axis of a bone (Fig. 46.14). It usu-
ally affects multiple long bones and is asymptomatic; hence, it
is usually an incidental finding.

Osteopoikilosis is a hereditary, asymptomatic disorder that is
usually an incidental finding of multiple small (3 to 10 mm) scle-
rotic bony densities affecting primarily the ends of long bones
and the pelvis (Fig. 46.15). It has no clinical significance other
than that it can be confused for diffuse osteoblastic metastases.

clubbing of the fingers, and widespread periostitis. It seems
to be more common in black patients. The periosteal reac-
tion is similar to that of hypertrophic pulmonary osteoar-
thropathy, but pachydermoperiostosis is only occasionally
painful.
