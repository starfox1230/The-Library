proliferates within the airspaces. This fibroblastic tissue may
resolve and leave minimal scarring or, particularly in those
with severe disease and long-standing oxygen requirements,
result in extensive interstitial fibrosis.

    Radiographically, ARDS follows a predictable pattern.
Chest radiographs become abnormal by 12 to 24 hours fol-
lowing the onset of dyspnea and demonstrate patchy periph-
eral airspace opacities (Fig. 14.3) (2). CT scans show diffuse
ground-glass and airspace opacities which may have a striking
nondependent distribution. Interlobular septal thickening is
usually absent (Fig. 14.4). These opacities coalesce over the
next several days to produce confluent bilateral airspace opac-
ities with air bronchograms. Radiographic improvement in the
opacities may be seen within the first week, but this is often
caused by the effects of increasing positive pressure ventilation
rather than true histologic improvement. After 1 week, the air-
space opacities gradually give way to a coarse reticulonodular
pattern that may resolve over the course of several months or
remain unchanged, in which case the pattern represents irre-
versible pulmonary fibrosis (i.e., honeycombing). Pneumonia
complicating ARDS is difficult to diagnose radiographically,
but it should be suspected when a focal area of airspace opaci-
fication or a significant pleural effusion develops during the

    High-altitude pulmonary edema develops in certain indi-
viduals after rapid ascent to altitudes above 3500 m. Edema
typically develops within 48 to 72 hours of ascent and appears
to reflect a varied individual response to hypoxemia, in which
scattered areas of pulmonary arterial spasm result in tran-
sient pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This produces
an increase in high-pressure blood flow to uninvolved areas,
resulting in damage to the capillary endothelium and increased
permeability edema, typically with a patchy distribution. Res-
olution usually occurs within 24 to 48 hours after the adminis-
tration of supplemental oxygen or a return to sea level.

impedance to pulmonary venous return to the left heart can
produce venous hypertension. Less common entities in this
group include atrial myxoma, cor triatriatum, and pulmonary
vein stenosis or occlusion. Chronic LV failure rarely, if ever,
results in PAH owing to relatively short chronicity. An impor-
tant clue to the presence of mitral stenosis is enlargement of the
LA and appendage. Unfortunately, the pulmonary trunk may
be enlarged in patients with LV failure from ischemic heart
disease owing to the presence of concomitant emphysema.

    Parenchymal lung diseases, particularly centrilobular
emphysema and diffuse interstitial fibrosis, are common
causes of PAH. The mechanisms by which these disorders pro-
duce increased vascular resistance include chronic hypoxemia
and reflex vasoconstriction and the development of irrevers-
ible changes in pulmonary arteriolar caliber, with widespread
obliteration of the pulmonary vascular bed. The radiographic
findings of emphysema and interstitial fibrosis are usually
evident on plain radiographs by the time PAH has developed
(Fig. 14.15).

    Chronic hypoxemia from alveolar hypoventilation is the
likely mechanism for PAH that complicates pleural fibrosis,
kyphoscoliosis, and the obesity-hypoventilation syndrome.
Pleural thickening and kyphoscoliosis are readily evident
radiographically. The obesity-hypoventilation (obstructive
sleep apnea) syndrome is usually associated with marked trun-
cal obesity and lungs that are diminished in volume (mostly

     monary artery shows dilated main and left pulmonary arteries, with thrombosis of the truncus anterior branch of the right
     pulmonary artery (arrow). B. At the level of the hila, there is an eccentric filling defect (arrow) in the right interlobar artery
     and a weblike filling defect (arrowhead) containing calcification in the left interlobar artery. These findings are characteris-
     tic of chronic unresolved emboli.
