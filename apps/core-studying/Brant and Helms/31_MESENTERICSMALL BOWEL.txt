Hemorrhage usually causes thicker folds than edema and may
result in scalloping or "thumbprinting" of some folds.

(25). This is the most difficult category of abnormality, because
many conditions are unusual. The distribution of fold abnor-
mality helps to limit the differential diagnosis (Fig. 30.18).

    Some conditions are included in several categories. Early
Crohn disease is characterized by edema and regular folds.
More advanced Crohn disease has inflammatory cell infiltrate
and irregular folds. Lymphoma in the mesentery obstructs lym-
phatics and causes edema, and lymphoma in the bowel wall
causes nodular, irregular folds. Lymphoma and Crohn disease
are the two most commonly encountered small bowel diseases.

    Scleroderma produces atrophy of the muscularis of the
small bowel by the process of progressive collagen deposi-
tion resulting in flaccid, atonic, and dilated bowel (7). The
valvulae conniventes are normal or thinned (Fig. 30.19). A
"hide-bound" appearance of thinned folds tethered together is
produced by the contraction of the longitudinal muscle layer

to a greater extent than the circular muscle layer. Excessive
contraction of the mesenteric border of the small bowel results
in the formation of mucosal sacculations along the antimes-
enteric border. The jejunum and duodenum are more severely
involved than the ileum. The diagnosis is confirmed by skin
changes and characteristic involvement of the esophagus. Mal-
absorption eventually occurs.

    Adult celiac disease (nontropical sprue) presents with malab-
sorption, steatorrhea, and weight loss. Gluten, an insoluble pro-
tein found in wheat, rye, oats, and barley, acts as a toxic agent
to the small bowel mucosa. The mucosa becomes flattened and
absorptive cells decrease in number; villi disappear. The sub-
mucosa, muscularis, and serosa remain normal. Findings and
symptoms resolve with a strict gluten-free diet. Complication of

    Behet disease is a multisystem disease due to a small vessel
vasculitis that affects eyes, joints, skin, CNS, and the intestinal
tract. Prominent clinical features include relapsing iridocyclitis,
mucocutaneous ulcerations, vesicles, pustules, and mild arthri-
tis. Intestinal disease most commonly involves the ileocecal
region, where Crohn disease is closely mimicked with aphthous
erosions, deep ulceration, stenosis, and fistula formation. Com-
plications include bowel perforation and peritonitis.
