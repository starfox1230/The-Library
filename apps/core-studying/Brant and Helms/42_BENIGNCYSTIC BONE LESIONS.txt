Christian disease. Although these forms may be merely differ-
ent phases of the same disease, most investigators categorize
them separately. The bony manifestations of all three disor-
ders are similar and are discussed in this review simply as EG.

    Eosinophilic granuloma, unfortunately for radiologists,
has many appearances (2). It can be lytic or sclerotic; it may
be well defined or ill defined; it might or might not have a
sclerotic border; and it might or might not elicit a periosteal
response. The periostitis, when present, is typically benign
in appearance (thick, uniform, wavy) but can be lamellated
or amorphous. Eosinophilic granuloma can mimic Ewing
sarcoma and present as a permeative (multiple small holes)
lesion.

    How, then, can one distinguish EG from any of the other
lytic lesions in this differential? Remember that it is difficult to
exclude EG from almost any differential of a bony lesion, be
it benign or malignant. Eosinophilic granuloma occurs almost
exclusively in patients less than the age of 30 years (usually <20
years); therefore, the patient's age is the best criterion. I recom-
mend mentioning EG as a differential possibility for any lesion
in a patient less than the age of 30. Because EG can look like
anything, so long as the radiograph is not of an arthritide or
trauma, EG can be mentioned without even looking at the film!

    Eosinophilic granuloma is most often monostotic (Fig.
40.12), but it can be polyostotic (Fig. 40.13) and, thus, has to

patient older than the age of 40 should have metastatic disease
as a consideration, unless trauma or arthritis is the primary
concern.

    For statistical purposes, I do not mention metastatic disease in
a patient younger than the age of 40. I will be correct more than
99% of the time using 40 as a cut-off age. Otherwise, metastatic
diseases would have to be mentioned in every single case of a lytic
lesion, and I prefer to limit the list of differential possibilities. I
am not claiming that metastatic disease does not occur in patients
younger than the age of 40, only that I consider it acceptable to
miss it (unless given a history of a known primary neoplasm).

    Although myeloma most commonly presents as a diffuse
permeative process in the skeleton (Fig. 40.26), it can present
as either a solitary lesion (Fig. 40.27) or multiple lytic lesions.
Bubbly, lytic bone lesions of myeloma are more correctly called
plasmacytomas. I mention plasmacytoma separately from
metastatic disease because it can occur in a slightly younger
population (age greater than 35 years is my cut-off) and can
precede clinical or hematologic evidence of myeloma by 3 to
5 years. In general, there is no harm in lumping all metastatic
disease, including myeloma, into one group and using greater
than age 40 as the limiting factor.

    Virtually any metastatic process can present as a lytic,
benign-appearing lesion; therefore, it serves no purpose to try
to guess the source of the metastatic disease from its appear-
ance. In general, lytic expansile metastatic diseases tend to come

automatically mention them regardless of the location or
appearance of the lesion. Infection and EG must be mentioned
for those younger than the age of 30 years, whereas metastatic
disease and infection must be included in any differential in
a patient older than the age of 40 years (Table 40.3). These
lesions have a protean radiographic appearance and should be
mentioned not only in the benign, cystic differential, but also
for an aggressive lesion.

    If periostitis or pain is present (assuming no trauma, which
can be a foolhardy assumption), you can exclude fibrous dys-
plasia, solitary bone cyst, NOF, and enchondroma (Table
40.4). If the lesion is epiphyseal, the differential is infection,
giant cell tumor, chondroblastoma (and do not forget geodes)
(Table 40.5). If the patient is more than 40 years of age, add
metastatic disease and myeloma and remove chondroblastoma
from the epiphyseal list.

    The epiphyseal differential tends to apply also to the tar-    FIGURE 40.42. Healing Nonossifying Fibroma. A plain film of the

also be considered and has a characteristic appearance and
location (see Fig. 40.35). Apophyses are "epiphyseal equiva-
lents" and have the same differential as epiphyses. The differ-
ence between an epiphysis and an apophysis is that epiphyses
contribute to the length of a bone, whereas apophyses serve as
ligamentous attachments.

    A classic differential for benign, cystic rib lesions is the
mnemonic FAME, in which F  fibrous dysplasia, A  ABC,

    If there are multiple lytic lesions present, FEEMHI is a use-
ful mnemonic of the lesions in FEGNOMASHIC, which can
be multiple. F  fibrous dysplasia, E  enchondroma, E 
EG, M  metastatic disease and myeloma, H  hyperparathy-
roidism (brown tumor), and I  infection (Table 40.7).

    A few findings that just do not seem to narrow the differ-
ential diagnosis are presence or absence of a soft tissue mass,
expansion of the bone (except it must be present in an ABC),
a sclerotic or nonsclerotic border (except it must be nonscle-
rotic in giant cell tumor), presence or absence of bony struts or
compartments in the lesion, and size of the lesion.

    If calcified matrix is identified in a lesion, it is tempting
to narrow the differential to either the osteoid series or the
chondroid series of lesions, depending on the character of the
matrix. Be careful of this. Very few radiologists can reliably
differentiate chondroid from osteoid matrix. Routine calcifica-
tion of a lesion or debris, detritus, or sequestrations in osteo-
myelitis can mimic chondroid or osteoid calcification and be
misleading. The only lesion that must exhibit calcified matrix
is the enchondroma (except in the phalanges). Chondroblas-
tomas and osteoblastomas demonstrate calcified matrix about
half the time, and chondromyxoid fibromas never have radio-
graphically demonstrable calcified matrix.
