    The earliest demonstration of the embryo is the double bleb
sign, produced by the amniotic sac and the yolk sac with the
embryonic disc between them (Fig. 37.4). Embryos as small as
2 mm can be detected by transvaginal US. The earliest embry-
onic cardiac activity can be detected by careful inspection of
the embryonic disc by real-time US. Transvaginal sonography
may demonstrate tiny normal embryos (<5 mm) in which
cardiac activity cannot be confirmed. Cardiac activity should
always be seen transvaginally in embryos that can be visual-
ized by transabdominal US.

    The corpus luteum develops on the ovary at the site of the
dominant follicle from which ovulation occurred. The corpus
luteum secretes estrogens, progesterone, and other hormones
that are essential for establishing and maintaining pregnancy.
The wide range of normal appearance of the corpus luteum on
US must be recognized for accurate diagnoses of abnormalities
of the first trimester (Fig. 37.5) (10). Immediately following
ovulation, the corpus luteum appears as an area of focal hem-
orrhage on the ovary. It soon develops into a cystic structure
averaging 2 to 5 cm in size and containing clear fluid or fluid
with floating internal echoes or clots of hemorrhage. Color

rhagic corpus luteal cyst (between arrowheads) may enlarge to become a prominent pelvic structure and be a source of adnexal pain in early

an embryo.

until the third trimester, GA is assigned on the basis of BPD,
HC, and FL measurements, recognizing the imprecision of GA
estimations in the third trimester. EFW is determined from
established charts with those based on three or four biometric
measurements being the most accurate (20). The error range
of these weight predictions is large, as high as 18% depending
on the chart used. IUGR is diagnosed confidently when the
EFW is below the 5th percentile for GA and is excluded when
the EFW is above the 20th percentile for GA. When the EFW
is between the 5th and 20th percentile, IUGR is diagnosed
if oligohydramnios or maternal hypertension is present, and
it is likely not present if the amniotic fluid volume is normal
or elevated and the mother is normotensive. US follow-up of
fetuses with IUGR should be performed weekly or biweekly
and include measurement of growth parameters, assessment of
amniotic fluid volume, biophysical profile score, and umbilical

cystadenoma, hydrosalpinx, and paraovarian cyst (24).

    Theca lutein cysts form due to an exaggerated corpus
luteum response to high levels of -hCG. They appear as bilat-
eral multicystic enlargement of the ovaries. They occur with
gestational trophoblastic disease, pregnancy with more than
one fetus, or associated with the use of ovulation-inducing
drugs (24) (Fig. 37.14).

    Cervical incompetence may be congenital or may result
from cervical lacerations, excessive cervical dilation, or thera-
peutic abortion. The incompetent cervix is incapable of retain-
ing a pregnancy to term. Preterm delivery is the single most
common cause of a poor neonatal outcome. An obstetric his-
tory of recurrent spontaneous loss of pregnancy in the sec-
ond trimester establishes the diagnosis. US is used to measure
and follow cervical length and appearance. Scans are best
performed transvaginally or translabially from the introitus
with the bladder empty. A full urinary bladder compresses the
lower uterus and falsely elongates the length of the cervix. The
normal cervical length is 26 to 50 mm throughout gestation.
Cervical length is measured in sagittal plane between the
internal os marked by a V-shaped notch and the external os
marked by a triangular echodensity (Fig. 37.20). The endo-
cervical canal is seen as a thin hypoechoic or hyperechoic
line. The relative risk of preterm delivery increases as cervical
length decreases, with the greatest risk for cervical lengths of
less than 2.5 cm. Cervical dilation is measured between the
anterior and posterior surface of the cervical canal. Dilation
of the cervical canal greater than 8 mm is indicative of cervical
incompetence. Membranes may be seen bulging into the cer-
vical canal. Sutures associated with cervical cerclage used to
treat cervical incompetence are seen on US as echogenic linear
structures with acoustic shadowing.

             Placenta and Membranes

separation into the third trimester is believed to be of no clini-
cal significance.

    Amniotic band syndrome is caused by the early (gener-
ally before 10 weeks GA) disruption of the amnion, enabling
the fetus to enter the chorionic cavity (Fig. 37.25). The fetus
becomes entangled in fibrous bands that develop within the
chorionic cavity. Entrapment of fetal parts results in amputa-
tion deformities that range from mild to incompatible with
life. Typical abnormalities include asymmetrical absence of
the cranium resembling anencephaly, encephaloceles, gastros-
chisis and truncal defects, spinal deformities, and extremity
amputations. The amniotic bands trapping the fetus may be
visualized.

    Uterine synechiae (amniotic sheets) are membranous struc-
tures that project into the uterine cavity. They demonstrate
a characteristic appearance with a bulbous-free edge, thinner
midportion, and a thickened base (Fig. 37.26). The fetus is
able to move freely about the sheet of tissue. No fetal deformi-
ties are associated with this condition, which makes it distinct

fetal transfusion, is highly successful. Nonimmune hydrops
is caused by a host of conditions including cardiac disorders,
infections, chromosomal anomalies, twin pregnancy, urinary
obstruction, and umbilical cord complications. The cause of
many cases is not identified. The prognosis for nonimmune
hydrops remains poor.

Mortality is high (70%) because of pulmonary hypoplasia.

    Cystic adenomatoid malformation is a congenital hamar-
tomatous lesion of the lung, usually affecting one lobe (38).
The lesion consists of single or multiple cysts that vary in
size from microscopic to larger than 2 cm size. Type I lesions
appear on US as single or multiple cysts larger than 2 cm size.
Type II lesions consist of multiple smaller cysts of uniform
size less than 2 cm. Type III lesions appear as echogenic solid
masses because the cysts are microscopic (Fig. 37.41). Mixed
forms are common and classification does not determine prog-
nosis. Polyhydramnios and fetal hydrops may occur. Some of
these lesions resolve spontaneously in utero.
