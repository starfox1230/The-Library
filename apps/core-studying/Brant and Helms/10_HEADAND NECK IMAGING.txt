mal isotope uptake is also noted in a subcentimeter right parotid lymph node (arrow). This node could easily be overlooked prospectively during
interpretation of the MR. As expected, histology of the nasopharyngeal mass reflected a squamous cell carcinoma, the most common malignancy
arising from the head and neck mucosal surfaces. The right parotid lymph node also proved to reflect metastatic disease. (C and D) Enlarged
bilateral retropharyngeal nodes are evident on MR (arrowheads), with corresponding abnormal isotope uptake on CT-PET. This case demon-
strates the value of staging head and neck malignancies with CT-PET, as well as the increased specificity of combining functional/physiologic

skull base. This tough fascia separates the mucosal space from
the surrounding parapharyngeal space. Lesions originating
within the superficial mucosal space may invade deep to the
mucosal surface, resulting first in lateral displacement and
then obliteration of the parapharyngeal space. However, many
early lesions that begin within the mucosal space present as
only mild mucosal irregularities or asymmetries (Fig. 9.7).
This space is easily evaluated by the clinician and thus the
radiologist should have a low threshold for suggesting the
presence of abnormalities within this space. In children, there
is frequently prominent adenoidal tissue that fills the nasophar-
ynx. Even in adults, following a recent upper respiratory infec-
tion, prominent symmetrical mucosal tissue may be noted; this
is of little concern as long as there is no invasion of deep facial
places and no associated adenopathy (Fig. 9.8).

    Benign Lesions. The most common benign lesions arising
in the mucosal space are Tornwaldt cysts and lesions related to
minor salivary gland tissue. Tornwaldt cysts are sharply mar-
ginated and are found in the midline with high signal inten-
sity on T2WIs (Fig. 9.9). They are believed to be remnants

ally, pseudotumors of the masticator space are common and
include accessory parotid glands as well as marked muscle
hypertrophy resulting from bruxism. Occasionally, an acces-
sory parotid gland may occur along the anterior surface of
the masseter muscle and can be mistaken for a mass. Asym-
metry of the muscles of mastication may result from unilateral
atrophy, owing to compromise of the mandibular division of
the fifth cranial nerve (V3). This is most commonly seen in
patients with head and neck neoplasms with perineural exten-
sion along the trigeminal nerve.

    Primary malignancies of the masticator space are very
uncommon. Malignancies of this space most often result from
the extension of oropharyngeal or tongue base squamous cell
carcinoma to involve the muscles of mastication. In addition,
tumor or infection from oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal
lesions may spread along the third division of the fifth cra-
nial nerve, allowing the tumor to ascend through the foramen
ovale into the cavernous sinus (Fig. 9.18). From this location, a
tumor may extend posteriorly along the cisternal portion of the
trigeminal nerve to the brainstem. Primary malignancies of the

form a cone with its base at the posterior of the globe and
its apex at the superior orbital fissure. When identifying an
intraconal lesion, an essential issue is whether the lesion arises
from the optic nerve sheath complex or is extrinsic to it. The
optic nerve sheath complex is composed of the optic nerve and
the surrounding perioptic nerve sheath. The optic nerve is an
extension of the brain enveloped by CSF and leptomeninges,
which form the optic nerve sheath. Therefore, the CSF space
that envelops the optic nerve is continuous with the intracra-
nial subarachnoid space. If a lesion arises from the optic nerve
sheath complex, the most common lesion is either an optic
nerve glioma or optic sheath meningioma.

    Optic nerve glioma is the most common tumor of the optic
nerve and typically occurs during the first decade of life (Fig.
9.24). There is a high association with neurofibromatosis type
1, particularly when there is bilateral optic nerve involvement.
Histologically, these lesions are low-grade pilocytic astrocy-
tomas. The characteristic imaging finding is that of enlarge-
ment of the optic nerve sheath complex. The enlarged sheath
complex may be tubular, fusiform, or eccentric with kinking.
Some optic nerve gliomas have extensive associated thicken-
ing of the perioptic meninges. Histologically, this reflects per-
itumoral-reactive meningeal change, which has been termed
"arachnoidal hyperplasia" or "gliomatosis." This finding is
often seen in patients with neurofibromatosis.

    Optic sheath meningiomas arise from hemangioendothe-
lial cells of the arachnoid layer of the optic nerve sheath. These
