    The normal supraspinatus tendon is said to be uniformly
low in signal on all pulse sequences. Unfortunately, this is not
always the case. In fact, it often has some intermediate-to-high
signal in the tendon, which causes much confusion. If the sig-

                SYNDROME

The oblique sagittal T1WIs are useful to look for fatty atro-
phy in any of the cuff muscles. If the infraspinatus is smaller
than the other muscles and/or has fatty infiltration, the afore-
mentioned suprascapular nerve entrapment secondary to a
ganglion in the spinoglenoid notch is the likely diagnosis. If
the teres minor has fatty atrophy (Fig. 48.17), the diagnosis is
quadrilateral space syndrome. This most commonly occurs
from fibrous bands or scar tissue in the quadrilateral space
impinging on the axillary nerve. The quadrilateral space lies
between the teres minor superiorly, the teres major inferiorly,
the long head of the triceps medially, and the diaphysis of the
humerus laterally. The axillary nerve traverses the quadrilat-
eral space and innervates the teres minor and deltoid muscles;
however, the deltoid is rarely involved in quadrilateral space
syndrome. Quadrilateral space syndrome is found in about
1% of shoulder MRIs. These patients present clinically similar
to a rotator cuff tear, and many patients have had needless
surgery for presumed cuff pathology when the real problem
was quadrilateral space syndrome. Generally no surgery is
necessary as physical therapy is usually successful in breaking
up the fibrous bands or scar tissues that cause this entity.
