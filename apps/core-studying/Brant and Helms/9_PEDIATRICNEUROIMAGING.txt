sutures expand under pressure. Unlike hydranencephaly (in which the brain substance is entirely absent,) in

trans-spatial lesion of the neck, with extension from the retrocarotid space, through the parapharyngeal space to fill the
floor of mouth (arrows). The relatively homogenous solid appearance of this lesion combined with minimal T2-hyperintensity,
distinguish these lesions from other trans-spatial lesions such as the cystic appearing and T2-hyperintense hemangiomas
and lymphangiomas.

     (B) reveal numerous cranial nerve and spinal cord tumors. The vestibular or "acoustic" schwannomas (white arrows) are
     often bilateral in NF-2, and are a hallmark of this disorder. Numerous additional cranial nerve schwannomas are often
     present and must be carefully looked for, as this will help confirm the diagnosis of NF-2. Fifth cranial nerve schwannomas
     expand the cavernous sinuses (open arrows in A). Intramedullary glial cord tumors (white arrowheads in B) are frequent,
     but may be slow growing and asymptomatic.

     identified in more than half of patients. The schwannomas are most common, and arise from the dorsal nerve roots. The
