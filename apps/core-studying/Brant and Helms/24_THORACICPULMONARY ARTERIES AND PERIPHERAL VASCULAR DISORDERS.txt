for aneurysms 5 to 5.9 cm, but increased sharply to 7% per
year for aneurysms 6.0 cm or larger. Rupture and acute dissec-
tion are the major complications of thoracic aortic aneurysms
and can be fatal. Endovascular therapy using stent grafts has
successfully been undertaken for descending thoracic aneu-
rysms, and at least three devices are currently FDA approved
for this indication (Fig. 23.6D). As with thoracic aortic injury,
difficulties with device size and placement continue to be
problematic, but significant advances have been and will con-
tinue to be made.

    Vasculitis is defined as an inflammatory process of the
aorta and/or great vessels. There are a relatively large number
of vasculitides, but only Takayasu arteritis and infection occur
with enough frequency to deserve mention.

    Although not that common in the United States, Takayasu
arteritis presents a striking angiographic picture (Fig. 23.7).
It represents a granulomatous (giant cell) inflammation of
the media and adventitia of large elastic arteries. It frequently
occurs in Asian women with a female to male ratio 10:1
and most often affects the thoracic aorta and its proximal
branches, the abdominal aorta, and the PAs. There are two rel-

quite bizarre in nature. Atherosclerotic aneurysms most often
occur in the iliac and femoral arteries of the pelvis, the pop-
liteal artery of the lower limb, and the subclavian artery of
the upper extremity. An internal iliac artery aneurysm occurs
when the vessel is greater than 2 cm in diameter. Most are
asymptomatic; however the major risk is rupture. They are
most often associated with abdominal aortic aneurysms. Inter-
nal iliac artery aneurysms can be effectively treated endovascu-
larly by coiling. Complications of coiling to be considered are
buttock pain (claudication) and impotence in the male which
are best avoided if the contralateral internal iliac artery is pat-
ent to supply collateral flow.

    The exact etiology of popliteal artery aneurysms is
unknown; however arteriosclerosis seems to be the dominant
associated factor. Approximately one-third of patients are
asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Symptomatic patients
present with distal embolization or aneurysmal thrombosis
causing claudication or critical limb ischemia. In addition, the
