Wirsung (DW, black arrows) and the accessory duct of Santorini (DS, open arrow). In this patient, the main duct drained separately into the
major papilla (of Vater) with a different orifice for the common bile duct. The accessory duct drained into the minor papilla. Both ampullae were
cannulated endoscopically and injected before this radiograph. A number of different variants of pancreatic duct anatomy exist. This variant is
found in about 35% of individuals. Embryologically, the main duct is formed by the entire duct of the ventral pancreatic bud and the distal por-
tion of the duct of the dorsal pancreatic bud. The main duct may join the common bile duct or have a separate orifice in the major papilla. The
proximal portion of the duct of the dorsal pancreatic bud may be obliterated or persist as the accessory duct. E, endoscope. B. Image from an MR

may be nonfunctional and grow to large size before present-

(17). Gastrinomas present with peptic ulcers, diarrhea caused
by gastric hypersecretion, or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Other
islet cell tumors include glucagonoma (diabetes mellitus and
painful glossitis), somatostatinoma (diabetes and steatorrhea),
and VIPoma (massive watery diarrhea). Functioning tumors
vary in malignant potential from 10% for insulinoma to 60%
for gastrinoma and to 80% for glucagonoma. Functioning islet
cell tumors are usually less than 3 cm in size and require strict
attention to technique for accurate preoperative identification.

    Splenic Regeneration. After splenectomy, remaining acces-
sory spleens or splenules resulting from traumatic peritoneal
seeding of splenic tissue, may enlarge and resume the func-
tion of the resected spleen. When the spleen is removed, bits
of nuclear material, called Howell-Jolly bodies, are routinely
seen in red cells on peripheral blood smears. Normal splenic
tissue routinely clears red blood cells containing Howell-Jolly
bodies from the peripheral blood. Disappearance of these
Howell-Jolly bodies from peripheral blood is a clinical sign
of splenic regeneration. Imaging studies demonstrate single or
multiple spleen-like masses (Fig. 27.23) in the abdominal cav-
ity in patients with a history of splenectomy.

    Polysplenia is a rare congenital anomaly that features mul-
tiple small spleens, usually located in the right abdomen and
associated with situs ambiguous. Both lungs are two-lobed.
Most patients also have cardiovascular anomalies.

CT is only 65% sensitive in demonstrating splenic involve-
ment with lymphoma. Patterns of involvement visible on
imaging studies include diffuse splenomegaly, multiple masses
of varying size, miliary nodules resembling microabscesses,
large solitary mass (Fig. 27.25), and direct invasion from adja-
cent lymphomatous nodes. Adenopathy is frequently evident
elsewhere in the abdomen when the spleen is involved with
lymphoma. Lymphoma is a common predisposing condition
for splenic infarction.

    Metastases are found in the spleen on autopsy series in up
to 7% of patients who die of cancer. Most splenic metasta-
ses are microscopic and are not detected by imaging studies.
The most common tumors to metastasize to the spleen are
malignant melanoma and lung, breast, ovary, prostate, and
stomach carcinoma. Metastases appear as single or multiple
low-density masses. On MR, metastases are low intensity on
T1WI and high intensity on T2WI. The increased signal inten-
sity of the lesions parallel the increased signal intensity of the
normal splenic parenchyma on T2WI, and the lesions may not
be evident. Contrast enhancement is recommended for both
CT and MR demonstration of metastases. Calcification is rare.
Melanoma metastases commonly appear cystic.

    Hemangioma is the most common primary neoplasm of
the spleen, found in 14% of patients on autopsy series (26,30).
The tumor consists of vascular channels of varying size lined
by a single layer of endothelium. Imaging studies demonstrate
an appearance similar to hemangiomas in the liver. US shows a
well-defined hyperechoic mass. On CT, the lesion may appear
solid and may have central punctate or peripheral curvilin-
ear calcification. On MR, the lesion is low in signal intensity
on T1WI and high in signal intensity on T2WI. The contrast
enhancement pattern is variable (Fig. 27.28). The nodular
enhancement from the periphery described for liver hemangio-
mas is not often seen with splenic hemangiomas.

    Angiosarcoma is very rare but is still the most common
malignancy arising in the spleen (26). The tumor is aggressive,
usually presenting with widespread metastases, especially to
the liver. Imaging studies demonstrate multiple well-defined
enhancing nodules or diffuse spleen abnormality (Fig. 27.29).
Patients with thorotrast exposure are at increased risk.
