            INTERPRETATION

Normal Skeletal Scintigram. In the normal adult, skeletal tracer
uptake is fairly uniform and symmetrical. Uptake is greater in
the axial skeleton (pelvis, spine) than in the appendicular skele-
ton (skull and extremities). Mild, uniform soft tissue uptake is
noted in the background. The kidneys should be slightly hotter
than the soft tissues and should be symmetrical and normal
anatomically. The renal collecting system, ureters, and bladder
activity appear very intense. Children will demonstrate intense,
symmetrical activity in their growth plates, which need to be
evaluated carefully, preferably on the workstation.

    Trauma to the skeleton may be undetectable on standard
radiographic examinations. The classic stress fracture may be
caused by overuse of the normal skeleton or an insufficiency
fracture may result from normal use of weakened bone. Scin-
tigraphically demonstrated trauma precedes radiographi-
cally detectable fracture healing by approximately 10 days.
Decreased or normal osteoblastic activity is seen at the fracture
site in this first phase of repair. The subsequent osteoblastic
activity then shows as a "hot spot," weeks before the calcified
callus appears on a radiograph (Figs. 54.2, 54.3). In an uncom-
plicated fracture, repaired bone returns to normal appearance
as the callus at the fracture site remodels over a period of
months (Fig. 54.4). A complicated fracture in a weight-bearing
bone, healing with angulation, may take many years to return
to normal bone scan activity. Some fractures may show remod-
eling on bone scans for life. Bone scans or SPECT of the spine
is frequently useful in osteoporotic vertebral fractures, prior to
vertebroplasty. The scan evaluates for a metastatic pattern and
for the acuteness and level of the fracture.

    The three-phase bone scan can accurately diagnose shin
splints and discriminate them from the more serious stress
fracture. Shin splints demonstrate superficial, vertically ori-
ented uptake in the tibia, usually posteromedially. Stress frac-
tures are more localized and run horizontally. Recent studies

septic joints, inflammation associated with early degenerative
conditions, and connective tissue arthropathies. In early osteo-
arthropathy, high-resolution bone scan images detect increased
subchondral bone labeling long before there are radiographic
findings. Intense, abnormal labeling is also seen in neuropathic
joints long before the abnormality is detected by radiographs

typical areas of decreased labeling (Fig. 54.10).

    Abnormal Soft Tissue Uptake. Areas of increased soft tissue
uptake may be seen with tumors such as breast carcinoma or
as normal symmetrical, physiological breast uptake. Athero-
sclerotic uptake can be seen in the femoral and carotid arter-
ies. Diffuse liver uptake may be seen with diffuse liver disease
or with technical problems such as colloid formation in the
radiotracer due to aluminum contamination. Focal abnormal
uptake in the liver is usually seen with mucinous metastatic
disease such as colon or breast cancer. Soft tissue trauma,
cellulitis, bursitis, and rhabdomyolysis will also demonstrate
abnormal soft tissue uptake.

    Heterotopic Bone. Repair of soft tissue injuries sometimes
leads to the formation of heterotopic bone. Histologically,
normal bone may form from differentiating fibroblasts after
trauma. Muscle crush injuries healing with the formation of
heterotopic bone (myositis ossificans) are readily labeled on
bone scans, weeks before the plain film shows signs of calcifi-
cation. The restricting area may be safely released or resected
after the blood pool phase becomes inactive. Soft tissues
around joint prostheses, in paralyzed limbs, and in burn inju-
ries are common sites of heterotopic bone formation.

    Metabolic Conditions. Increased parathormone levels
(or the presence of tumor-produced parathormone-like sub-
stances) simultaneously increase serum calcium and phosphate.
