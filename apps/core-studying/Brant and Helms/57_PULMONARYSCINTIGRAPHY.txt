    A minimum of 60,000-Tc-99m MAA particles must be
injected to ensure reliable count statistics and image quality.
Typically, 200,000 to 500,000 particles are injected and less
than 0.1% of capillaries are temporarily and safely occluded.
However, several types of patients should receive a reduced
number of particles during a perfusion scan. Patients with pul-
monary hypertension and right to left shunts should be given
only 100,000 particles. Children should also be injected with
only 100,000 particles because they have fewer pulmonary
arterioles. To perform reduced count imaging, each perfu-
sion view is imaged for a longer time interval allowing for
nearly equivalent count statistics. Alternatively, the kit can be
reconstituted with higher than usual Tc-99m activity per par-
ticle. The normal 5-mCi dose can be administered but with
fewer particles. Contraindications to perfusion lung scanning
