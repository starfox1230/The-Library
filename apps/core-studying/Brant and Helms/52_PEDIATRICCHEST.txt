    Pulmonary Artery. An enlarged PA may represent gener-
alized increased pulmonary blood flow, poststenotic dilation
caused by valvular pulmonic stenosis (Fig. 50.63), or pulmo-
nary valve insufficiency caused by increased right ventricular
output. An enlarged PA will often be higher in position than a
normal PA and can be mistaken for a large aortic arch. A small
or absent PA shadow occurs with decreased blood flow caused
by pulmonary outflow obstruction or with an abnormal posi-
tion of the PA, such as with persistent truncus arteriosus or
transposition of the great vessels.

    Aorta. Evaluation of the aorta includes estimation of size,
position, and contour abnormalities. The size of the aorta is
assessed in the region of the aortic knob. The aorta may appear
small because of hypoplasia (as in hypoplastic left heart syn-
drome) and with certain left-to-right shunts (e.g., atrial sep-
tal defect [ASD], ventricular septal defect [VSD]). Because
the aorta in children is normally small relative to adults, a
truly small aorta may be difficult to recognize. Enlargement
of the ascending aorta and the aortic knob most often repre-
sents poststenotic dilation resulting from valvular aortic steno-
sis; it may also be caused by increased aortic blood flow seen
with aortic valve insufficiency, left-to-right shunting at the
great vessels level (patent ductus arteriosus [PDA], persistent
truncus arteriosus), or severe tetralogy of Fallot. Generalized
aortic enlargement can occur with systemic hypertension. The

    Corrected Transposition of the Great Vessels (L-Transpo-
sition). In L-transposition, ventricular inversion (left to right
reversal) accompanies the transposed positions of the aorta and
the PA, resulting in functional correction of the transposition.
Blood circulates through the RA to LV to PA to the pulmonary
circulation and LA to RV to aorta to the systemic circulation.
The anatomic RV functions as an LV and vice versa. Because
the aorta lies anteriorly and to the left, this condition is often
called "L-transposition," whereas complete transposition is
called "D-transposition." Patients with the simple form of
corrected transposition tend to be asymptomatic, but patients
with coexisting cardiac defects (VSD, pulmonary stenosis, con-
duction defects) have an unfavorable prognosis. The diagnosis
is suggested radiographically by a characteristic prominence
along the upper left cardiac border that represents the right
ventricular outflow tract and the left-sided aorta (Fig. 50.71C).

    Double-outlet right ventricle is characterized by an aorta that
is anterior to or lateral to the PA and arises from the RV (Fig.

figuration of the type 1 anomaly is the "snowman" heart, so
named because of prominence of the superior mediastinum
caused by a large, inverted U-shaped vessel that empties into
the superior vena cava (Fig. 50.73). This configuration is pres-
ent only when the abnormal common pulmonary vein enters
the persistent left superior vena cava or vertical vein. In the
other forms of the type 1 anomaly and in the type 2 anomaly,
the cardiac configuration is less specific. Type 2 findings resem-
ble those of the transposition complex of lesions. In the type
1 anomaly, when the abnormal vein empties into the azygos
vein, the azygos vein will be dilated.
