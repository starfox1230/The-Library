tion occur in a given patient, the possibility of a fixed lead
point is increased and surgery should be considered.

    Transient, spontaneously reducing intussusceptions are an
increasingly common finding as the use of abdominal CT and
US becomes more prevalent. Transient intussusception most
commonly involves the small bowel. The intussusception is
typically short in length, slightly echogenic at US, and smaller
in diameter than the typical ileocolic intussusception (39,40)
(Fig. 51.20). Intussusception can also occur along the course
of a gastrojejunostomy tube (41).

    Appendicitis. After approximately 2 years of age, perfo-
rated appendicitis becomes an increasingly common cause of
an obstructive pattern on radiographs. Radiographs tend to be
normal or show diminished intestinal gas with acute nonper-
forated appendicitis. After appendiceal rupture occurs, small
bowel dilatation gradually develops because of a combination of
decreased small bowel peristalsis and partial bowel obstruction
in the region of abscess formation. Symptoms may temporarily

    Urinary tract obstruction in infants and children is predom-
inantly the result of a variety of congenital and developmental
abnormalities. Urinary tract obstruction may develop at any
point along the course of the urinary tract, but the most
common sites are the ureteropelvic junction, the uretero-
vesical junction, and the bladder outlet and ureter. Congeni-
tal ureteropelvic junction obstruction may be caused by the
inadequate recanalization of the ureteral lumen during fetal
development, kinking of the ureteropelvic junction, or extrin-
sic compression by bands or aberrant vessels. Dilatation of the
renal pelvis and calyces can become severe during fetal life and
is often detected at prenatal US. Typically, with ureteropelvic
junction obstruction, the renal pelvis and calyces are dilated
but the ureter is normal in caliber (Fig. 51.45A). The severity
of obstruction can only be implied by the degree of hydro-
nephrosis on US and is more precisely evaluated using renal
scintigraphy with furosemide washout (Fig. 51.45B). MR
urography is a developing technique that may allow evalua-
tion of both detailed renal anatomy and function (97).

    Hydronephrosis accompanied by ureteral dilatation can
be seen with severe vesicoureteral reflux or obstruction at the
ureterovesical junction. Primary megaureter is an uncommon
form of congenital obstruction of the distal ureter, which results
from the abnormal development of the muscular layers of the
distal ureter. Passage of urine through the abnormal distal ure-
teral segment is ineffective because of diminished peristalsis,
resulting in functional obstruction and dilatation of the more
proximal portions of the normal ureter. Antegrade pyelograms
reveal a contracted juxtavesical portion of the ureter with pri-
mary megaureter, in comparison to a widely patent ureterovesi-

an isolated anomaly or may be associated with autosomal

detected on prenatal US. Anomalies of the male or female
reproductive system are commonly associated with unilateral
absence of the kidney. Renal agenesis results from the lack of
induction of the primitive renal tissue (i.e., metanephric blas-
tema) by the ureteral butt. Bilateral renal agenesis leads to
oligohydramnios and compression of the fetus. Fetal compres-
sion leads to abnormal facial features, skeletal abnormalities,
and severe hypoplasia. Bilateral pneumothoraces often occur

    Posterior urethral valve is the most common cause of ure-
thral obstruction in male infants. Abnormal migration and
insertion of the urethrovaginal folds result in sail-like flaps
of tissue that arise at the base of the prostatic urethra below
the verumontanum, known as Type I valves. The valves cause
obstruction to antegrade flow of urine, leading to the dilatation
of the posterior urethra, bladder wall thickening and trabecu-
lation, and vesicoureteral reflux (Fig. 51.53). Type III postero-
urethral valves consist of a membrane caused by incomplete
canalization in the region of the urogenital diaphragm. The
Type II "valve" actually consists of a nonobstructive mucosal
fold rather than an obstructing membrane. Anterior urethral
valves are rare obstructive lesions of uncertain etiology. The
valve may appear as a linear filling defect or simply an abrupt
change of caliber within the anterior urethra.

Hemorrhage occurs more frequently on the right and is occa-

easily visualized than that of the adult. The gland appears as an
inverted V-shaped structure with an echogenic central region
and a peripheral hypoechoic zone (Fig. 51.60). Hemorrhage
enlarges the gland and causes loss of the V shape. Initially, the
hematoma resembles a solid, echogenic mass (Fig. 51.61A). As
the hemorrhage resolves, it becomes increasingly hypoechoic,

    Most neuroblastomas appear echogenic and heterogeneous.
In some cases, a characteristic echogenic nodule can be iden-
tified within the larger part of the tumor mass. CT and MR
can be used to better define the extent of involvement of large
tumors and to detect metastatic deposits (Fig. 51.62B). Neuro-
blastoma metastasizes to the liver, lymph nodes, and bone mar-
row. MR demonstrates intraspinal extension, bone marrow
infiltration, and encasement of blood vessels without using IV
contrast. Skeletal metastases are shown with Tc bone scintigra-
phy. I-131-meta-iodobenzylguanidine is a tracer that resembles
norepinephrine and is metabolized by neuroblastoma, pheo-

scans can also be used to detect subtle disease, especially in the
lower stages (114).

    Other tumors of the adrenal gland are quite rare in chil-
dren. Adrenocortical carcinoma is highly malignant and
locally invasive with CT and US characteristics similar to
neuroblastoma. Adrenocortical carcinoma metastasizes to
the lungs, liver, and regional lymph nodes. The tumor fre-
quently causes endocrine symptoms such as virilization and
Cushing syndrome. Hypercortisolism may cause an increase
in retroperitoneal fat that is visible on CT and MRI and is a

is generally also present. In older children, infections such as

lesions (Fig. 51.68) can be seen with US in granulomatous
splenic infection such as Bartonella (cat-scratch fever, tuber-
culosis, or fungal infection). Splenic abscess is uncommon
in children and is most often associated with an impaired
immune system.

    Cystic masses of the spleen are uncommon and include
congenital epidermoid cysts, posttraumatic pseudocysts, and
echinococcal cysts. Cystic lymphangiomatosis is a benign
lymphatic malformation with a characteristic, multiloculated
cystic appearance. The lesion may contain calcification and
enhances on CT.

    Splenic Neoplasms. Primary neoplasms of the spleen (hem-
angioma, hamartoma, and angiosarcoma) are rare. Lymphoma
and leukemia commonly involve the spleen. However, splenic
involvement with lymphoma does not necessarily result in
splenic enlargement. Conversely, children with leukemia or
lymphoma may have an enlarged spleen without neoplastic
involvement. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is
a rare disease that consists of overactive histocytes and mac-
rophages that phagocytize the normal cellular structures of
the blood, characterized by lymphohistiocytic infiltrates in
multiple organs. This condition is not truly malignant and is
probably caused by an inappropriate immune reaction. HLH
usually occurs in infants and young children and is character-
ized by hepatosplenomegaly, ascites (Table 51.12), gallblad-

ian neoplasms in children and adolescents are germ cell tumors
(130). Mature cystic teratoma is the most common germ cell
tumor in young patients and is benign. On US, teratomas vary
from an entirely cystic mass to a predominantly solid mass
with internal cystic components. A common appearance is a
predominantly cystic mass with an echogenic nodular mass
protruding into the lumen, known as a dermoid plug or Roki-
tansky nodule (Fig. 51.75A). Calcified structure and fatty
components are typically visible but may be more easily seen
on CT (Fig. 51.75B). A recognizable tooth within the mass
is a pathognomonic finding (Fig. 51.75C). Malignant terato-
mas are accompanied by ascites, evidence of intraperitoneal
spread, and metastasis to the liver. The larger the component
of solid tissue, the more likely is the tumor to be malignant.
Less common ovarian neoplasms of childhood include dysger-
minoma, cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma, and granu-
losa cell tumor.

    Enlarged uterus is sometimes the cause of a palpable
abdominal mass. Congenital vaginal obstruction with hydro-
metrocolpos or hematometrocolpos presents in the newborn
period or at puberty. In most cases, US identifies the enlarged
uterus filled with anechoic fluid in the newborn, or echogenic
blood in the adolescent (Fig. 51.76A). MRI is useful for clas-
sifying the vaginal abnormality in older patients (Fig. 51.76B).

    Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common tumor to affect
the lower urinary tract in children. The neoplasm most often
arises from the prostate gland in males, and from the vagina in
females. The mass is usually quite large at the time of presenta-
tion and is detected early in infancy. Imaging findings include a
polypoid or grape-like mass, causing elevation of the bladder
and obstruction of the bladder neck (Fig. 51.77) (131).
