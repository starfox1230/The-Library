    Pseudodislocation of the Humerus. Another traumatic pro-
cess that can be misdiagnosed radiologically, leading to inap-
propriate treatment and morbidity, is a pseudodislocation of the
humerus (Fig. 45.13). This results from a fracture with hemar-
throsis, which causes distension of the joint and migration of
the humeral head inferiorly (9). An axial or transscapular view
shows it is not anteriorly or posteriorly dislocated (the usual
forms of shoulder dislocation) but merely inferiorly subluxated.
On an anteroposterior view, it can mimic a posterior dislocation

scan through this area shows the subarticular nature and adjacent sclerosis. The differential diagnosis of infection, eosinophilic granuloma, and
chondroblastoma was given. A ring of osteophytes (open arrowheads) was noted in retrospect on the plain film (A) in the subcapital region, which
indicates degenerative disease of the hip. Degenerative joint disease is extremely unusual in a 20-year-old healthy man; however, it makes the lytic
lesion in the femoral head almost certainly a subchondral cyst or geode. This was an active soccer player who had been playing with pain in his
hip for several years following an injury that had caused the degenerative disease. Unfortunately, a biopsy was performed anyway, and a subchon-
dral cyst or geode was confirmed.

   FIGURE 45.12. Fracture Mimicking Osteosarcoma. A. This 16-year-old patient had experienced pain around the knee for
   2 weeks before these radiographs. The knee films showed diffuse sclerosis and extensive periostitis about the distal femur,
   which is thought to be characteristic of an osteogenic sarcoma. The periosteal reaction, however, was thought to be much
   too thick, dense, and wavy to represent malignant type of periostitis. B. A small offset of the epiphysis can be seen (arrow),
   which indicates an epiphyseal slippage consistent with a Salter epiphyseal fracture. This teenager had fallen off a bicycle
   and fractured the femur, yet continued to be active. The lack of immobility caused exuberant periostitis or callus with a
   large amount of reactive sclerosis, all of which mimicked an osteogenic sarcoma.

FIGURE 45.13. Pseudodislocation of the Shoulder. A. This patient experienced trauma to the shoulder, with resultant pain and immobility, and
was thought to have a dislocation of the shoulder after the anteroposterior film was seen. The humeral head is inferiorly placed in relation to the
glenoid; however, this is not the characteristic location of an anterior or posterior dislocation. B. The transscapular view shows the humeral head
to be situated normally over the glenoid without anterior or posterior dislocation. These findings are characteristic of a pseudodislocation caused
by hemarthrosis, or blood in the joint, which allows the shoulder to be subluxed rather than dislocated. When a pseudodislocation is seen, as in
this example, search for an occult fracture should ensue. In this case as seen on (A), a fracture (arrowhead) was initially missed.

anterior in relation to the body of C2 in flexion. The odontoid or dens is difficult to see but appears to be separated from the body of C2. Because
of the smooth borders of the separated dens and because of the cortical hypertrophy of the anterior arch of C1, this can safely be called an os
odontoideum, which is a congenital or long-standing posttraumatic abnormality rather than an acute fracture. Obviously, patients with this con-
dition should have no neurologic problems, yet in many instances are still believed to be unstable and undergo surgical fusion. This, however, can
be done on an elective basis.
