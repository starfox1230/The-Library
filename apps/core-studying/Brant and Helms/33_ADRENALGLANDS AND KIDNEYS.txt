(ROI) measurement on the same image shows an average (AV) attenuation of 6.90 HU with a standard deviation (SD) of 14.63 and area (AR) of
80.24 mm2. This attenuation measurement combined with the imaging features of the lesion is diagnostic of benign lipid-rich cortical adenoma.
Note that this 5-mm thick slice was selected because it was at the center of the lesion. The ROI cursor is centered within the cross-sectional area
of the lesion, and the ROI measures greater than 50% of the cross-sectional area. ROI measurements must be made according to the standards
established for adrenal lesion characterization on CT.

neoplasms (28). It is most common in men (3-5:1) and usually
presents at age 50 to 70 years. RCC is now known to repre-
sent a family of related tumors with differing pathologic prop-
erties, prognoses, and imaging characteristics. Pathologies
include conventional clear cell adenocarcinoma (80%), multi-
locular clear cell carcinoma (5%), papillary RCC (15%),
chromophobe RCC (5%), renal medullary carcinoma (<1%),
and others (29). Chromophobe tumors have the best progno-
sis. Predisposing conditions for RCC include von Hippel-
Lindau disease, hereditary papillary RCC, acquired renal
cystic disease associated with long-term dialysis, cigarette
smoking, renal transplantation, and HIV infection. Most
tumors are solitary, but some (6%) are multifocal, and a few
(4%) are bilateral. Any solid renal mass should be considered
a suspect for RCC (Fig. 32.19). Hemorrhage and necrosis
are common. Cystic and multicystic forms (5% to 10%)
(Figs. 32.20, 32.21) are also seen.

    Staging (Table 32.3) is critical to the selection of expand-
ing options for treatment. Small RCC (<3 cm) have been
treated with laparoscopic partial nephrectomy or percutane-
ous radiofrequency ablation with good results. Prognosis is
related to stage and tumor type but varies unpredictably in
individual cases. Radiologic evaluation involves tumor detec-
tion and characterization as well as staging. A review of Table

Large tumors demonstrate a stellate central scar that is sugges-
tive of the diagnosis. MR shows low tumor signal on T1WI
and higher tumor signal on T2WI, overlapping the appearance
of RCC. If a central scar is present, it appears as stellate low
signal on both T1WI and T2WI (30). Oncocytomas are indis-
tinguishable from RCC by all imaging methods and must be
surgically removed to confirm the diagnosis (28).

    Lymphoma. Although primary renal lymphoma is rare, the
kidney is commonly involved by metastatic lymphoma or by
direct invasion. Most cases are non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Fig.
32.24). Patterns of renal involvement include diffuse disease
enlarging the kidney, multiple bilateral solid renal masses,
solitary bulky tumor, perirenal tumor surrounding the kidney,
and tumor invasion from the retroperitoneum into the renal
sinus (32). CT shows lymphoma as homogenous and poorly
enhancing. Extensive retroperitoneal adenopathy favors the
diagnosis. On MR, lymphoma is isointense or slightly hypoin-
tense to renal parenchyma on T1WI, hypointense on T2WI,
and shows minimal heterogeneous enhancement post contrast
(30).

enous metastases; however, most are detected late in the course
of malignancy. Most metastases appear as multiple, bilateral,

obstruction, immune system compromise, drug abuse, chronic
debilitating disease, and incomplete antibiotic treatment. CT is
normal in some patients with mild uncomplicated pyelonephri-
tis. In most patients, edema causes diffuse or focal swelling.
Areas of high-attenuation on precontrast scans suggest hemor-
rhagic inflammation. Contrast enhancement reveals streaks and
wedges of low attenuation extending to the renal capsule (the
"striated nephrogram") (Fig. 32.34), often associated with
thickened septa in perinephric fat and thickening of Gerota fas-
cia. Inflammatory low-density masses may form in the renal
parenchyma. A variety of confusing terms, including lobar neph-
ronia and focal bacterial nephritis, have been applied to these
masses. The Society of Uroradiology recommends abandoning
these terms and using only the terms "acute pyelonephritis" with
or without "focal, multifocal, or diffuse swelling." Complications
of acute pyelonephritis include intrarenal (Fig. 32.28) and perire-
nal abscess (Fig. 32.35). MR findings are similar to those of CT
with renal enlargement due to edema and hemorrhage, and peri-
nephric fluid collections. Obstructing calculi and gas are well
demonstrated by CT but are more easily overlooked on MR.

    Emphysematous pyelonephritis is a form of acute pyelone-
phritis with air in the renal parenchyma. Most cases occur in
patients with diabetes, obstruction, or immune compromise.
The condition is rapidly progressive and often life threatening.
Mixed flora infection with gram-negative organisms is most
common. Plain radiographs and CT demonstrate streaks and
collections of gas within the renal parenchyma (Fig. 32.36).
Emphysematous pyelitis refers to infection with gas confined
to the renal collecting system, sparing the parenchyma. The
infection is less aggressive and morbidity is not as high.

    Chronic Pyelonephritis and Reflux Nephropathy. Chronic
pyelonephritis refers to chronic interstitial nephritis caused
by infection (39). In children, vesicoureteral reflux of infected
urine is the most common cause of chronic pyelonephritis.
Intrarenal reflux, usually most prominent at the upper pole
within compound calyces, damages the papilla, resulting in
