    L pneumophila. Legionnaires disease is caused by infec-
tion with L pneumophila, a gram-negative bacillus commonly
found in air conditioning and humidifier systems. This infec-
tion tends to affect older men. Community-acquired infection
is seen in patients with COPD or malignancy, whereas nosoco-
mial infection primarily affects immunocompromised patients
or those with renal failure or malignancy.

    The characteristic radiographic pattern is airspace opaci-
fication, which is initially peripheral and sublobar. In some
patients, the airspace opacities appear as a round pneumo-
nia. The infection progresses to lobar or multilobar involve-
ment despite the initiation of antibiotic therapy. At the peak
of disease, the parenchymal involvement is usually bilateral.
Pleural effusions are seen in approximately 30% of patients.
Cavitation is not seen except in the immunocompromised
patient (Fig. 16.4). The radiographic resolution of pneu-
monia is often prolonged and may lag behind symptomatic
improvement.

    Respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus are
common causes of epidemic viral pneumonia in children. When
seen in adults, the disease is usually in the setting of a debili-
tated or immunocompromised patient (Fig. 16.13). Findings
are similar to other viral pneumonias: patchy airspace opaci-
ties, bronchial wall thickening, and tree-in-bud opacities.

    Varicella-zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shin-
gles, may produce a severe pneumonia in adults. Patients on
immunosuppressive therapy or with lymphoma are at great-
est risk. Chest radiographs characteristically show diffuse
bilateral ill-defined nodular opacities 5 to 10 mm in diameter.
These opacities usually resolve completely; however, in some
patients these opacities involute and calcify to produce innu-
merable small (2 to 3 mm) calcified nodules (Fig. 16.14).
