ment (Table 31.1). An early fine, granular pattern is produced
by mucosal hyperemia and edema that precedes ulceration.
Superficial ulcers spread to cover the entire mucosal surface.
The mucosa is stippled with barium adhering to the superficial
ulcers. Collar button ulcers (Fig. 31.16) are deeper ulcerations
of thickened edematous mucosa with crypt abscesses extend-
ing into the submucosa. A coarse granular pattern is produced
later by the replacement of diffusely ulcerated mucosa with
granulation tissue. Late changes include a variety of polypoid
lesions. Pseudopolyps are mucosal remnants in areas of exten-
sive ulceration. Inflammatory polyps are small islands of
inflamed mucosa. Postinflammatory polyps are mucosal tags
that are seen in quiescent phases of the disease. Filiform pol-
yps are postinflammatory polyps with a characteristic worm-
like appearance (Fig. 31.10). They are typically seen in an
otherwise normal appearing colon. Hyperplastic polyps may
occur during healing after mucosal injury. Involvement typi-
cally extends from the rectum proximally in a symmetric and
continuous pattern. The terminal ileum is nearly always nor-
mal. Rare backwash ileitis may produce an ulcerated but pat-
ulous terminal ileum. CT findings include (1) wall thickening,
often with "halo sign" of low-density submucosal edema (Fig.
31.17); (2) narrowing of the lumen of the colon; and (3) pseu-
dopolyps and pneumatosis coli with megacolon. Complications
of ulcerative colitis include (1) strictures (Fig. 31.18), usually
2 to 3 cm or more in length and commonly involving the
transverse colon and the rectum; (2) colorectal adenocarci-
noma, with an approximate risk of 1% per year of disease; (3)
toxic megacolon (2% to 5% of cases) may be the initial mani-
festation; and (4) massive hemorrhage. Associated extraintes-

amebae. Encysted amebae are ingested with contaminated food
and water. The cyst capsule is dissolved in the small bowel,
releasing trophozoites that migrate to the colon and burrow
into the mucosa, forming small abscesses. The infection can
spread throughout the body by hematogenous embolization
or direct invasion. Amebic colitis produces dysentery with
frequent bloody mucoid stools. Barium studies demonstrate a
disease that closely mimics Crohn colitis with aphthous ulcers,
deep ulcers, asymmetric disease, and skip areas. The cecum and
