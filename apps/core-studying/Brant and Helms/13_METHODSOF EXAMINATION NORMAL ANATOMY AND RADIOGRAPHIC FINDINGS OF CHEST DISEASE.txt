aorta. These two structures then rotate from right to left as
they ascend in the mediastinum until the pulmonary artery
lies at the 5-o'clock position. The left pulmonary artery is a
direct continuation of the main pulmonary artery. The right
artery branches just below the carina, with an angle close to
90°. Within the left hilum, the artery envelopes the upper
margin of the left main bronchus, at which point it divides
into the upper and lower lobe arteries. The arch formed by

    The paraspinal interface is a straight, vertical interface
extending the length of the right hemithorax and represents
contact of the right lung with a small amount of tissue lat-
eral to the thoracic spine. It is inconsistently visualized on the

paraspinal disease.

    The right heart projects just to the right of the lateral margin
of the thoracic spine on a normal PA radiograph (Fig. 12.11).
This portion of the heart is the lateral margin of the right atrium,
which creates a smooth convex interface with the medial seg-
ment of the middle lobe. Individuals with pectus excavatum
have leftward cardiac displacement and may not demonstrate
this interface. In patients with right atrial dilatation, this inter-
face may extend well into the right lung.

seen at the level of the right hemidiaphragm as a concave lateral
interface. The inferior vena caval interface is best visualized on

left hemidiaphragm is obliterated (silhouetted) by the cardiac
contact, whereas the right hemidiaphragm is seen in its entire
anteroposterior course. On a well-positioned left lateral chest
radiograph, with the right side of the thorax farther from the
x-ray cassette than the left, the right anterior and posterior
costophrenic sulci should project beyond the corresponding
left-sided sulci as a result of x-ray beam divergence. Identifica-
tion of the right and left costophrenic sulci allows identification
of the corresponding hemidiaphragms. The presence of air in
the stomach or splenic flexure projecting above one hemidia-
phragm and below another identifies the more cephalad struc-
ture as the left hemidiaphragm. Occasionally, when the right
and left major fissures are distinguishable (the left is more ver-
tically oriented than the right), following a major fissure to its
point of contact with the diaphragm will allow identification
of that hemidiaphragm.

     Anatomy of the Normal Mediastinum

                  and Thoracic Inlet

The mediastinum is a narrow, vertically oriented structure that
resides between the medial parietal pleural layers of the lungs.
It contains central cardiovascular, tracheobronchial structures
and the esophagus enveloped in fat with intermixed lymph
nodes (Fig. 12.16) (Table 12.6) (14). The thoracic inlet struc-
tures are best depicted by CT and MR (Fig 12.17A). Several
