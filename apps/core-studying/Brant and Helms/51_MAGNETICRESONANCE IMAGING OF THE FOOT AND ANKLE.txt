posterior talofibular ligament will rarely tear.

    Several entities have a high association with chronic tears
of the lateral ligaments. These include chronic lateral ankle
instability, sinus tarsi syndrome, split tears of the peroneus
brevis, and anterolateral impingement syndrome.

    Patients with sinus tarsi syndrome present with lateral
ankle pain and tenderness and a perception of hindfoot insta-
bility. The sinus tarsi is the cone-shaped space between the
talus and the calcaneus that opens up laterally. It is a fat-filled
space through which traverse several important ligaments that
provide subtalar stability. In sinus tarsi syndrome, these liga-
ments are torn and the fat is replaced with granulation tissue
or scar tissue. Hence, on T2WI, there may be high (granula-
tion tissue) or low (scar) signal, but on T1WI, there is low
signal in the sinus tarsi (Fig. 49.16). In the acutely sprained
ankle, the sinus tarsi may have replacement of the fat due to
hemorrhage and edema, which will resolve.

    Anterolateral impingement syndrome results from hyper-
trophy and scarring of the synovium in the lateral gutter of
the ankle. The lateral gutter is the space between the tibia and
the fibula and is bound by the lateral ankle ligaments. Patients
with anterolateral impingement syndrome present with lateral
