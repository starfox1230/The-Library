tract. The right kidney (between short straight arrows), edge of the liver (long straight arrow), edge of the spleen (open

    Motion artifact results when structures move to different
positions during image acquisition. Motion occurs as a result of
voluntary or involuntary patient movement, breathing, heart-
beat, vessel pulsation, or peristalsis. Motion is demonstrated
in the image as prominent streaks from high- to low-density
interfaces or as blurred or duplicated images (Fig. 1.12).

    Streak artifacts emanate from high-density sharp-edged
objects such as vascular clips and dental fillings (Fig. 1.13).
Reconstruction algorithms cannot handle the extreme differ-
ences in x-ray attenuation between very dense objects and
adjacent tissue.

    Ring artifacts occur when the CT scanner is out of calibra-
tion and detectors give erroneous readings at each angle of
rotation. Ring artifacts are seen as high- or low-density circu-
lar rings in the image.

    Quantum mottle artifacts produce noise in the image seen
as salt-and-pepper pattern of random dark and light specks
throughout the image. The image noise results from insuffi-
cient x-ray transmission data caused by inappropriate radia-
tion settings for the size of the patient.

CT interpretation is based on an organized and comprehensive

    Doppler US is an important adjunct to real-time gray-
scale imaging. The Doppler effect is a shift in the frequency of
returning echoes, compared with the transmitted pulse, caused
by reflection of the sound wave from a moving object. In medi-
cal imaging, the moving objects of interest are red blood cells
in flowing blood. If blood flow is relatively away from the face
of the transducer, the echo frequency is shifted lower. If blood
flow is relatively toward the face of the transducer, the echo
frequency is shifted higher. The amount of frequency shift is
proportional to the relative velocity of the red blood cells.

    Doppler US can detect not only the presence of blood flow
but can also determine its direction and velocity. The Doppler
frequency shift is in the audible range, producing a sound of
blood flow that has additional diagnostic value. Pulsed Doppler
uses a Doppler sample volume that is time-gated to interrogate
only a select volume of patient tissue for the Doppler shift.
Duplex Doppler combines real-time gray-scale imaging with
pulsed Doppler to enable accurate placement of the Doppler
sample volume in visualized blood vessels or specific areas of
interest. Color Doppler combines gray scale and color-coded
Doppler information in a single image (Fig. 1.22). Stationary
tissue with echoes having no Doppler shift are displayed in
shades of gray, whereas blood flow and moving tissue produc-
ing echoes having a detectable Doppler shift are displayed in
color. Blood flow relatively toward the transducer face is usu-
ally displayed in shades of red, whereas blood flow relatively
away from the transducer face is displayed in shades of blue.
Lighter-color shades imply higher flow velocities. Doppler US
is discussed in detail in Chapter 39.

    US Artifacts. Artifacts are extremely common in US imag-
ing and must be recognized to avoid diagnostic errors (27).
Some artifacts, such as acoustic shadowing and enhancement,
are diagnostically useful.

    Acoustic shadowing is produced by nearly complete
absorption or reflection of the US beam, obscuring deeper tis-
sue structures. Acoustic shadows are produced by gallstones
(Fig. 1.23), urinary tract stones, bone, metallic objects, and
gas bubbles. The presence of acoustic shadowing aids in the
identification of all types of calculi.

    Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis. For many years, gadolinium-
based MR contrast agents were considered to be among the saf-
est drugs in medical practice. Gadolinium contrast-enhanced
MR was frequently recommended as a substitute for iodinated
contrast enhanced CT in patients with impaired renal function
and concern for contrast-induced nephropathy. In 1997 a new,
rare, sclerosing skin disease was recognized in patients with
chronic renal failure (36). Identification of additional cases led
to the recognition that the disease was not confined to the skin
but could affect multiple organs including liver, lungs, mus-
cles, and heart. The name nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)
was applied to the condition. In 2006, publications appeared
linking NSF to the use of gadolinium in patients with impaired
renal function. Cases were being recognized worldwide. Signs
of NSF were recognized within hours to within 30 days of
exposure to gadolinium agents (37). Clinically, NSF varies in
its manifestations from patient to patient and over time. Skin
changes start as an erythematous rash with non-pitting swell-
ing and intense itching of affected areas. Pain, dysesthesias, and
hyperesthesias develop. Intense neuropathy leads to difficulty
walking and painful disability. The dermis becomes thickened,
hardened, and inflexible leading to contractures that impair
joint mobility. Affected skin becomes hyperpigmented. Severe
cases lead to complete disability with patients being unable to
