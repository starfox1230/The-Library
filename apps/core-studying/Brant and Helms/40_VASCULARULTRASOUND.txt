little or no forward flow during diastole (Fig. 39.4A). Blood
flow direction may reverse briefly during early diastole pro-
ducing a triphasic waveform. Blood flow in high-resistance
arteries is always under considerable pressure and encounters
constricted arterioles that impede forward blood flow. Pulse
pressures traveling down the arterial tree are highly reflected,
which results in minimal flow to the capillary bed during
diastole. Diastolic flow velocity is low, absent, or reversed,
and pulse pressure is high. The ratio of systolic velocity to
diastolic velocity (pulsatility) is high. Arteries that normally

    Plaque Characterization. Plaques may be characterized as
homogeneous or heterogeneous in US appearance (Fig. 39.12)
(14). Homogenous plaques have a smooth contour and uni-
form internal architecture. They may be fibrous and soft or
calcified and hard. Heterogeneous plaques contain intraplaque
hemorrhage and increased amounts of lipid. They are fragile,
unstable, may ulcerate, and are prone to embolize resulting in
transient ischemic attacks, amaurosis fugax, and stroke. Ulcer-
ated plaques show an irregular plaque surface on gray-scale US
and eddy currents on CD (Fig. 39.14). All ulcerated plaques

are heterogeneous but not all heterogeneous plaques ulcerate.       1

Plaque calcification is a nonspecific finding and is seen in both

homogeneous and heterogeneous plaque (18). Densely calcified

plaque may cause acoustic shadowing and block Doppler inter-

rogation. Increasing evidence indicates that the identification of

vulnerable plaque (heterogeneous and ulcerated plaque) in com-

bination with biochemical markers of atherosclerotic disease           A

The EDV (>100 cm/s) helps in distinguishing high-grade from

    Since the NASCET study, many investigators have published
revised criteria for grading ICA stenosis. These studies dem-
onstrate the wide variability between vascular laboratories.
Most vascular laboratories in North America have adopted
the NASCET criteria (percent stenosis) for grading carotid dis-
ease. Since the distal lumen diameter of the ICA varies among
normal individuals and is affected by perfusion pressure, many
investigators believe residual lumen diameter is more accurate
and a better predictor of stroke. A residual lumen diameter of

filled with echogenic thrombus. A brief systolic pulse (followed
by a flow reversal) is usually present at the proximal end of the
obstruction due to the "thumping" of blood against the occlu-
sion (called "thud flow"). The CCA waveform has a high-
resistance flow pattern with decreased diastolic flow velocity

"externalization of the CCA" (Fig. 39.18). If the patient has

CAROTID DUPLEX EXAMINATION AND INTERPRETATION CHECKLIST

   1. All carotid examinations should be standardized so as to be reproducible
   2. All examinations should include gray-scale imaging, color Doppler imaging, and spectral Doppler velocity measurements
   3. The color Doppler sampling box should be sized to the region of interest. The angle of incidence should be adjusted to ensure a

       Doppler angle of <60° to the direction of blood flow
   4. Keep the spectral Doppler sample volume small and centered within the area of maximum flow velocity shown by color Doppler
   5. Keep the spectral Doppler angle <60°
   6. Is the CCA flow normal? (50-125 cm/s)
   7. If CCA velocities are normal and symmetric, use the PSV to grade stenosis
   8. If CCA velocities abnormal or asymmetric, use ICA/CCA PSV ratio and search for cause
   9. Diagnose "normal ICA" if no plaque or intimal thickening is present and PSV is <125 cm/s
  10. Diagnose "less than 50% ICA stenosis" when plaque or intimal thickening is present and ICA PSV is <125 cm/s, ICA/CCA PSV

       ratio is <2.0, and ICA EDV is <40 cm/s
  11. Diagnose "50%-69% ICA stenosis" when plaque is present and ICA PSV is between 125 and 230 cm/s, ICA/CCA PSV ratio is

       2.0 to 4.0, ICA EDV is 40-100 cm/s
  12. Diagnose "70% or greater ICA stenosis" when plaque is present and ICA PSV is >230 cm/s, ICA/CCA PSV ratio is >4.0, and

       ICA EDV is >100 cm/s
  13. Diagnose "near-occlusion of the ICA" when color or power Doppler shows flow only within a markedly narrowed lumen.

       Velocity parameters are unreliable in this setting and may be high, low, or undetectable. Use of US-contrast agents significantly
       improves detection of string flow
  14. Diagnose "total ICA occlusion suspected" when gray-scale US shows no patent lumen and spectral, color, and power Doppler
       show no flow. This diagnosis should be confirmed by catheter angiography, CT angiography, or MR angiography

FIGURE 39.41. Thoracic Outlet Syndrome: Arterial. A. With the arm at the patient's side, the waveform in the left subclavian artery is a normal
triphasic high-resistance pattern. B. Abduction of the left arm causes complete obliteration of the left radial pulse on physical exam. The Doppler
tracing confirms the clinical finding demonstrating complete absence of flow in the subclavian artery. C. For comparison, the right subclavian
artery has normal triphasic, high-resistance waveform with the arm at the patient's side. D. With abduction of the right arm the spectral wave-
form does not change, indicating the absence of thoracic outlet syndrome.
