    Nephrolithiasis refers to the presence of calculi in the renal
collecting system. Nearly 10% of the population will form
a renal stone in their lifetime. Sufficient calcium oxalate or
calcium phosphate is present in 80% of renal calculi for them
to be radiopaque on conventional radiographs. Brushite (2% to
4%) is a unique form of calcium phosphate stones that tends to
recur quickly if patients are not treated aggressively. Brushite
stones are resistant to treatment with shock wave lithotripsy.
Struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) stones, formed in
the presence of alkaline urine and infection, make up another
5% 15% of renal calculi and are also radiopaque on radio-
graphs. Struvite is the most common component of staghorn
calculi (Fig. 33.4). Cystine stones comprise 1% to 2% of renal
stones, are mildly radiopaque, and are found only in patients
with congenital cystinuria. Uric acid and xanthine stones
(5% to 10%) are radiolucent on conventional radiographs. A
major advantage of noncontrast CT is that (nearly) all stones
are opaque on CT (Table 33.1). The primary limitation of CT
is small size of the stone rather than its attenuation. High CT
attenuation makes calculi (200 H) easy to differentiate from
other collecting system lesions such as tumors, hematoma, fun-
gus balls, or sloughed papilla, which are all usually lesser than
50 H. Dual-energy CT has been successfully used to determine
the chemical composition of stones (12).

FIGURE 33.5. Noncontrast Renal Stone CT. A. CT image through the kidneys in a patient with left flank pain demonstrates mild enlargement
of the left renal pelvis (arrow). Streaks and strands of edema (arrowhead) are seen in the fat adjacent to the renal pelvis. B. CT in a different
patient with a stone in the distal ureter shows mild hydronephrosis (arrow) associated with fluid in the perinephric space (arrowhead). These find-
ings indicate rupture of the collecting system at a fornix resulting from high-grade obstruction and high urine output. C. A stone (arrow) at the
ureteropelvic junction is apparent in this patient. Absence of hydronephrosis or edema in the perinephric fat indicates that obstruction is very low
grade. Note the rim of tissue around the stone is somewhat obscured by bloom artifact from the marked high attenuation of the stone. D. A stone
in the left ureter (arrow) has impacted at the level of the pelvic brim. Note the irregular shape characteristic of renal stones. The rim of soft tissue
density surrounding the stone represents the swollen wall of the ureter (tissue rim sign). E. CT at the level of the seminal vesicles (S) shows a high-
density stone (arrow) in the distal left ureter. The "tissue rim sign" is evident. "All" urinary tract stones appear "white" on CT viewed at soft
tissue windows. F. A more caudal image at the level of the base of the prostate (P) shows a phlebolith (arrow), not to be mistaken for a ureteral
stone. The location is below the level of the distal ureter and the calcification lacks a tissue rim sign. The tubular structure (arrowhead) extending
from the calcification represents the thrombosed vein (the tail sign). B, bladder.

    CT cystogram may be performed using similar technique.
A minimum of 250 cc of contrast agent is instilled into the
bladder through a catheter. CT is sensitive to small amounts of
contrast that may leak into the perivesical tissues. Air instilled
into the bladder has also been used to perform "CT cystos-
copy" (25). Patients are scanned in supine and prone positions
to outline lesions that project into the lumen.

    US examination of the pelvis is routinely preformed using the
urine-filled bladder as a sonographic window to pelvic organs.
Intraluminal masses, calculi, bladder wall thickness, and blad-
der emptying can be reliably assessed by US (see Chapter 36).

The entire anterior urethra is lined by the glands of Littre (see

ducts and the utricle occasionally fill with contrast during ure-
thrography in a normal patient. The filling of these structures
with contrast occurs much more commonly in the presence
of urethral strictures. Visualization of the glands of Littre is
always abnormal and associated with chronic inflammation

urethra is embedded in the anterior wall of the vagina and is
lined throughout by periurethral glands. On MR, the urethra
is isointense with the vaginal muscle on T1WI. On T2WI, the
