    Nodules in Cirrhosis. Nodules are a constant feature of
cirrhosis (Table 26.3), and the challenge is to differentiate the
ubiquitous benign nodule from HCC (20,21). HCC may arise
de novo or as a stepwise process from a regenerative nodule to
low-grade dysplastic nodule to high-grade dysplastic nodule to
small HCC to large HCC (21,22).

    Regenerative nodules (Fig. 26.8) are the most common
nodule and are a regular pathologic feature of cirrhosis due
to attempted repair of hepatocyte injury. Regenerative nodules
are composed primarily of hepatocytes that are surrounded by
coarse fibrous septations. Small regenerative nodules (<3 mm)
produce the micronodular pattern of cirrhosis. Larger regen-
erative nodules (>3 mm) produce the macronodular pattern
of cirrhosis. Very large regenerative nodules (up to 5 cm) can

hyperintense, poorly marginated, 1.8 cm nodule in the left hepatic lobe. Hyperintensity on T2WI is rare for dysplastic or regenerative nodules but
is highly characteristic of HCC. B. T1-weighted in-phase image shows the low-signal ill-defined nodule. C. T1-weighted out-of-phase image
shows distinct loss of signal indicating the presence of intracellular fat, a finding seen in HCC and hepatic adenomas. D. Postcontrast arterial
phase image shows a ring-like peripheral enhancement of the lesion. Arterial phase enhancement is a key finding in the imaging diagnosis of HCC.
Prominent early enhancement of a tangle of portosystemic collateral vessels (curved arrow) is also present in this patient with advanced cirrhosis
and in hepatic arterioportal shunting. E. Portal venous phase postcontrast image shows early washout of contrast from the nodule, which has
become slightly hypointense to the enhanced hepatic parenchyma. This is another key finding of HCC on postcontrast images. Also noted is the
enhancement of paraumbilical collateral vessels (arrowhead), a specific sign of advanced portal hypertension. Using the American Association for

deserve further imaging.

    Mimics of HCC include the vaguely termed "nonspecific
arterially enhancing lesions," pseudolesions, and THADs (22).
These lesions are features of cirrhosis related to arterioportal
shunts and fibrotic obstruction of the portal vein. The involved
area is usually isointense to cirrhotic parenchyma on T1WI
and T2WI. HCC commonly becomes hypointense to the sur-
rounding liver on delayed imaging, whereas these nonspecific
lesions are usually isointense on delayed imaging.

    Confluent fibrosis describes mass-like areas of fibrosis
found in livers with advanced cirrhosis (25). Extensive fibro-
sis produces a wedge-shaped mass radiating from the porta
hepatis associated with parenchymal atrophy and flattening or
retraction of the liver capsule. Volume loss of the affected por-
tion of the liver is a key feature. The central portion of the right
hepatic lobe is most often involved. The lesion is low attenu-
ation on noncontrast CT. On arterial phase postcontrast CT,
most lesions (60%) show little to no enhancement, whereas the
remainder isoenhance with liver parenchyma. On portal venous
phase, most lesions are hypodense or isodense to liver paren-
chyma, whereas 17% showed hyperenhancement (Fig. 26.10).
On MR, the areas of fibrosis are hypointense to liver paren-
chyma on T1WI. On T2WI, signal intensity depends on the
chronicity of the fibrosis. Acute fibrosis has high fluid content
and appears bright on T2WI. Chronic fibrosis is low in fluid
content and appears dark on T2WI. Postcontrast MR shows
negligible enhancement on arterial phase and late enhancement
on delayed venous phase.

    Portal hypertension is a pathological increase in portal
venous pressure that results in the formation of portosystemic
collateral vessels that divert blood flow away from the liver and
into the systemic circulation. Causes of portal hypertension
include progressive vascular fibrosis associated with chronic
liver disease, portal vein thrombosis or compression, and para-
sitic infections (schistosomiasis). Portal hypertension carries the
risk of hemorrhage from varices and hepatic encephalopathy.
The signs of portal hypertension include (Figs. 26.7, 26.9): (1)
visualization of portosystemic collaterals (coronary, gastroe-
sophageal, splenorenal, paraumbilical, hemorrhoidal, and ret-
roperitoneal) (26); (2) increased portal vein diameter (>13 mm);
(3) increased superior mesenteric and splenic vein diameters
(>10 mm); (4) portal vein thrombosis; (5) calcifications in the
portal and mesenteric veins; (6) edema in the mesentery, omen-
tum, and retroperitoneum; (7) splenomegaly due to vascular
congestion; (8) ascites; and (9) reversal of flow in any portion of
the portal venous system (hepatofugal flow) (27).

    Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-

vascular dysplasia, resulting in multiple telangiectasias and
arteriovenous malformations (44). Telangiectasias are thin-
walled dilated vascular channels that appear on the skin and
mucous membranes as well as throughout the body on multiple
organs. Patients present with epistaxis and intestinal bleeding.
About 30% of patients have diffuse telangiectasias and mul-
tiple arteriovenous fistulas in the liver. These can result in pain,
jaundice, portal hypertension, and high-output cardiac failure.

    Imaging signs of biliary dilation include (1) multiple branch-
ing tubular, round, or oval structures that course toward the
porta hepatis, (2) diameter of IHBDs larger than 40% of the
diameter of the adjacent portal vein (Fig. 26.32), (3) dilation
of the common duct greater than 6 mm, and (4) gallbladder
diameter greater than 5 cm, when obstruction is distal to the
cystic duct. The "double duct" sign refers to dilatation of both
the CBD and the pancreatic duct in the head of the pancreas.
Dilatation of both the ducts is usually caused by a tumor at
the ampulla. Benign disease is responsible for approximately
75% of cases of obstructive jaundice in the adult, whereas
malignant disease causes the remainder. Gradual tapering of
a dilated common duct suggests benign stricture. Gallstones
may be identified in the bile duct surrounded by a crescent of
bile. Abrupt termination of a dilated common duct is charac-
teristic of a malignant process (53).

    Infected bile is present in up to 10% of cases of complete
biliary obstruction and 60% of cases of partial or intermit-
tent biliary obstruction. IV antibiotic therapy is warranted
prior to biliary interventional procedures in the obstructed
patient.

    Causes of biliary dilation and obstruction (Table 26.9)
include the following.

    Choledocholithiasis is responsible for approximately 20%
of cases of obstructive jaundice in the adult (Fig. 26.33). Gall-
stones are present in the gallbladder in 10% of the population,

include liver abscess, biloma, pancreatitis, cholangiocarci-

    Caroli disease is an uncommon congenital anomaly of the
biliary tract characterized by saccular ectasia of the IHBD
without biliary obstruction (50,59). Only one hepatic lobe or
segment, or the entire liver, may be affected. The EHBD are
spared in 50% of cases. Findings include (1) saccular dilata-
tion of IHBD giving the appearance on cross-sectional imag-
ing of scattered intrahepatic cysts that communicate with the
biliary tree (Fig. 26.37); (2) enhancing fibrovascular bundles
are seen centrally within many of the dilated ducts producing
the characteristic "central dot sign"; (3) segmental distribu-
tion of the bile duct abnormality with normal appearance of
unaffected liver segments; (4) cholangiography shows a char-
acteristic pattern of focal biliary narrowing and saccular dila-
tation; and (5) dilatation of the CBD (10 to 30 mm) in half the
cases. The disease is associated with medullary sponge kidney
and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. Complica-
tions include pyogenic cholangitis, liver abscess, and biliary
stones. Cholangiocarcinoma develops in 7% of cases. Most
cases present in childhood. Autosomal recessive inheritance is
evident in many cases.

    Choledochal cysts are uncommon congenital anomalies
of the biliary tree characterized by cystic dilation of the bile
ducts (50). Many (60%) present in infancy or childhood,
while the remainder are not discovered until adulthood. Some

    Pancreatic and ampullary carcinomas are the cause of
20% to 25% of cases of biliary obstruction in the adult. Meta-
static diseases from lung, breast, GI tumors, and lymphoma
account for 2% of cases.

    Metastases may present as intraductal filling defects (60).
Colorectal cancers are the most common primary tumors
associated with intraluminal biliary metastases. Findings that
favor metastases over cholangiocarcinoma are the presence of
a contiguous parenchymal mass and expansion of the duct at
the site of the intraluminal mass in a patient with known col-
orectal cancer.

    Cholangiocarcinoma is the second most common malig-
nant primary hepatic tumor (61,62). Tumors arise from the
epithelium of bile ducts and are usually adenocarcinomas
(90%). Growth patterns include mass-forming, periductal
infiltrating, and intraductal polypoid. Cross-sectional imaging
is used to detect adenopathy and hepatic metastases. Prognosis
is poor, with less than 20% of tumors being resectable.

    Peripheral cholangiocarcinoma (10%) presents as an intra-
hepatic hypodense mass sometimes (25%) causing periph-
eral biliary dilatation (Fig. 26.40). MDCT demonstrates a
homogeneous low-attenuation mass with delayed, mild, thin,
incomplete, rim-like enhancement (61). Additional findings
may include capsular retraction and satellite nodules.

    Hilar cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor) (25%) occurs
near the junction of the right and left bile ducts (Fig. 26.41).
The tumor is usually small, poorly differentiated, aggressive,
and causes obstruction of both ductal systems (63). Surgical
resection is the only hope for cure. Imaging is vital in deter-
mining surgical candidates.

to the common recommendation to follow at 6- to 12-month
intervals gallbladder polyps in the range of 5 to 10 mm. This
is based on the theory of adenoma-to-carcinoma development
found in the GI tract.

    Gallbladder carcinoma may present as a polypoid mass.
Gallbladder polyps larger than 10 mm should be considered
for surgical removal because of the risk of cancer. Gallstones
are usually present.

    Adenomyomatosis may be focal and present as a polypoid
mass fixed to the gallbladder wall.

    Acute Cholecystitis. Acute inflammation of the gallbladder
is caused by gallstones obstructing the cystic duct in 90% of
cases. Acalculous cholecystitis occurs nearly always in patients
with predisposing conditions listed subsequently. US findings
combined with clinical assessment is usually diagnostic.

    Confident US diagnosis of acute cholecystitis requires the
presence of three findings: cholelithiasis, edema of the gall-
bladder wall seen as a band of echolucency in the wall, and a
positive sonographic Murphy sign.

    Scintigraphic diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is based on
obstruction of the cystic duct with nonvisualization of the
gallbladder. The normal gallbladder demonstrates progres-
sive accumulation of radionuclide activity over 30 minutes to
1 hour following injection of technetium-99m-iminodiacetic
acid. Delayed visualization of the gallbladder may be seen in
patients with biliary stasis due to fasting or hyperalimentation.
