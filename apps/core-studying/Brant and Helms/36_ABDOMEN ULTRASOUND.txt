echogenic bile fills the gallbladder (arrowheads) producing an echo-  (arrow) within the gallbladder (GB). The mass casts a prominent
genic mass (M). Color Doppler US is essential to verify the lack of   acoustic shadows (between arrowheads) caused by the absorption of
blood flow within the mass, confirming echogenic bile and excluding   sound. Moving the patient into the upright position resulted in a

                  SPLEEN

Normal US Anatomy. The spleen is best visualized with US
with a posterolateral intercostal approach with the patient
supine (31). With the patient in a right lateral decubitus posi-
tion, the spleen may be difficult to visualize because of expan-
sion of the left lung. When the spleen is large, an anterior
subcostal approach with the patient in deep inspiration is also
useful. The splenic parenchyma is homogeneous and normally
more echogenic than the liver (Fig. 35.29). In children, the
normal spleen may appear reticulonodular rather than entirely
homogeneous. Its borders are smooth, sharply defined, and
commonly lobulated. Doppler demonstrates the splenic artery
and vein in the splenic hilum and their branches within the
spleen (5).

   Wandering spleen refers to an ectopic spleen that is pre-
disposed to torsion because of laxity of the suspensory liga-
ments of the spleen. The wandering spleen may present as an
abdominal mass or as a cause of severe abdominal pain.

   Accessory spleens (splenules) appear as rounded, well-
defined masses, in or near the splenic hilum (Fig. 35.29). They
are homogeneous and isoechoic with spleen parenchyma.

ated findings of pancreatitis confirm the diagnosis.

    Aneurysms of the splenic artery are common and pres-
ent as a hypoechoic mass in the region of the splenic hilum.
Atherosclerotic calcification in the aneurysm wall is usually
present. Doppler reveals arterial blood flow. Rupture causes
a high mortality. Pseudoaneurysms of the splenic artery are
usually caused by pancreatitis. Real-time scanning reveals a
fluid collection with thin, noncalcified walls. Doppler dem-
onstrates internal arterial flow and communication with the
splenic artery.

    Abscesses usually demonstrate echogenic fluid, layering
debris, and air although some contain anechoic fluid (Fig.
35.32) (5). US-guided percutaneous aspiration for diagnosis
and catheter placement for treatment are safe procedures.

    Microabscesses are most common in immunocompro-
mised patients. High-frequency transducers reveal multiple
tiny hypoechoic lesions. Common causes are Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, M. avium intracellulare, Candida, and Pneumo-
cystis carinii. The differential diagnosis is listed in Table 29.4.

    Lymphoma. Hypoechoic lesions in the spleen in patients
with lymphoma are very likely to be the foci of lymphoma
(Fig. 35.33). Lesions range from numerous and small to soli-
tary and large. However, the spleen may be enlarged without
lymphoma involvement or appear normal and still be diffusely
infiltrated.

    Infarctions appear hypoechoic or anechoic and are usually
wedge-shaped and characteristically extend to the splenic cap-
sule (Fig. 35.34). Parenchymal borders may be sharply defined
or irregular. Hemorrhage associated with infarction may dissect

FIGURE 35.35. Normal Pancreas Anatomy. A diagram (A) and an US in transverse plane (B) demonstrate the normal anatomy of the pancreas.
The majority of the pancreas (p) lies anterior to the splenic vein (sv) and its junction with the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) forming the portal
vein (pv). The head (H) and uncinate process (U) of the pancreas cradle the origin of the portal vein. The pancreatic neck (N) is anterior to the
SV-SMV confluence, and the uncinate process and inferior vena cava (IVC) are posterior to the confluence. The superior mesenteric artery (SMA,
arrow) arises from the aorta (Ao) dorsal to the splenic vein. The left renal vein (lrv) passes between the SMA and aorta to the inferior vena cava.
The left lobe of the liver (L) offers a good sonographic window to the pancreas. The stomach (st) and lesser sac (collapsed) are anterior to the
pancreas. CBD, common bile duct; S, spine; B, body of the pancreas; T, tail of the pancreas; p, pancreas.

calcified adrenal glands. In the neonate, adrenal hemorrhage is
usually bilateral and due to hypoxic stress. In the adult, adre-
nal hemorrhage is usually unilateral and right sided (85%).
Most adult cases of adrenal hemorrhage are associated with
blunt abdominal trauma.

    Adrenal calcifications commonly occur as a result of pre-
vious adrenal hemorrhage. Additional causes include tumor
(neuroblastoma, adrenal carcinoma, and pheochromocytoma),
infection (tuberculosis and histoplasmosis), and Wolman disease.
