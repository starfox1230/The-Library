FIGURE 59.14. Prostate Cancer. In-111 capromab pendetide (ProstaScint®) (SPECT/CT): Transaxial (A), coronal (B), sagittal (C), and MIP
SPECT/CT (D) imaging acquired through the abdominopelvic region at 1 hour postradionuclide injection demonstrates moderate diffuse radio-
tracer accumulation in the prostatic bed (arrows) in this patient who has had brachytherapy. E. Delayed transaxial imaging at 72 hours demon-
strates focal radiotracer accumulation in the left pelvic sidewall, image 19, indicating nodal metastasis (arrows).
