    Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty has traditionally
been reserved for localized lesions in one- or two-vessel disease
(Fig. 22.5), but recent published series comparing PTCA with
CABG in multivessel disease reveals no difference in the end-
points of death and myocardial infarction. The PTCA group,
however, requires a significantly higher number of repeat pro-
cedures during follow-up, although this has improved with
more frequent use of stents. CABG, with the use of saphenous
vein grafts or internal mammary arteries, is usually reserved
for more complex or longer-segment disease. CABG markers
are usually placed at the anastomotic site to help the angiog-
rapher during future selective angiography. Use of the internal
mammary artery has better long-term results than saphenous
vein grafts and has been correlated with increased survival.
Recurrence of symptoms after CABG may be because of occlu-
sion, graft stenosis, or progression of native vessel disease.
Graft stenoses and acute occlusions may be amenable to per-
cutaneous interventional techniques. Grafts and occasionally
stents can be noninvasively evaluated with CTCA (Fig. 22.6),
although metallic stents can cause imaging problems.

    Echocardiography is useful in detecting some of the long-
term complications of ischemic disease, including ventricular
aneurysm, thinning of myocardium, akinesia, or dyskine-
sia. Aneurysms are best seen at the apex and septum. Mural
thrombi may also be diagnosed but are difficult to visualize
at the apex. Stress echocardiography with either exercise or
pharmacologic stress techniques is increasingly used to evalu-
ate for ischemia.

    CT coronary angiography is capable of establishing the
patency of CABGs. Ultrafast CT (EBCT) and now MDCT
has a 93% sensitivity, 89% specificity, and 92% accuracy for
establishing patency of the CABG grafts. EBCT and MDCT
have also shown to be extremely sensitive for detecting coro-
nary calcification. EBCT and MDCT with contrast can also
evaluate wall motion, thrombi, old infarcts, aneurysm, and
pericardial abnormalities.

    MR can be used (1) to define the location and size of previ-
ous myocardial infarctions, (2) to demonstrate complications
of previous infarctions, (3) to establish the presence of viable
myocardium for possible revascularization, (4) to differenti-
ate acute versus chronic myocardial infarction, (5) to evaluate
regional myocardial wall motion and systolic wall thickening
(Fig. 22.7), (6) to demonstrate global myocardial function
with right ventricular and left ventricular ejection fractions,
(7) to evaluate papillary muscle and valvular abnormalities,
and (8) to evaluate regional myocardial perfusion (Fig. 22.8).

der with "parchment-like thinning" of the RV. More recently,
it has been described as an acquired disorder in infants or
adults and is called "arrhythmogenic right ventricular dys-
plasia" (ARVD). This rare form of cardiomyopathy is limited
to the RV with dilation of the RV chamber, marked thinning
of the anterior right ventricular wall, and abnormal RV wall
motion (Fig. 22.21). MR may also show fatty infiltration of
the anterior RV-free wall (essentially diagnostic), dyskinesia,
and even RV aneurysm. Clinical presentation includes syn-
cope, recurrent ventricular tachycardia, and premature death
from early congestive failure or arrhythmias. Familial occur-
rence has been reported, and males outnumber females by 3:1.
Right ventricular ejection fractions are commonly reduced
to less than half of normal, with mild reductions in the left
ventricular ejection fraction. Treatment involves exercise
restrictions and placement of an implantable cardioverter defi-
brillator (ICD).
