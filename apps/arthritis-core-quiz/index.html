                correctAnswer: "Neurosensory deficit leading to joint destruction",
                explanation: "The text defines neuropathic arthropathy as 'a destructive form of arthritis caused by neurosensory deficit. Lack of sensation ultimately causes severe degenerative changes...'"

                correctAnswer: "Demineralization",

                correctAnswer: "Diabetes Mellitus",
