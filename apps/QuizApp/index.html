                correctAnswer: "Practice of sharing risk",
                explanation: "The text states: 'Insurance is the practice of sharing risk. The classic example is fire insurance...Everybody in town pays a little so that the one person whose house burns down receives a sum of money...'"

                correctAnswer: "Their most valuable asset is their ability to earn a high income over many years.",
                explanation: "The text highlights: 'Your most valuable asset is your ability to work' and protecting the ability 'to turn the knowledge and skills you spent a decade learning into a huge pile of money by working... for decades.'"

                correctAnswer: "An independent agent who can sell policies from multiple companies",
                explanation: "The text advises seeing 'an independent disability insurance agent... By independent, I mean this agent can sell you a policy from dozens of different companies, not just one.' It contrasts this with 'captive' agents."

                correctAnswer: "Your detailed investment portfolio statement",
                explanation: "The text lists needing income proof, spending estimate, info on existing group policies, and copies of those policies. It does not mention needing investment details at this stage."

                correctAnswer: "You control the details and the policy is portable.",

                correctAnswer: "Usually cheaper cost and easier qualification",

                correctAnswer: "Specialty-specific, own occupation",
                explanation: "The text identifies the strongest definition: 'if you cannot work in your chosen occupation (defined as your specialty) that the policy will pay out its full amount. Specialty-specific, own occupation. Those are the words you’re looking for.'"

                correctAnswer: "The policy pays if you cannot do your specific job, even if you can work elsewhere.",

                correctAnswer: "Around 60%",
                explanation: "The text states: 'As a general rule, insurance companies will allow you to buy enough insurance to replace 60 percent of your gross income, up to about $20,000 a month.'"
            },
            {
                question: "Are disability insurance benefits typically taxed if you paid the premiums with after-tax money?",
                options: ["Yes, they are taxed as ordinary income.", "Yes, but at a lower capital gains rate.", "No, they are usually tax-free.", "Only the portion exceeding your premiums is taxed."],
                correctAnswer: "No, they are usually tax-free.",
                explanation: "The text notes: 'Remember that disability insurance benefits, unless the premiums were paid for by your employer, are completely tax-free to you.'"

                options: ["It increases the initial benefit amount based on inflation.", "It ensures the benefit payments increase over time to keep pace with inflation *after* you become disabled.", "It reduces premiums if the cost of living decreases.", "It pays for cost of living expenses separately from the main benefit."],
                correctAnswer: "It ensures the benefit payments increase over time to keep pace with inflation *after* you become disabled.",
                explanation: "The COLA rider 'ensures that your payments will go up with inflation as the years go by... But once it starts paying, it will gradually adjust upward with inflation...'"

                correctAnswer: "When you are young (like a resident) and expect your income to increase significantly.",
                explanation: "The text suggests this rider is smart when the company limits initial purchase, e.g., 'most residents and fellows are limited... So for a resident... it makes sense to buy a future purchase option rider.'"

                question: "What is the author's general opinion on the Catastrophic Disability Rider?",
                options: ["It's essential for everyone.", "It's better to use the premium cost to buy a larger base benefit instead.", "It's only useful for surgeons.", "It replaces the need for a partial disability rider."],
                correctAnswer: "It's better to use the premium cost to buy a larger base benefit instead.",
                explanation: "The author states: 'But as a general rule, I think you are better off using the money the rider would cost to just buy a larger benefit to start with.' Although noting some advisors disagree."

                correctAnswer: "Guaranteed Renewable premiums can increase for your class; Non-Cancelable premiums cannot increase.",
                explanation: "The text explains: 'Under the second [Guaranteed Renewable], the insurance company can raise your rates [for the class]... Finally, with a non-cancelable policy, the insurance company cannot raise rates at all...'"

                correctAnswer: "90 days",
                explanation: "The author recommends: 'I recommend choosing the 90-day period. With a three-month emergency fund, you can easily self-insure those first ninety days... Policies with 30-day waiting periods are too expensive and a policy with a 180-day waiting period does not provide much of a discount...'"

                correctAnswer: "Women are statistically more likely to file a disability claim.",
                explanation: "The text states: 'This is simply due to the fact that women are much more likely to make a claim than men are, partly due to the unique risks of pregnancy.'"

                question: "When does the text recommend is generally the best time to initially purchase disability insurance?",

                correctAnswer: "During the first month or two of residency",
                explanation: "'My general recommendation is to buy your coverage as soon as you get out of school (i.e., your first month or two of residency)... The younger you are, the less expensive and the more valuable the policy is.'"
            },
            {
                question: "Why is buying early (e.g., during residency) potentially advantageous?",

                correctAnswer: "Premiums are lower, you are likely healthier, and you may qualify for discounts.",
                explanation: "Reasons given include: 'The younger you are, the less expensive', 'The younger and healthier, the better', and 'residents are likely to qualify for one or more discounts'."

                correctAnswer: "You become financially independent and no longer need the income protection.",
                explanation: "The text suggests cancelling 'when you no longer need it. If you become financially independent, such that you no longer need to work for money, ever, then cancel your policy.'"

            {
                question: "What is a 'graded premium' policy?",

                correctAnswer: "A policy with lower premiums initially that increase over time.",
                explanation: "'With graded premiums, you pay less now and more later for the same benefit rather than one flat rate over the years.' This can be useful if planning for early financial independence."

                correctAnswer: "Not having any disability insurance at all.",
                explanation: "'The main disability insurance-related issue for doctors is that they do not have it at all, often because they do not feel its purchase is urgent...'"

                question: "What should you do with the actual policy document once you receive it?",

                correctAnswer: "Read every word, have the agent explain it, and take notes.",
                explanation: "The advice is: 'Be sure to read every word in the policy and have your agent explain to you what is meant. Take notes, right in the policy, to remind you later what you were told.'"

                correctAnswer: "They are incentivized to sell larger policies with more riders due to commissions.",
                explanation: "The text cautions: 'Just keep in mind the agent is incentivized to sell you an individual... policy, to sell you the largest policy... and to sell you as many of the bells and whistles as possible.'"

                correctAnswer: "If there are any available discounts (e.g., multi-life).",
                explanation: "'Be sure to ask for a discount. If you buy from an agent who has worked with hundreds of doctors, she should be able to offer you a 'preferred producer multi-life' discount...'"
