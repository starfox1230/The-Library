    {
        question: "Which cranial nerve courses within the cavernous sinus proper, lateral to the internal carotid artery (ICA)?",
        options: ["Oculomotor nerve (CN III)", "Trochlear nerve (CN IV)", "Abducens nerve (CN VI)", "Ophthalmic nerve (CN V1)"],
        correctAnswer: "Abducens nerve (CN VI)",
        explanation: "The abducens nerve (CN VI) and the sympathetic plexus around the ICA lie within the cavity of the cavernous sinus. CN III, IV, and V1 lie within the lateral dural wall. (Page 798)"
    },
    {
        question: "Which dural wall of the cavernous sinus is composed of only a single layer, making it most susceptible to invasion from adjacent structures like pituitary adenomas?",
        options: ["Lateral wall", "Medial wall", "Superior wall (roof)", "Posterior wall"],
        correctAnswer: "Medial wall",
        explanation: "The medial wall is the weakest, consisting of a single dural layer separating the sinus from the pituitary gland and sphenoid sinus. Other walls have two layers. (Page 797-798)"
    },
    {
        question: "The oculomotor nerve (CN III), trochlear nerve (CN IV), and ophthalmic nerve (CN V1) are located within which specific part of the cavernous sinus structure?",
        options: ["The main venous cavity", "The medial dural wall", "The lateral dural wall", "The posterior wall"],
        correctAnswer: "The lateral dural wall",
        explanation: "CN III, IV, and V1 are located within the inner dural layer of the lateral cavernous sinus wall, in superior-to-inferior order. (Page 797-798)"
    },
    {
        question: "The maxillary nerve (CN V2) courses in relation to the cavernous sinus:",

        correctAnswer: "Homogeneous intense enhancement and a potential dural tail",
        explanation: "Meningiomas typically show homogeneous intense enhancement and may have a dural tail sign. Schwannomas are often more heterogeneous and cystic, especially when large. (Page 801)"
    },
    {
        question: "ICA encasement by a cavernous sinus meningioma commonly leads to what finding, often absent with cavernous hemangiomas?",
        options: ["ICA aneurysm formation", "Luminal narrowing of the ICA", "Increased flow velocity in the ICA", "ICA dissection"],
        correctAnswer: "Luminal narrowing of the ICA",
        explanation: "Meningiomas encasing the ICA often cause luminal narrowing (Fig 6a), whereas cavernous hemangiomas typically do not, even when encasing the vessel. (Page 801, 803)"
    },
    {
        question: "A dumbbell-shaped mass extending from the cavernous sinus into the posterior fossa or infratemporal fossa, showing heterogeneous T2 hyperintensity and enhancement, is characteristic of:",
        options: ["Meningioma", "Schwannoma", "Cavernous hemangioma", "Lymphoma"],
        correctAnswer: "Schwannoma",
        explanation: "Schwannomas often assume a dumbbell shape when extending through foramina and typically show heterogeneous T2 signal and enhancement due to Antoni A/B patterns and cystic changes. (Page 801)"
    },
    {
        question: "The 'target sign' on T2-weighted MRI (peripheral hyperintensity, central hypointensity) can be seen in which type of cavernous sinus lesion associated with NF1?",
        options: ["Schwannoma", "Meningioma", "Plexiform neurofibroma", "Optic pathway glioma"],
        correctAnswer: "Plexiform neurofibroma",
        explanation: "The 'target sign' is characteristic of plexiform neurofibromas, which are seen almost exclusively in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). (Page 802)"

        question: "A rare mesenchymal tumor arising from dura, mimicking meningioma but potentially showing bone erosion and prominent flow voids, is:",
        options: ["Schwannoma", "Solitary Fibrous Tumor/Hemangiopericytoma", "Melanoma", "Lymphoma"],
        correctAnswer: "Solitary Fibrous Tumor/Hemangiopericytoma",
        explanation: "SFT/HPC mimics meningioma but clues include a narrow base, adjacent bone erosion (unlike hyperostosis in meningioma), and associated flow voids. (Page 802-803, Fig E2)"
    },
    {
        question: "Progressive, centripetal 'fill-in' enhancement on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI is a characteristic feature of:",
        options: ["Meningioma", "Schwannoma", "Cavernous hemangioma", "Metastasis"],
        correctAnswer: "Cavernous hemangioma",
        explanation: "Cavernous hemangiomas show characteristic progressive 'fill-in' enhancement, starting peripherally or centrally and becoming homogeneously intense on delayed images (Fig 8b, c). (Page 803)"
    },
    {
        question: "Intrinsic T1 hyperintensity and heterogeneous T2 signal (often with hypointense areas) within a cavernous sinus mass should raise suspicion for:",
        options: ["Schwannoma", "Melanoma", "Epidermoid cyst", "Lymphoma"],
        correctAnswer: "Melanoma",
        explanation: "Melanoma demonstrates characteristic T1 hyperintensity due to melanin, with heterogeneous T2 signal (hypointensity from paramagnetic effects). (Page 804, Fig 9)"
    },
    {
        question: "According to the Cottier classification, greater than what percentage of ICA circumference contact by a pituitary adenoma indicates cavernous sinus invasion?",
        options: ["25%", "50%", "67%", "100%"],
        correctAnswer: "67%",
        explanation: "Cottier et al proposed that >67% circumferential contact between the pituitary tumor and the ICA indicates cavernous sinus invasion. (Page 805)"
    },
    {
        question: "An intensely enhancing mass centered in the pterygopalatine fossa, causing anterior bowing of the posterior maxillary sinus wall and extending into the cavernous sinus in an adolescent male, is highly suggestive of:",
        options: ["Schwannoma", "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma", "Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma (JNA)", "Rhabdomyosarcoma"],
        correctAnswer: "Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma (JNA)",
        explanation: "Expansion of the pterygopalatine fossa and anterior bowing of the maxillary sinus wall by an intensely enhancing mass in an adolescent male are classic signs of JNA. (Page 805, Fig 10)"
    },
    {
        question: "A lesion arising from the petro-occipital synchondrosis, showing marked T2 hyperintensity and a 'ring and arc' pattern of calcification on CT, extending into the cavernous sinus is characteristic of:",
        options: ["Chordoma", "Chondrosarcoma", "Meningioma", "Pituitary Adenoma"],
        correctAnswer: "Chondrosarcoma",
        explanation: "Chondrosarcomas often arise off-midline (e.g., petro-occipital synchondrosis), show high T2 signal due to chondroid matrix, and demonstrate characteristic 'ring and arc' calcification on CT. (Page 805-806, Fig 11)"
    },
    {
        question: "A midline, destructive lesion of the clivus demonstrating marked T2 hyperintensity, likely arising from notochordal remnants, is most consistent with:",
        options: ["Chondrosarcoma", "Chordoma", "Sphenoid sinus carcinoma", "Meningioma"],
        correctAnswer: "Chordoma",
        explanation: "Chordomas typically arise in the midline from the clivus, cause lytic bone destruction, and show very high T2 signal intensity due to their high fluid content (physaliferous cells). (Page 806)"
    },
    {
        question: "Which malignancy is known for its propensity for perineural spread along cranial nerves (e.g., V2 or V3) into the cavernous sinus, often presenting as a small primary tumor with extensive nerve involvement?",
        options: ["Nasopharyngeal carcinoma", "Adenoid cystic carcinoma", "Squamous cell carcinoma", "Rhabdomyosarcoma"],
        correctAnswer: "Adenoid cystic carcinoma",
        explanation: "Adenoid cystic carcinoma, typically arising from minor salivary glands, has a marked propensity for perineural spread, which is often best depicted on gadolinium-enhanced fat-suppressed MRI. (Page 807, Fig E5)"
    },
    {
        question: "Adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas, often seen in children, typically show which features that help distinguish them from papillary types seen in adults?",

        correctAnswer: "Cystic components with T1 hyperintensity ('motor oil cysts') and calcification",
        explanation: "Adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas are characterized by calcification and cystic components, which may be T1 hyperintense due to protein/cholesterol ('motor oil cysts'), unlike papillary types which are typically solid and non-calcified. (Page 807-808)"
    },
    {
        question: "A cavernous sinus lesion appearing T2 hypointense, showing diffusion restriction, and demonstrating intense FDG uptake on PET/CT is highly suspicious for:",
        options: ["Sarcoidosis", "Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome", "Lymphoma", "Meningioma"],
        correctAnswer: "Lymphoma",
        explanation: "Lymphoma often appears T2 hypointense due to high cellularity, shows marked diffusion restriction, and is typically FDG-avid on PET. (Page 808, Fig 12)"
    },
     {
        question: "Acute invasive fungal sinusitis extending to the cavernous sinus often occurs in immunocompromised patients. What is the characteristic appearance of the involved, infarcted nasal tissue on MRI?",
        options: ["T2 hyperintense and enhancing", "T2 hypointense and non-enhancing ('black turbinate sign')", "Isointense to muscle on all sequences", "Fat signal intensity"],
        correctAnswer: "T2 hypointense and non-enhancing ('black turbinate sign')",
        explanation: "Infarcted tissue in acute invasive fungal sinusitis characteristically has a nonenhancing T2-hypointense nature, termed the 'black turbinate sign'. (Page 811, Fig 16)"
    },
    {
        question: "Chronic inflammatory conditions like sarcoidosis, IgG4-related disease, or tuberculosis involving the cavernous sinus often show what characteristic signal intensity on T2-weighted images?",
        options: ["Markedly hyperintense", "Isointense to CSF", "Hypointense", "Heterogeneous with cystic changes"],
        correctAnswer: "Hypointense",
        explanation: "Many chronic infective/inflammatory processes involving the cavernous sinus, including fungal infection, TB, sarcoidosis, and IgG4-RD, tend to appear T2-hypointense, likely due to granulomas, fibrosis, or paramagnetic elements. (Page 811, 812, 813, Fig 17, E7, E10, E11)"
    },
    {
        question: "Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is characterized by painful ophthalmoplegia due to nonspecific inflammation. How is the diagnosis typically established?",
        options: ["Specific serologic markers", "Biopsy showing characteristic granulomas", "Diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out other causes, with response to steroids", "Pathognomonic MRI findings"],
        correctAnswer: "Diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out other causes, with response to steroids",
        explanation: "Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion. Imaging shows enhancing soft tissue but is nonspecific. Biopsy is usually not performed, and diagnosis relies on clinical criteria, ruling out mimics, and response to corticosteroids. (Page 813)"
    },
    {
        question: "Which congenital cyst is characterized by signal intensity following CSF on all sequences (including FLAIR suppression), lack of enhancement, AND restricted diffusion?",
        options: ["Arachnoid cyst", "Epidermoid cyst", "Dermoid cyst", "CSF pseudocyst"],
        correctAnswer: "Epidermoid cyst",
        explanation: "Epidermoid cysts typically follow CSF signal but show incomplete FLAIR suppression and characteristic diffusion restriction, distinguishing them from arachnoid cysts. They do not enhance. (Page 814, Fig 18)"
    },
     {
        question: "A congenital cyst demonstrating T1 hyperintensity (similar to fat) and variable T2 signal, potentially with thin peripheral enhancement, located in the parasellar region is suggestive of:",
        options: ["Epidermoid cyst", "Dermoid cyst", "Arachnoid cyst", "Lipoma"],
        correctAnswer: "Dermoid cyst",
        explanation: "Dermoid cysts contain dermal elements and cholesterol, resulting in T1 hyperintensity similar to fat. T2 signal is variable, and thin peripheral enhancement may occur. (Page 814)"
    },
    {
        question: "What is a potential pitfall when interpreting contrast-enhanced CT or MRI of the cavernous sinuses, especially on early-phase imaging?",
        options: ["Overestimation of enhancement in inflammatory lesions", "Mistaking normal intrasinus fat for a non-enhancing lesion", "Apparent lack of enhancement or filling defects due to delayed venous filling compared to arteries", "Difficulty distinguishing CN VI from the ICA"],
        correctAnswer: "Apparent lack of enhancement or filling defects due to delayed venous filling compared to arteries",
        explanation: "The cavernous sinuses opacify later than arteries and other dural sinuses. First-pass or insufficiently delayed contrast-enhanced images can show incomplete opacification, mimicking filling defects or thrombosis. Delayed phase imaging (>45s for CT) is crucial. (Page 816, Fig E14)"
    },
    {
