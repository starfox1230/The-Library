00:00:03.400 The book of Acts.
00:00:04.573 In the first video wewatched Luke open the book
00:00:06.993 by showing us how theRisen Jesus was exalted
00:00:09.533 as the King of the world.
00:00:10.913 He promised to send the Holy Spirit
00:00:12.676 as His own personal presence
00:00:14.346 to empower His followers,
00:00:16.015 to go out into the world
00:00:17.586 and bear witness to thegood news about His Kingdom,
00:00:20.996 until he would return one day.
00:00:22.886 And so the movement beganin Jerusalem as the Spirit
00:00:26.066 came and formed Jesus'followers into the new temple
00:00:28.926 promised by the scriptural prophets.
00:00:31.176 But this generated conflictwith the leaders of Jerusalem.
00:00:34.036 And so it led to thepersecution of the Christians.
00:00:36.456 but the Spirit transformed it into good:
00:00:38.766 it actually became the means
00:00:40.416 by which the originally Jewish Jesus' communities
00:00:43.656 were pushed outside Jerusalem
00:00:45.666 to become a multi-ethnic,international movement.
00:00:49.106 And the flagship Church of thisdiverse Jesus' movement was in Antioch,
00:00:53.426 the largest city in thatpart of the Roman Empire.
00:00:56.006 So we left the storywith Barnabas and Paul
00:00:58.246 serving in Antioch church.
00:01:00.327 And the Spirit prompts the church
00:01:01.707 to send them on a missionary journey,
00:01:04.107 which opens up a wholenew section of the book,
00:01:06.247 the stories about Paul and his co-workers
00:01:08.157 traveling to different citiesaround the Roman Empire
00:01:10.767 announcing the goodnews that Jesus is King.
00:01:14.167 The first mission is into the interior
00:01:16.467 of what's called Asia Minorfound in modern Turkey.
00:01:19.683 And it ends with an importantmeeting of the Apostles back in Jerusalem.
00:01:23.661 The second mission is through Asia Minor
00:01:25.571 and then into ancient Greece.
00:01:27.271 And then the third mission isthrough that same territory again
00:01:30.633 and it concludes with Paul'sjourney all the way back to Jerusalem.
00:01:34.684 Now in recounting all these stories
00:01:36.634 Luke has highlighted anumber of important themes
00:01:39.494 by repeating them.
00:01:40.963 So first is thecontinued mission to Israel;
00:01:43.283 whenever Paul enters a new city
00:01:44.803 he always goes firstto the Jewish synagogue
00:01:47.623 to share about the risen King Jesus
00:01:49.533 and how He's forming anew multi-ethnic family of God.
00:01:53.603 The most often lots of people cometo recognize Jesus as the Messiah
00:01:57.744 but some oppose Paul.
00:01:59.554 Sometimes they even throw himout of town as a dangerous rebel
00:02:03.054 who opposes theTorah and Jewish tradition.
00:02:05.664 And this tensionculminates after the first journey
00:02:08.184 leading to animportant council in Jerusalem.
00:02:10.954 So Paul discovers that thereare some Jewish Christians in Antioch
00:02:15.304 and they're claimingthat unless non-Jewish people
00:02:17.914 become Jewish bypracticing circumcision, the Sabbath,
00:02:21.534 obeying the kosher food laws,
00:02:23.184 that they can'tbecome part of Jesus' family.
00:02:26.134 But Paul and Barnabasthey radically disagree.
00:02:29.350 And so they take the debate toa Leadership Council in Jerusalem.
00:02:33.018 Now there Peter, Paul, and James, the brother of Jesus
00:02:36.298 they all show from theScriptures and from their experience
00:02:39.848 that God's plan was always to includethe nations within His covenant people.
00:02:44.776 So they write a letterrequiring non-Jewish Christians
00:02:47.536 to stop participating inpagan temple sacrifices
00:02:50.921 but they don't require them toadopt an ethnically Jewish identity
00:02:54.911 or obey the laws in the Torah.
00:02:57.289 Now this decision was groundbreakingfor the history of the Jesus' Movement.
00:03:01.914 Jesus is the Jewish Messiah
00:03:04.194 but He's also therisen King of all nations.
00:03:06.834 And so once membership among Hispeople is not based on ethnic identity
00:03:11.554 or following the laws of the Torah;
00:03:13.484 it's based simply on trusting Jesus
00:03:16.264 and then following His teachings.
00:03:18.164 And it's this multi-ethnicreality of the Jesus' Movement
00:03:22.024 that leads us to the next theme
00:03:23.694 Luke wants us to see in themissionary journeys, namely:
00:03:26.624 the clash of culturesbetween the early Christians
00:03:29.644 and the greek and roman world.
00:03:31.552 Luke records multiple clashes in Philippi, Athens, Ephesus.
00:03:35.732 Paul goes and announces Jesus
00:03:37.762 as the revelation of the one true God
00:03:39.772 and as the King of the world
00:03:41.412 who shows up all other godsand idols as powerless and futile.
00:03:46.146 And his message is consistently viewed
00:03:48.366 as subversive to the Roman Way of life
00:03:50.976 and he gets accused of beinga dangerous social revolutionary.
00:03:55.353 These stories show how the multi- ethnic, monotheistic Jesus' communities
00:04:00.153 did not fit into any culturalboxes known to the Roman people.
00:04:04.493 The ancient world had justnever seen anything like them.
00:04:07.673 And the Christians arousedmore than just suspicions.
00:04:10.413 Another theme Luke repeats is
00:04:12.123 how Paul and the Christians
00:04:13.893 are constantly being accused of rebellion
00:04:16.262 even treason againstCaesar, the Roman Emperor.
00:04:19.033 People heard Paul correctly:
00:04:20.933 he was announcingthat there's another King Jesus
00:04:24.428 and they also correctly saw that theChristian Way of life was the challenge
00:04:28.338 to many Roman cultural values.
00:04:30.278 But every time Paul gets arrestedand interrogated before Roman officials
00:04:34.918 they don't see anythreat and he's dismissed.
00:04:37.693 These stories show us the paradox
00:04:39.593 that the early churchpresented to the world;
00:04:42.233 it was a Jewish messianic movement
00:04:44.713 but it was ethnicallydiverse, full of communities
00:04:47.383 that treated men and women
00:04:48.893 and rich and poor and slave and free,
00:04:50.943 all as equals.
00:04:52.738 And they all gave theirallegiance to King Jesus alone
00:04:56.028 and no other god or king.
00:04:57.928 And so their very existence
00:04:59.538 it turned upside down thecore values of roman culture
00:05:02.838 but the Christians pose no military threat
00:05:05.648 because Jesus taughtthem to be people of peace.
00:05:08.411 And so the only crime Paul andthe Christians can be accused of
00:05:12.381 is not conforming to the status quo.
00:05:15.270 The books final sectionreturns the focus to Paul's witness
00:05:18.440 spreading from Jerusalem to Rome.
00:05:20.644 His final missionaryjourney ends back in Jerusalem
00:05:23.804 where his controversialreputation precedes him.
00:05:26.424 He gets attacked byJewish people who think
00:05:28.974 that he's betrayed Israel whichattracts the attention of Roman soldiers
00:05:32.844 who think Paul's a terroristfrom Egypt starting a rebellion.
00:05:36.067 And so he gets arrested.
00:05:37.377 From here Paul is put on trial:
00:05:39.317 first before the Jewish leadersof the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem
00:05:42.464 but then before a seriesof Roman leaders in Caesarea.
00:05:45.814 There's governor Felix
00:05:47.139 who puts Paul off forthe next governor Festus
00:05:49.739 who eventually bringsPaul before King Agrippa.
00:05:52.773 He ends up in prison for years
00:05:54.793 even though at each trialthe charges never stick to him
00:05:58.733 because all he's doing is announcing
00:06:00.873 that his hope in the resurrectionhas been fulfilled in King Jesus.
00:06:04.673 This is hardly a crime.
00:06:06.243 But at this point the Roman legalmachine can't just turn him away
00:06:09.833 and so Paul ends upappealing to Rome's highest court.
00:06:14.003 Now you would think that all thisprison time would be a setback for Paul
00:06:17.763 because his heartbeat is to be on theroad starting new Jesus' communities.
00:06:21.997 But the Spirit orchestrateseverything for good in this book.
00:06:25.507 And so the imprisonment gives Paul time
00:06:27.827 to have his mostimportant apostolic letters written.
00:06:31.467 And these become the way
00:06:32.967 that his missionary legacy iscarried on long after he dies.
00:06:37.149 Eventually Paul wastransferred as a prisoner to Rome
00:06:40.169 and after a terrifying near-deathvoyage across the Mediterranean,
00:06:44.309 Paul ends up in house arrest in Rome
00:06:46.969 awaiting his delayed trial.
00:06:49.030 And so he's able to host inquite a nice house regular meetings
00:06:52.930 that reach Jews and Gentiles.
00:06:54.730 And the books final words are about
00:06:56.320 how Paul is announcing the Kingdom of God
00:06:58.900 and boldly teaching all aboutthe Lord Jesus, the Messiah
00:07:03.070 totally unhindered;
00:07:04.705 all happening rightunder Caesar's nose in Rome.
00:07:08.465 The unified work of Lukeacts it does so much more
00:07:11.945 than give us a historyof Jesus and the early church.
00:07:14.925 He's showing how the Kingdomof God came on earth as in heaven
00:07:19.445 through Jesus' life,death and resurrection;
00:07:22.115 through the coming of His Spirit
00:07:23.895 to empower the church tobear witness from Jerusalem
00:07:27.695 to the ends of the Earth.
00:07:29.434 And as Luke has told the storyhe's given us scores of example
00:07:33.114 of what faithfulnessto King Jesus looks like.
00:07:36.679 It looks like sharing the good news
00:07:38.479 of the risen King Jesusin word and in action.
00:07:42.029 It means formingdiverse Jesus' communities
00:07:44.369 where people of all kinds come together,
00:07:46.759 where they're treated equally
00:07:48.649 and give allegiance to King Jesus
00:07:50.669 and live by His teachings.
00:07:52.227 And all of this is doneby trusting in the power
00:07:56.067 and the guidance of the Spirit
00:07:57.917 to lead the way forward.
00:07:59.991 That's what thebook of Acts is all about.
