00:00:02.580 Paul's letter to the Colossians.
00:00:06.029 It was written during one of Paul the apostle's many imprisonments for announcing Jesus as the risen Lord.
00:00:11.440 The letter is addressed to a group of people that Paul had never met
00:00:15.160 who made up a church community that he did not start.
00:00:18.480 This church in Colossae was started by a co-worker of Paul's named Epaphras who was actually from that city.
00:00:24.540 Epaphras had recently visited Paul in prison and he updated him on how well the Colossians were doing overall.
00:00:31.280 But he also mentioned some of the cultural pressures tempting them to turn away from Jesus.
00:00:36.120 So Paul wrote this letter to encourage the Colossians to address the issues that Epaphras had raised
00:00:41.800 and then to challenge them to a greater devotion to Jesus.
00:00:45.340 The letter's design and flow of thought are pretty easy to follow.
00:00:48.659 The opening movement focuses on Jesus as the exalted Messiah.
00:00:52.220 Paul then goes on to show how his suffering in prison is for the exalted Jesus.
00:00:56.708 Then he addresses the pressures tempting the Colossians to turn away from Jesus.
00:01:01.742 After this he explores the new way of life that Jesus's resurrection opened up for them.
00:01:07.580 The letter opens with two prayers.
00:01:10.000 Paul first thanks God that he learned from Epaphras that the Colossians have been totally faithful to Jesus,
00:01:16.080 showing love for God and their neighbors all because of the hope they have in the new creation that Jesus has in store.
00:01:22.980 He moves on to pray that they would grow in their wisdom and understanding about Jesus.
00:01:28.200 Then Paul has placed a poem here to help the Colossians and us do exactly that.
00:01:33.760 It is the centerpiece of chapter 1, a poem all about the crucified and exalted Messiah.
00:01:39.060 It has two parallel stanzas.
00:01:41.480 It is crammed with language and imagery from the books of Genesis and Exodus, from the Psalms and the Proverbs.
00:01:47.800 The first stanza explores how Jesus is the true image of God.
00:01:51.740 In him the full character and purpose of God is embodied in a human.
00:01:56.160 He is the firstborn, an Old Testament phrase about Jesus' royal status over all creation.
00:02:02.028 He shares in the very identity of the one true creator God.
00:02:06.640 By him, all reality, all powers and authorities, spiritual and human, have been created.
00:02:13.500 It is in Jesus the Messiah that we discover the very author and king of creation.
00:02:19.120 In the second stanza we discover he is also the one bringing about a new creation.
00:02:24.320 He is the head of a new body, which refers to Jesus' people
00:02:28.542 who were the new humanity of which his own resurrection existence is a prototype.
00:02:34.339 In him, God's glorious temple presence dwells.
00:02:38.400 So, it is through Jesus's death and resurrection that God has reconciled himself to humanity,
00:02:43.770 to all spiritual powers, to all of creation.
00:02:47.520 It is a remarkable poem and Paul will keep referring back to it as he goes on in the letter.
00:02:52.320 He first shows how the truth of this poem transforms his own experience of suffering in prison.
00:02:57.630 He is being punished for announcing to the Greek and the Roman world that Jesus is the resurrected Lord and king of all.
00:03:04.020 So his suffering, he thinks, is not a sign of defeat.
00:03:07.340 It is actually his way of participating in Jesus's own suffering, done as an act of love.
00:03:13.280 So his hardships are actually a cause for joy.
00:03:16.220 He is imprisoned for the surprising news that Israel's resurrected Messiah is creating a new multi-ethnic family.
00:03:23.549 And more: just as the divine glory dwelt in Jesus, so Jesus dwells in and among his international family.
00:03:31.520 Or, as Paul says, the Messiah is in you all, the hope of glory.
00:03:35.740 Paul then addresses the cultural pressures that are tempting the Colossians to turn away from Jesus.
00:03:41.500 They were confronted by a combination of mystical polytheism along with
00:03:45.900 a pressure to observe the laws of the Torah.
00:03:48.440 So, all these new Christians had grown up worshipping the various Greek and Roman gods who govern different arenas of human life.
00:03:55.980 Many simply included Jesus as one more deity that they could worship.
00:04:00.260 There was also a great pressure from the Jewish Christian community
00:04:03.520 for these non-Jews to complete their commitment to the Messiah by following all of the laws found in the Torah.
00:04:10.820 Specifically, he mentions eating a kosher diet, observing sacred days and circumcision.
00:04:16.180 It is very similar to the problem he addressed in the letter to the Galatians.
00:04:19.839 For Paul, to give in to either of these temptations is compromised.
00:04:24.100 It is a failure to grasp who Jesus really is and what he did on their behalf.
00:04:29.300 The Colossians used to live in fear of spiritual powers and elemental spirits,
00:04:33.990 as Paul calls them, but Jesus triumphed over these through his death and resurrection.
00:04:39.340 He freed the Colossians from any obligation to them.
00:04:42.480 In the same way, Jesus fulfilled on our behalf all of the laws of the Torah,
00:04:47.420 which never had the power to transform the selfish human heart anyway.
00:04:51.200 So, what Jesus did in his life and death and resurrection lacks nothing.
00:04:56.360 It doesn't need to be supplemented by following the laws.
00:04:59.800 He is the reality to which all of the laws of the Torah were pointing anyway.
00:05:04.320 Instead of the laws, followers of Jesus have the power of his resurrection to change them,
00:05:09.820 which is what he goes on to explore.
00:05:12.140 Following Jesus means joining his new humanity because their lives have now been joined to the risen Jesus' life.
00:05:20.040 This is why Paul challenges the Colossians to set their minds on things above, where the Messiah is seated, or rules, at God's right hand.
00:05:29.308 Now Paul does not mean here, think about how you will one day leave Earth and go to heaven.
00:05:33.940 Rather, the heavens are the transcendent place from which Jesus rules now over all of creation.
00:05:40.620 From there, he will one day return here to transform all things,
00:05:45.100 or, as Paul says, when the Messiah who is your life is revealed, you too will be revealed with him in glory.
00:05:53.000 So, Paul challenges them to live in the present as the kinds of new humans they will one day become.
00:05:59.360 He uses the image of their old humanity characterized by distorted sexuality and destructive speech.
00:06:05.980 For Christians, that humanity died with Jesus and has been replaced by his own new humanity,
00:06:12.540 which is characterized by mercy and generosity, by forgiveness and love.
00:06:16.918 This humanity transcends the ethnic and social boundary lines of our world to create, in Paul's words,
00:06:24.060 a people where there is no one Greek or Jewish, circumcised or uncircumcised, slave or free,
00:06:31.280 but the Messiah is all and is in all people.
00:06:35.300 Paul then gets really practical.
00:06:37.148 He shows the Colossians what this new humanity might look like in a first century Roman household,
00:06:42.750 which was a highly authoritarian institution where the male patriarch held the power of life and death
00:06:48.920 over his wife, children and slaves.
00:06:51.640 Not so in a Christian household.
00:06:54.240 Here the risen Jesus is the true Lord.
00:06:57.100 So in the Lord, the wife allows her husband to become responsible for her.
00:07:03.270 And the husband is subject to Jesus by loving his wife and placing her well-being above his own.
00:07:08.740 In a home where Jesus is Lord, children are not objects but are called to maturity and to respect.
00:07:15.060 Parents are to raise their children with patience and understanding.
00:07:18.850 Christians who are slaves are to honor their human masters precisely because they are not the real master. Jesus is.
00:07:25.980 And Christians who have slaves are to understand that this slave is not their property,
00:07:31.460 But rather, a fellow member of Jesus's body to be honored and embraced in love.
00:07:36.660 Paul is walking a very fine line here.
00:07:39.150 He is reshaping the most basic Roman institution around Jesus, who rules by his self-giving love.
00:07:45.940 So while he does not abolish the household structure outright,
00:07:49.320 the exalted Messiah demands that it be transformed
00:07:52.459 almost beyond the point of recognition for any Roman living in Colossae.
00:07:56.980 You can see this most clearly in the letter's conclusion.
00:07:59.610 After a request for prayer, Paul applies these instructions about Christian slaves and masters.
00:08:05.460 We discover that Tikecus is the one carrying and reading this letter to the Colossians.
00:08:10.580 He is accompanied by a certain Onesimus who was a former slave to a Colossian Christian named Philemon.
00:08:17.600 We discover from another letter addressed to Philemon that Onesimus had escaped from his master.
00:08:23.560 It was a crime worthy of imprisonment.
00:08:25.920 But Paul asks the whole church to greet Onesimus as a faithful and beloved brother in the Lord.
00:08:33.100 In the letter to Philemon, Paul says that he should receive Onesimus no longer as a slave, but as a brother.
00:08:40.260 Talk about ending the letter with a punch!
00:08:43.039 So, in the letter to the Colossians, Paul is inviting us to see that no part of human existence
00:08:48.440 remains untouched by the loving and liberating rule of the risen Jesus.
00:08:53.100 Our suffering, our temptation to compromise, our moral character, the power dynamics in our homes,
00:08:59.540 all of it must be re-examined and transformed.
00:09:02.980 We are invited to live in the present as if the new creation really arrived when Jesus rose from the dead.
00:09:10.520 And that is what the letter to the Colossians is all about.
