00:00:03.575 Paul's letter to the Romans
00:00:05.135 it's one of the longestand most significant things
00:00:07.165 ever written by the man who wasformerly known as Saul of Tarsus.
00:00:11.262 He was a Jewish rabbi belongingto a group known as the Pharisees
00:00:14.552 and he was passionate anddevout to the Torah of Moses
00:00:17.832 and the traditions of Israel.
00:00:19.512 And he saw Jesus andHis followers as a threat.
00:00:22.927 But then he had a radicalencounter with the risen Jesus
00:00:26.127 who commissioned him as an apostle,
00:00:27.967 like official representative
00:00:29.597 to the world of non-jewish people
00:00:31.617 called Gentiles In the Bible.
00:00:33.407 And so we started goingby his Roman name Paul.
00:00:35.937 And he traveled all aroundthe ancient Roman Empire
00:00:38.557 telling peopleabout the risen King Jesus.
00:00:41.422 And forming His followers then
00:00:42.852 into these newcommunities called churches.
00:00:45.412 And Paul occasionaly writeletters to these new Jesus communities
00:00:48.682 to help them foster theirfaith or answer questions;
00:00:51.492 and the book of Romans is one of these.
00:00:53.570 It was actually writtenquite late in his career.
00:00:56.136 Now we know from the book of acts
00:00:57.556 that the church in Romehad existed for some time,
00:01:00.656 that it was made up of Jewishand non-jewish followers of Jesus.
00:01:04.084 But at one point theRoman Emperor Claudius
00:01:06.294 had expelled all of theJewish people from Rome.
00:01:09.166 And then about fiveyears later all of those Jews
00:01:12.176 including Jesus followingJews were allowed to return.
00:01:15.637 And when they did they found a church
00:01:17.577 that had become verynon-jewish in custom and practice
00:01:21.337 and so this created lots of tension,
00:01:23.147 so that by Paul's day theRoman Church was divided.
00:01:27.003 People disagreedabout how to follow Jesus,
00:01:29.433 they were debating aboutwhether non-Jewish Christians
00:01:31.723 should celebrate the Sabbath
00:01:33.043 or eat cosher or be circumsized.
00:01:35.317 And so Paul wrote thisletter to accomplish a few things.
00:01:37.941 He wanted this dividedchurch to become unified.
00:01:41.317 And for a practical purpose he was hoping
00:01:43.797 that the Roman Churchcould become a staging ground
00:01:46.777 for his mission to go evenfurther west all the way to Spain.
00:01:50.710 And so these circumstancesare what motivated Paul
00:01:53.160 to write out his fullestexplanation of the gospel
00:01:56.740 the good news that he was announcing
00:01:58.470 about Jesus's life,death and resurrection.
00:02:01.692 Now the letter is designedto have four main movements
00:02:04.592 but its unified as one longflowing exploration of the gospel.
00:02:09.669 The gospel, Paul says, first ofall reveals God's righteousness.
00:02:13.340 And then it also creates a new humanity
00:02:16.140 which fulfills God's promise to Israel.
00:02:19.423 And so it's this gospelthat's going to unify the church.
00:02:23.281 In this video we're just going to explore
00:02:25.021 the ideas in chapters one through four.
00:02:27.463 So Paul opens byintroducing himself as an apostle
00:02:30.303 appointed by God tospread the gospel about Jesus;
00:02:33.513 how he's the Messiah of Israel
00:02:35.483 who was raised from the dead
00:02:36.943 as the Son of God, King of the nations.
00:02:39.488 And Jesus now calls all humanity
00:02:41.908 to come under His loving rule.
00:02:44.312 And Paul says this goodnews about King Jesus is
00:02:47.212 first of all God's power tosave people who trust in Him.
00:02:50.967 And second that itreveals God's righteousness.
00:02:54.528 Now, righteousness is a richOld Testament word for Paul;
00:02:58.178 it describes God's character
00:03:00.198 that He always does justicewhat is right and what is good
00:03:03.478 but also that He is faithfuland just to fulfill His promises.
00:03:07.482 And Paul sayingthat the story of Jesus shows
00:03:09.882 how God has done both of these things.
00:03:12.416 How?
00:03:13.437 We goes first intoa long creative retelling
00:03:16.167 of Genesis chapters 3 through 11.
00:03:18.423 He shows how all theGentile world all the nations
00:03:21.513 have become trapped in thespiral of sin and selfishness;
00:03:24.923 the human heart andmind are broken Paul says.
00:03:28.084 We've turned away fromGod to mbrace idolatry,
00:03:31.364 which means finding ultimatesignificance in created things
00:03:34.984 and then giving ultimate allegiance
00:03:36.724 to these things that are not God.
00:03:39.119 This results in a distortion of ourhumanity and destructive behavior.
00:03:43.490 And so what's left is a humanity
00:03:45.310 that stands guilty as charged
00:03:47.814 before a just and righteous God
00:03:50.034 to which the people of Israel might say:
00:03:51.916 well it's a good thing then
00:03:53.346 that God chose our peopleout from among the nations,
00:03:56.236 He saved us out of slavery in Egypt,
00:03:58.506 He gave us the laws of the Torah
00:04:00.146 like the Sabbath andeating kosher and circumcision;
00:04:03.036 and these altogether show ushow to live as God's holy people.
00:04:07.415 But Paul says not so fast;
00:04:09.845 he recalls the storyline of the Torah
00:04:12.255 and of the rest of the Old Testament
00:04:14.125 which shows that Israelwas just a sinful and idolatrous
00:04:17.605 and morally brokenas the rest of humanity.
00:04:20.466 Israel is actually more guiltythan the Gentiles, Paul says,
00:04:24.067 because they have theTorah they should know better.
00:04:27.176 And so Paul concludes:
00:04:28.946 all humanity Gentiles, Israelites
00:04:31.796 are hopelessly trappedand guilty before God.
00:04:34.870 But... that is not the final word.
00:04:37.572 The good news aboutJesus is God's response.
00:04:40.492 Instead of holding humanity guilty
00:04:42.664 Jesus came as Israel's Messiah
00:04:44.974 to die on behalf of allpeople as a sacrifice for sins,
00:04:49.189 As our representativeJesus took into himself
00:04:52.529 all of the just consequences ofthe pain, the sin and the death
00:04:57.039 that we have caused in the world.
00:04:59.102 And He overcame it all byHis resurrection from the dead;
00:05:02.572 it's His new resurrection life
00:05:04.812 that he makes available to others.
00:05:07.203 Jesus became what we are
00:05:09.293 so that we might become what He is.
00:05:12.129 And all of this Paul saysis how God justifies those
00:05:15.739 who trust or have faith in Jesus.
00:05:18.465 Now justification is anotherrich Old Testament term for Paul
00:05:22.105 and it's related to God's righteousness.
00:05:24.305 It literally means to declare righteous.
00:05:27.300 Because of what Jesus did on our behalf
00:05:30.040 we are given a new status before God:
00:05:32.690 instead of finding us guilty
00:05:34.220 God declares that a person is in a rightrelationship with Him and is forgiven.
00:05:38.720 Justification results in a new family:
00:05:40.890 the person who trust in Jesus is given a place among God's covenant people.
00:05:45.654 Justification also results in a new future
00:05:48.884 which begins a journey oflife transformation by God's grace.
00:05:53.112 And so all of these thingsabout justification are God's gift
00:05:57.312 to those who throughtheir faith are in Christ.
00:06:01.428 And so this leads Paul in chapter4 to explore the huge implications
00:06:05.248 that all of this has
00:06:06.458 for who can be a partof God's covenant family.
00:06:09.905 He goes back to the story ofAbraham in Genesis chapter 15:
00:06:13.315 before any of the laws ofthe Torah were given to Israel
00:06:16.869 Abraham was justified ordeclared righteous before God.
00:06:20.942 How?
00:06:21.922 Will God promisedthat Abraham would become a father
00:06:24.521 of a large multi-ethnic family
00:06:26.571 that would receive God's blessing.
00:06:28.963 But he and his wifeSarah they were really old
00:06:31.603 and they had neverbeen able to have children.
00:06:33.955 But nonetheless Abraham had radical faith
00:06:36.715 and trust in God's promise.
00:06:38.903 And so God declared him to be righteous.
00:06:41.227 And so Paul says now Abraham has becomethe father of God's new covenant family
00:06:45.727 and it's spreading all around the world.
00:06:48.043 It's made up of Jews and Gentiles
00:06:50.313 who have the same kindof faith and trust in the One
00:06:53.763 who fulfilled God's promise to Abraham,
00:06:56.203 Jesus the Messiah.
00:06:57.993 So let's pause and summarize
00:06:59.463 Paul's main ideas herein chapters 1 through 4
00:07:01.883 because they're the foundation forunderstanding the rest of the letter.
00:07:05.611 All humanity is hopelessly trapped in sin
00:07:08.281 and needs to be rescued.
00:07:10.337 That rescue however is not going to happen
00:07:12.527 by people trying toobey the laws of the Torah.
00:07:15.297 Rather God's righteouscharacter has moved him
00:07:18.597 to rescue the world throughJesus' death and resurrection.
00:07:22.416 So that He could create thatmulti-ethnic family of Abraham
00:07:26.876 based on faith as Hisown new covenant people.
00:07:30.656 And so Paul is going to go on to show
00:07:32.336 how this new family is a partof something much much bigger
00:07:35.836 that caused them to awhole new way of life together.
00:07:39.182 But it's all going to berooted in these core ideas
00:07:41.782 explored in chapters one through four
00:07:44.021 of Paul's letter to the Romans.
