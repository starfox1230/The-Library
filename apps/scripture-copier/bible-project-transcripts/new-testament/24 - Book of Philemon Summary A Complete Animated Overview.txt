00:00:03.080 Paul's letter to Philemon
00:00:05.040 It was written during one of Paul's many imprisonments.
00:00:07.820 It is actually his shortest letter in the New Testament but don't let its size trick you.
00:00:12.540 It is actually one of the most explosive things that Paul ever wrote.
00:00:16.120 Here is the backstory that we can piece together from details within the letter.
00:00:20.300 Philemon was a well-to-do Roman citizen from Colossae who, likely, met Paul during his mission in Ephesus.
00:00:27.060 And he became a follower of Jesus.
00:00:29.120 Then later, when Paul's coworker Epaphras started a Jesus community in Colossae, Philemon became a leader of a church that met in his house.
00:00:38.020 Now, Philemon, like all household patriarchs in the Roman world, owned slaves, one of whom was named Onesimus.
00:00:45.670 At some point, these two had a serious conflict.
00:00:48.480 Onesimus wronged Philemon in some way.
00:00:51.580 Maybe it was theft or maybe he cheated him. We do not exactly know.
00:00:55.210 But afterwards, Onesimus ran away.
00:00:57.707 Eventually Onesimus came to Paul in prison, likely to appeal for help.
00:01:02.400 In the process, he became a follower of Jesus and then a beloved assistant of Paul.
00:01:07.420 So Paul finds himself in a very difficult and delicate situation as he writes this letter.
00:01:13.280 He is going to ask Philemon not just to forgive Onesimus and receive him back
00:01:17.940 but to embrace him as a brother in the Messiah and no longer as a slave.
00:01:23.220 Here is how he does it.
00:01:25.300 Paul opens with a prayer first praising Philemon and thanking God for the love and faithfulness he has shown to Jesus and to his people.
00:01:32.700 He then paves the way for his request with this line,
00:01:36.380 "I pray that the partnership that springs from your faith
00:01:40.260 may effectively lead you to recognize all the good things that work in us leading us into the messiah."
00:01:46.880 A key word here is "partnership" or, in Greek, "koinonia."
00:01:50.920 It means "sharing" or "mutual participation".
00:01:54.220 It is when two or more people receive something together and share in it, becoming partners.
00:02:00.560 Paul says that faithfulness to Jesus means recognizing that all of his followers are equal partners
00:02:07.932 who share together in the gift of God's love and grace.
00:02:11.760 For Paul, this experience of koinonia among Jesus' followers is not just an idea that you think about.
00:02:18.980 It is something that you do in your relationships, which moves Paul onto his request.
00:02:24.160 He finally brings up Onesimus.
00:02:26.709 He says that he's become Paul's "child" in prison,
00:02:29.770 meaning that Paul led Onesimus to dedicate his life and allegiance to Jesus.
00:02:34.320 So Paul and Onesimus are now family members in the Messiah.
00:02:38.280 He has been serving Paul faithfully in prison.
00:02:40.600 Even though Paul wants to keep him around,
00:02:43.180 he knows this unresolved conflict with Philemon has to be reconciled if they say that they are followers of Jesus,
00:02:50.560 which moves Paul onto his bold request:
00:02:52.780 that Philemon receive Onesimus back, no longer as a slave
00:02:57.060 but as more than a slave, as a beloved brother in the Lord.
00:03:01.420 This is a really tall order.
00:03:03.860 Under Roman law, Philemon had every legal right to have Onesimus punished or put in prison.
00:03:09.780 Paul is not only asking him to forgive Onesimus
00:03:12.860 but to welcome back his former slave into Colossae as a social equal, as a family member.
00:03:19.300 This is way more than kindness.
00:03:21.380 This is unheard of.
00:03:23.020 It is freeing a slave and then treating them like a family member.
00:03:26.928 It upsets the status quo of the Roman social order.
00:03:30.489 Why should Philemon do such a thing?
00:03:33.010 Here, Paul pulls a brilliant move.
00:03:35.580 He recalls that keyword from the opening prayer.
00:03:38.120 He says, if you are truly a partner with me...
00:03:41.300 It's that Greek word "koinonia" again,
00:03:43.820 then welcome Onesimus as if he were me.
00:03:47.180 If he has wronged you or owes you anything, charge it to me and I will repay it.
00:03:52.540 In this request we see the heart of Paul's gospel message being acted out.
00:03:57.960 First of all, it is about reconciliation.
00:04:00.280 It is just like he told the Corinthians,
00:04:02.200 "In the Messiah, God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting people's sins against them."
00:04:08.680 In this situation, Paul is putting himself in the place of Jesus.
00:04:12.860 He will absorb the consequences of Onesimus' wrongdoing.
00:04:16.860 He will pay the costs so that he can be reconciled to Philemon.
00:04:21.500 But Paul's message was about more than just a legal transaction.
00:04:25.160 It is also about koinonia.
00:04:27.600 Onesimus and Philemon and Paul are all equals before God.
00:04:32.880 They all share the same need for forgiveness.
00:04:36.340 The ground is level before the cross
00:04:38.800 which means that Philemon and Onesimus can no longer relate to each other as master and slave.
00:04:44.900 They are family members.
00:04:46.500 They are brothers in the Messiah.
00:04:48.780 As Paul told Philemon and the whole church of Colossae,
00:04:52.740 in God's new family people are not Greek or Jewish or circumcised or uncircumcised
00:04:58.840 or foreigners or uncivilized or slave or free.
00:05:02.740 But the Messiah is all and is in all people.
00:05:07.100 Paul closes the letter stating his confidence that Philemon will do even more than Paul has requested.
00:05:12.380 He asks him to prepare a guest room because he wants to visit as soon as he gets out of prison.
00:05:17.420 Then, with some final greetings, Paul ends the letter.
00:05:20.940 Paul's letter to Philemon is powerful for many reasons.
00:05:24.120 It is the only letter where Paul does not explicitly mention Jesus' death or resurrection.
00:05:29.940 This is not an oversight.
00:05:31.870 He does not need to explain the cross with words because he is demonstrating it through his actions.
00:05:37.800 Paul is embodying here the meaning of the cross.
00:05:41.060 He has made himself the place through which Onesimus and Philemon are reconciled to God and then to each other.
00:05:49.160 This letter also shows us that the implications of the good news about Jesus are extremely personal and never private.
00:05:56.220 The fact that Philemon and Onesimus are now brothers in the Messiah
00:05:59.700 makes their master-slave relationship totally irrelevant.
00:06:03.180 The family of Jesus' people is the place where all are equal recipients of God's grace.
00:06:08.500 It is a new kind of society or a "new humanity" as he called it in the letter to the Colossians
00:06:14.760 where people's value, social status is not defined by race or gender or social or economic class.
00:06:21.860 In the Messiah there are simply new humans who are equal partners,
00:06:27.140 who share together in God's healing mercy through Jesus
00:06:31.720 That is what Paul's letter to Philemon is all about.
