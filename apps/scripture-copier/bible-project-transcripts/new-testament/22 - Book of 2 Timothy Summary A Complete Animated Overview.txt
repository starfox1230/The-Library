00:00:03.320 Paul's second letter to Timothy
00:00:05.400 This is Paul's final and most personal letter.
00:00:08.720 He wrote it from yet another time in prison.
00:00:11.140 It is addressed to Paul's dear co-worker and protégé, the young Timothy.
00:00:15.400 We do not know how much time exactly has passed since he wrote 1 Timothy
00:00:19.520 but we can see that Paul's situation has changed and for the worse.
00:00:23.120 He is imprisoned in Rome, which could refer to his time under house arrest that was mentioned in Acts chapter 28
00:00:29.380 or it could be that he was released from that imprisonment,
00:00:32.520 had another long season of ministry and then was arrested again in Troas.
00:00:37.140 Either way, Paul says, he is in the middle of his court trial.
00:00:40.460 It is not going well.
00:00:42.180 He is pretty sure he is not going to survive this one.
00:00:44.760 Out of this very dark situation, Paul appeals to Timothy
00:00:48.880 who, it seems, is still on assignment in Ephesus.
00:00:51.285 He asked Timothy to come be with him in prison
00:00:54.200 so Paul can pass on to him the church planting mission he started.
00:00:58.000 The letter's design is pretty simple.
00:00:59.580 There are two large sections where Paul challenges Timothy first to accept his calling as a leader.
00:01:04.959 Then, before he comes to Paul,
00:01:06.680 to deal with the corrupt teachers that are still causing problems in Ephesus.
00:01:10.840 After this Paul concludes the letter.
00:01:13.000 Paul begins by thanking God for Timothy and his family,
00:01:16.760 specifically for his grandmother, Lois, and his mother, Eunice.
00:01:20.300 They immersed the young Timothy in the story of the Old Testament Scriptures.
00:01:24.640 They instilled in him a deep faith in the Messiah Jesus.
00:01:28.780 Because of that firm faith, Paul offers his first challenge to Timothy.
00:01:33.260 He calls him to reject any temptation to be ashamed of the good news about Jesus
00:01:38.560 or of Paul, who is suffering in prison for announcing that good news.
00:01:42.480 The reason Paul needs to emphasize this is the negative stigma
00:01:45.980 that he gained by his frequent times in prison.
00:01:48.860 It made many of Paul's coworkers, in fact, doubt his calling as an apostle.
00:01:53.000 He mentions two guys: Phygelus and Hermogenes.
00:01:55.820 They deserted Paul because they were ashamed of being associated with Paul, who was an accused criminal now.
00:02:01.720 So Paul asked Timothy to reject any fear of shame and to come see him.
00:02:06.960 Paul knows that this is a costly request.
00:02:09.410 It could put Timothy at risk.
00:02:11.780 So he reminds Timothy that Jesus' grace is a source of power, which is really important.
00:02:17.480 You are going to need it because following Jesus is not easy.
00:02:21.200 It requires everything that you have.
00:02:23.540 Paul likens following Jesus to enrolling as a soldier who is striving to please their commanding officer.
00:02:29.880 Or it is like an athlete who is training their body for a competition.
00:02:33.220 Or it is like a hard-working dedicated farmer.
00:02:35.820 All three of these metaphors involve a person who is committed to something bigger than themselves
00:02:41.120 and who is willing to sacrifice and endure challenges to accomplish a greater goal.
00:02:46.430 Of course, the highest example of this is Jesus himself.
00:02:50.060 Because of his commitment to the Father, he suffered crucifixion by the Romans.
00:02:54.652 Similarly, Paul himself is now suffering in a Roman prison.
00:02:58.580 Hardship and sacrifice are inherent to the Christian life.
00:03:02.520 This is why Jesus'  resurrection is the foundation of Christian hope.
00:03:06.760 Or, as Paul puts it in a short and very powerful poem,
00:03:10.240 if we died with him then we will live with him.
00:03:13.760 If we endure then we will reign with him.
00:03:16.980 If we deny him then he will deny us.
00:03:20.260 If we are unfaithful, he will remain faithful, for he is unable to deny his own nature.
00:03:26.300 God's love for our world has opened up a new hope through the death and resurrection of Jesus.
00:03:32.060 So for those who will take the risk of trusting and following Jesus, God promises vindication and life.
00:03:39.000 For those who reject him, God will honor that decision and do the same.
00:03:43.140 But people's faithlessness will never compel God to abandon his faithfulness
00:03:48.500 So Paul calls Timothy to faithfulness, knowing that it may come with a cost.
00:03:53.380 Paul moves into the second half of the letter,
00:03:55.560 calling Timothy to confront the corrupt teachers in Ephesus before he comes to Rome.
00:03:59.940 Their teaching is spreading in the ephesian church like a cancer.
00:04:03.040 They have targeted and corrupted a number of influential women in the church.
00:04:07.120 These are likely the wealthy women the ball had to deal with in his first letter to Timothy.
00:04:11.500 He does not offer much detail about the teachers bad theology.
00:04:14.530 Timothy already knows about it.
00:04:16.640 He does give us one hint
00:04:18.420 He says they teach that the resurrection has already taken place.
00:04:22.200 We do not know if the teachers are following a Greek philosophical rejection of the whole idea of bodily resurrection
00:04:29.040 and they think it is only really about spiritual experience.
00:04:32.500 Or it could be that they have simply distorted Paul's teaching about the resurrection life
00:04:37.120 that begins now through the power of the Spirit.
00:04:40.020 Either way, the problem is that they have abandoned the robust future hope of resurrection and of new creation
00:04:47.000 They have embraced instead a private, hyper spiritualized Christianity that is disconnected from day-to-day life.
00:04:54.500 So Paul calls Timothy to raise up faithful leaders who are going to teach the real good news about Jesus.
00:05:01.180 They should avoid senseless arguments that result from debating the teachers.
00:05:05.298 In contrast, Timothy and his leadership team are to keep the main thing the main thing.
00:05:11.300 They should focus on the core storyline and message of the Scriptures.
00:05:15.100 In Paul's day, this meant primarily the Old Testament.
00:05:17.820 These scriptures, Paul says, are able to give you wisdom that leads to salvation through faith in the Messiah, Jesus.
00:05:24.980 He is saying the whole point of the scriptures
00:05:27.320 is to tell you a unified story that leads to Jesus and that has wisdom to offer the whole world.
00:05:33.440 Paul talks about scripture's nature and purpose.
00:05:36.160 He says all Scripture is divinely breathed literally, "God's Spirited".
00:05:41.100 It is a reference to the Spirit's role in guiding the biblical authors
00:05:44.870 so that what they wrote is what God wanted his people to hear.
00:05:48.340 God speaks to his people in the scriptures for a very practical purpose
00:05:53.000 He says they are useful for teaching, telling me things I did not know before.
00:05:57.500 They are useful for challenging,
00:05:59.340 getting in my face about the things I say I believe but I do not actually live consistently with.
00:06:03.860 They are useful for correcting me, exposing my messed up ways of thinking and behaving.
00:06:08.880 And they are useful for training me in righteousness, showing me a new way to be truly human.
00:06:14.460 This is also that God's people will be prepared for doing good.
00:06:19.120 Paul closes the letter by reminding Timothy that he is probably not going to make it out of prison alive.
00:06:24.480 So he asks Timothy to come as soon as possible before winter.
00:06:28.020 He does not want to freeze in his cell.
00:06:30.240 So he is going to need his heavy coat that he had to leave behind
00:06:33.100 Also, could Timothy please bring those personal documents that he left in Troas, likely when he got arrested?
00:06:39.410 He also mentions Alexander who is an especially dangerous man that Timothy should avoid.
00:06:45.190 He is probably responsible for Paul's most recent arrest.
00:06:48.640 Paul concludes by mentioning how nearly everyone has abandoned him in prison.
00:06:53.100 His only source of comfort now is the personal presence of Jesus
00:06:56.880 who stands with him and will deliver him, even if he dies.
00:07:01.340 So, the letter ends
00:07:03.100 The letter of 2 Timothy stands as a reminder
00:07:05.380 that Paul's very influential life and mission were marked by persistent challenge, suffering and struggle.
00:07:12.200 Following Jesus involves risk and sacrifice.
00:07:16.000 It means inviting tension and discomfort into your life.
00:07:19.800 These things are not a sign of Jesus' absence.
00:07:23.000 Rather, as Paul discovered with generations of Christians after him,
00:07:26.900 that precisely in those dark and difficult moments,
00:07:30.420 Jesus' love and faithfulness can become the most tangible in real.
00:07:35.679 That is what 2 Timothy, Paul's final letter, is all about.
