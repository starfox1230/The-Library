00:00:00.000 Paul's first letter to Timothy.
00:00:02.060 Paul spent many years traveling about and starting new churches.
00:00:05.260 He developed a large team of co-workers in this mission.
00:00:08.640 Timothy was one of these.
00:00:10.620 Paul was once in the city of Lystra and he met Timothy's faithful mother and grandmother.
00:00:15.580 He was impressed by Timothy's passion and devotion to Jesus.
00:00:19.060 So Paul mentored him for many years and eventually started sending him on missions to different churches.
00:00:24.800 When Paul got word about a group of leaders who infiltrated the influential church in Ephesus--
00:00:30.440 they were spreading incorrect views about Jesus and what it means to follow him--
00:00:34.260 he sent Timothy to confront these leaders and restore order to this church.
00:00:38.860 After Timothy arrived there, Paul sent this letter to follow up and instruct him on how to fulfill this mission.
00:00:45.000 The letter has a really cool design.
00:00:46.600 There is an opening and closing commission to Timothy to go confront these leaders in their bad theology.
00:00:52.507 These surround two large central sections that are full of really practical instructions
00:00:57.620 about the problems that Timothy faced in the Ephesian church
00:01:01.440 Finally, all these sections are linked together or concluded by a series of three poems
00:01:06.900 that each exalt the risen Jesus as the king of the world.
00:01:10.260 Let's dive in and you will see how it works.
00:01:12.400 Paul opens by recalling how he sent Timothy to Ephesus
00:01:15.720 to confront these leaders who were spreading their strange teaching.
00:01:19.560 He describes how these guys are obsessed with speculating about the Torah,
00:01:23.840 specifically the early stories and genealogies in the book of Genesis.
00:01:28.020 As we will see they had developed all kinds of weird teachings about food and marriage and sex
00:01:33.360 that were not consistent with the teachings of Jesus or the apostles.
00:01:37.020 He even names some of these people: Alexander and Hymenaeus.
00:01:40.920 He describes how their teaching has divided the church.
00:01:43.640 It has generated controversy.
00:01:45.540 Paul says this is actually the first clear sign that their teaching is distorted.
00:01:50.300 When genuine Christian teaching is done it is faithful to the way of Jesus.
00:01:54.900 It results in love and genuine faith.
00:01:57.240 He says the purpose of the Torah anyway is not to fuel speculation.
00:02:01.480 Rather, its purpose is to expose the truth about the human condition, as it did for Paul.
00:02:07.014 Correct teaching about the Torah will lead people to see the grace of God revealed in the Messiah
00:02:13.110 who came to save sinful, broken people.
00:02:16.460 Paul closes here with a poem that honors King Jesus over all.
00:02:20.820 He calls on Timothy to shut these men and their false teaching down.
00:02:24.920 He then addresses very specific problems in this church caused by the false teachers.
00:02:30.200 First of all, he calls Timothy to hold regular church prayer gatherings
00:02:34.380 to pray for the governing leaders of Rome and for peace.
00:02:37.600 Because peace in the land creates an ideal setting for Jesus' followers
00:02:42.240 to keep spreading their message about the God of peace who wants all people to be saved,
00:02:47.400 the God who sent Jesus as the only mediator to give his life as a ransom for all, in contrast to the false teachers.
00:02:54.580 Paul reminds Timothy that God wants to rescue the whole world.
00:02:58.680 Prayer is going to keep this at the forefront of their minds.
00:03:02.360 Paul then addresses problems related to men and women
00:03:05.600 who are being influenced by these corrupt leaders in Ephesus.
00:03:08.660 He first shuts down a group of men who were getting drawn into angry theological disputes started by the teachers.
00:03:15.120 He says these guys should learn how to pray.
00:03:17.960 Then he confronts a group of wealthy women in the church
00:03:20.820 who were treating the Sunday gathering like a fashion show.
00:03:24.060 They were dressing so upscale that they would shame most of the other people who could not afford such a wardrobe.
00:03:30.460 Not only that but some of these women were also usurping leadership positions in the church.
00:03:36.060 They were teaching others the bad theology of the corrupt teachers.
00:03:39.840 So Paul shuts these women down.
00:03:42.200 He says they should not teach or lead in the church.
00:03:45.260 It goes on to explore the story of Adam and Eve and the serpent from Genesis chapter 3.
00:03:50.860 This is one of those sections in Paul's letters where, like Peter said, he is kind of hard to understand.
00:03:56.400 There are many different views about what Paul meant here.
00:03:59.600 Some think that Paul is prohibiting women from ever teaching or leading men in any church
00:04:04.820 and that his comments about Adam and Eve are about how God has ordered that only men should be leaders in the church.
00:04:11.220 There are others who think that Paul is prohibiting women from having leadership authority over men in a church
00:04:17.240 but that once educated, women should and can teach as leaders in a church under male leadership.
00:04:23.260 There are still others who think that Paul is only prohibiting these women in Ephesus
00:04:27.960 and that his comments about Adam and Eve are a comparison of how these women have been deceived by the false teachers.
00:04:33.960 Whichever view you take, Paul is clear that these Ephesian women need to come under Timothy's leadership
00:04:40.040 and get a proper theological education.
00:04:43.080 The goal is to help them grow so that they could one day become like the outstanding female ministers
00:04:49.560 that Paul mentions in his other letters, like Phoebe or Junia or Priscilla.
00:04:54.020 Paul continues to address this leadership crisis.
00:04:56.407 He calls Timothy to appoint a small healthy team of husbands and fathers
00:05:01.249 who will act like elders or overseers for the church.
00:05:05.280 These should be men of outstanding character and integrity.
00:05:08.720 They will work alongside a team of deacons.
00:05:11.940 It is a Greek word that means servant.
00:05:14.040 These are men and women who actually lead and do the ministries of the church.
00:05:18.037 they are to have the same kind of character as the elders.
00:05:21.080 Altogether, these people should be known for healthy relationships and their families
00:05:26.100 because that will demonstrate their ability to lead in the church, which is God's family.
00:05:31.320 The way of life that they live all together is consistent with the story about Jesus
00:05:36.620 which is explored in the closing poem about his incarnation, his death, his resurrection, his exaltation as king,
00:05:43.760 then the spread of his new family throughout the whole world.
00:05:47.000 Paul's second body of instructions for Timothy
00:05:49.050 are again very specific to the problems caused by these bad leaders.
00:05:53.280 He first corrects their bad theology.
00:05:55.820 They have been telling people to stop eating certain kinds of foods, most likely meat,
00:05:59.940 and to stop getting married, which Paul thinks is ridiculous.
00:06:03.340 So he goes to Genesis 1.
00:06:04.980 He reminds Timothy that God's entire creation is very good, including food and marriage.
00:06:12.180 It is all to be received with gratefulness by those who know and give thanks to the Creator.
00:06:18.240 Paul then moves on to address problems about the church's care of widows.
00:06:22.340 This very important ministry was being taken advantage of by younger wealthy widows,
00:06:28.260 most likely the same trouble making women from chapter 2.
00:06:31.960 They would sign up for the church's support
00:06:34.160 but then spend their days sleeping around, spreading gossip and damaging the church's reputation in the city.
00:06:40.240 Paul is having none of it.
00:06:42.120 He says that only older widows that have no other family support qualify.
00:06:47.240 For these, the church should show the love of generosity of Jesus.
00:06:51.860 Paul then addresses problems among some older men in the church.
00:06:55.280 Timothy is to respect their age, but not their misbehavior
00:06:59.460 which seems to be alcohol-related.
00:07:01.560 They are damaging the church's reputation in Ephesus
00:07:04.520 So Timothy is, in love, to confront them and have them step down if they are in leadership.
00:07:10.068 Paul adds this interesting side note that this does not mean that Timothy himself should never drink.
00:07:15.600 Given his stomach problems, he should probably have a glass of wine each night with dinner.
00:07:19.980 Paul then addresses a problem among Christian slaves.
00:07:23.260 Some of them were disrespecting their Christian masters.
00:07:26.560 So, yes, the gospel creates equality among Jesus' followers.
00:07:31.360 However, Paul thinks that equality needs to be implemented in a strategic way
00:07:35.580 that does not compromise the mission and witness of the church.
00:07:39.420 If Christians become associated with slave rebellions they are compromised.
00:07:43.700 The Christian transformation of the Roman household had to be implemented strategically
00:07:48.780 so that their neighbors could be persuaded and not repulsed by this new vision of God's family.
00:07:55.020 Paul closes the letter by calling Timothy again to confront the corrupt leaders.
00:07:59.740 Paul here exposes their motives: to make lots of money by accumulating followers
00:08:05.260 and then charging them all high rates for their teaching.
00:08:07.940 These teachers betrayed Jesus and his message of contentment and simple living.
00:08:13.420 Paul instructs the wealthy Ephesian Christians to become rich in good works and generosity,
00:08:19.900 to be people who submit all of their resources to King Jesus.
00:08:23.900 He is the one who inspires the final poem
00:08:27.000 about how he is the true king above all other kings.
00:08:30.800 1 Timothy is a really important letter.
00:08:32.840 It helps us gain a holistic vision of the nature and mission of the church.
00:08:38.039 What a Jesus community believes will directly shape how that community lives and behaves in its city.
00:08:45.100 So, its theology and its beliefs have to be constantly critiqued and formed by the scriptures and the good news about Jesus.
00:08:52.940 How the church is perceived in public is also very important to Paul.
00:08:57.320 Christians should be known as people who are full of integrity, known for good works,
00:09:02.040 known for serving the poor and the most vulnerable,
00:09:05.000 all out of devotion to the risen King Jesus.
00:09:08.825 That is what 1 Timothy is all about.
