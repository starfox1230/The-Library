00:00:03.326 Paul's letter to the Galatians.
00:00:04.946 It was written to a numberof churches in the region of Galatia,
00:00:07.816 where Paul had traveled onone of his missionary journeys.
00:00:10.636 You can read thestories in the book of Acts.
00:00:12.346 He wrote this important letter froma place of deep passion and frustration.
00:00:17.151 Here is the backstory:
00:00:18.351 Christianity began as a JewishMessianic movement in Jerusalem,
00:00:21.951 but, its’ message was for all humanity.
00:00:24.302 And so, it quickly spread beyond Israel.
00:00:26.412 By Paul's time as a missionary,there were as many non-Jews
00:00:29.922 as there were Jewishpeople in the Jesus Movement,
00:00:33.022 and this sparked a huge debate
00:00:35.022 that we know about fromthe book of Acts chapter 15.
00:00:37.836 Historically, the covenant people of Godwere focused in one ethnic group, Israel,
00:00:42.176 and they were set apart by thepractices commanded in the Torah,
00:00:45.596 like circumcision of males,
00:00:47.426 eating kosher,
00:00:48.288 observing the Sabbath.
00:00:49.438 And, there were manyJewish Christians who believed
00:00:51.588 that, for all of these non-Jews
00:00:53.438 to truly become a part of God's family,
00:00:55.798 they needed to obeythe laws of the Torah.
00:00:58.328 And so, some of these Jewish Christians
00:00:59.938 ended up coming to the Galatian churches.
00:01:02.248 They were undermining Paul,
00:01:03.548 and demanding circumcision of allthese male non-Jewish Christians,
00:01:07.848 and so, many of them were.
00:01:09.567 And when Paul found out, hewas brokenhearted and angry,
00:01:13.487 and this letter is the result.
00:01:15.470 He first challenges the Galatians,
00:01:16.970 with his summary of the gospel message
00:01:18.750 about the crucified Messiah.
00:01:20.612 He then argues, that this gospel is
00:01:22.602 what creates the new multi--ethnic Family of Jesus and Abraham,
00:01:26.672 and then he shows how this gospel is
00:01:28.882 what truly transforms people
00:01:30.552 by the presence and power of the Spirit.
00:01:32.932 He opens, by expressing his bewilderment
00:01:35.102 that the Galatians haveembraced a different gospel;
00:01:38.542 it is the one promoted by these Christians
00:01:40.562 who badmouth Paul,and demand circumcision.
00:01:43.543 So Paul first defends theauthenticity of his message,
00:01:46.253 and authority as an apostle.
00:01:48.604 He was commissionedby the Risen Jesus Himself
00:01:51.164 to go to the non-Jewish world;
00:01:52.884 remember the story from the book of Acts.
00:01:54.954 Paul says it was only later,that he went to Jerusalem
00:01:58.304 to consult the otherapostles like Peter and James,
00:02:01.604 and when he told them he wasnot requiring non-Jewish Christians
00:02:05.324 to be circumcised or eat kosher,
00:02:07.364 they were in full support.
00:02:09.086 But this tension ran deeper,
00:02:10.786 Peter had come to Antioch
00:02:12.656 to visit and see all ofthese non-Jewish Christians,
00:02:15.166 and he was eating and mingling with them.
00:02:17.496 But, when some of these Jerusalemopposition groups showed up in Antioch,
00:02:21.896 Peter caved under their pressure;
00:02:23.772 he stopped eating withthese uncircumcised Christians,
00:02:26.412 and he was avoiding them.
00:02:27.862 And so, Paul confrontedand accused Peter of hypocrisy;
00:02:31.562 of not staying true to the gospel.
00:02:33.815 For Paul, demanding these new Christians
00:02:35.895 to become circumcised and Torah observant,
00:02:38.425 it was wrongheadedfor all kinds of reasons.
00:02:41.331 First of all, because itis a betrayal of the gospel,
00:02:44.051 or, in his words:
00:02:44.991 "People are not justifiedby the works of the Torah,
00:02:48.031 but rather by the faithof Jesus the Messiah.
00:02:50.981 And we have faithin the Messiah Jesus.
00:02:54.147 To be justified, or literally,
00:02:55.647 "to be declared righteous".
00:02:57.017 It is a rich Old Testament term for Paul.
00:02:59.620 It is when God declares
00:03:00.810 that someone is in aright relationship with Him;
00:03:03.900 they are forgiven, they aregiven a place in God's Family,
00:03:06.640 and they are beingtransformed by God's grace.
00:03:09.340 And it is Paul's conviction,
00:03:10.720 that no one can be justified byobserving the commands of the Torah,
00:03:14.770 but only by the faith of Jesus.
00:03:17.793 This is a dense phrase,
00:03:18.893 and it could refer toJesus’ own faithfulness
00:03:21.573 in living and dying on our behalf,
00:03:23.603 or, it could refer to ourown trust and devotion to Jesus.
00:03:27.393 Either way, the point is clear:
00:03:29.183 people are justifiedonly through trusting in
00:03:32.023 what God did for them through Jesus,
00:03:34.523 not by what they do for themselves.
00:03:36.852 At the heart ofPaul's gospel is this claim:
00:03:39.472 that when peopletrust in the Messiah Jesus,
00:03:41.742 what is true of Himbecomes true of them:
00:03:45.062 His life, death andresurrection become theirs;
00:03:48.672 or, in his words:
00:03:49.702 "I have been crucified with the Messiah,
00:03:51.812 and it is not I who come back to life,
00:03:53.762 it is the Messiah living in me.
00:03:56.002 And the life I now live,
00:03:57.712 I live by faith in the Son of God,
00:04:00.002 Who loved me, and gave Himself for me.
00:04:02.712 And so, the reason anyone can say
00:04:04.442 that they are right with God,
00:04:06.002 or belong to Jesus’ covenant Family,
00:04:08.322 it is not because theyobey the laws of the Torah;
00:04:11.312 it is only becauseof what Jesus did for them,
00:04:13.982 that they couldnever do for themselves.
00:04:16.362 Now, this profound under-standing of what Jesus accomplished,
00:04:19.652 it has huge implications for
00:04:21.772 who can now be includedin God's covenant Family,
00:04:24.602 and for what it means to liveas a member of that Family.
00:04:28.422 So Paul first turns to thestories about Abraham in Genesis;
00:04:31.582 how he was justified,
00:04:33.292 or declared righteous before God,
00:04:35.272 by simply having faith
00:04:37.002 by trusting in God's promise
00:04:39.312 that one day all nationswould find God's blessing
00:04:42.772 through Him and His offspring.
00:04:44.742 God’s purpose was always to haveone large multi-ethnic family of people
00:04:49.522 who relate to Him on the basis of faith,
00:04:52.162 not on the laws of the Torah.
00:04:54.022 But that raises an important question:
00:04:55.812 "Why did God give the lawsof the Torah to Israel then?"
00:04:59.440 Here, Paul offers a verybrief and dense explanation
00:05:02.090 that he will later fill outin his letter to the Romans.
00:05:04.760 He observes that the laws of the Torah,
00:05:06.680 were given to Israel at Mount Sinai
00:05:08.390 long after God's promise to Abraham.
00:05:11.370 And if you read theTorah carefully, he says
00:05:13.430 you'll see that God always intendedthe laws to be a temporary measure.
00:05:17.988 He says the laws had botha negative and a positive role.
00:05:21.561 Negatively, the laws acted likea magnifying glass on Israel’s sin:
00:05:25.781 they exposed how Israelshared in the sinful human condition,
00:05:29.281 constantly rebelling against God's Law.
00:05:31.761 And so, the Law, which is good,
00:05:33.941 ended up pronouncing Israel guilty,
00:05:36.111 and all humanity with them.
00:05:38.161 Or, in his words,
00:05:39.241 "The laws imprisonedeveryone under the power of sin."
00:05:42.881 But the laws also had a positive role,
00:05:45.351 they acted like a strict schoolteacher
00:05:47.771 that kept Israel in line,
00:05:49.461 until the coming of the promisedOffspring of Abraham: the Messiah.
00:05:53.751 And once the Messiah came,
00:05:55.301 He fulfilled the purposeof the laws on Israel's behalf.
00:05:59.019 Jesus was the Faithful Israelite
00:06:01.049 Who truly loved God and neighbor,
00:06:03.629 and as Israel's King,
00:06:04.930 He died to take the curse
00:06:06.800 and consequence ofIsrael's failure into Himself,
00:06:09.780 and bring redemption.
00:06:11.170 And so now, through Jesus,
00:06:12.500 the Offspring of Abraham,
00:06:13.690 God's blessing can come to all people,
00:06:15.860 regardless of their ethnicity,
00:06:17.810 social status
00:06:18.940 or gender.
00:06:20.188 For Paul, requiring Torahobservance from non-Jewish Christians,
00:06:23.658 it makes no sense.
00:06:25.108 It is acting as if Jesus didnot fulfill God's promise,
00:06:27.578 or deal with our sins.
00:06:29.048 It neglects the new freedomgained for us through Jesus,
00:06:31.968 and the gift of the Spirit,
00:06:33.468 and it limits God's promiseand blessing to one ethnic family.
00:06:37.609 But, Paul's opponents might argue,
00:06:39.359 "The laws of the Torah,they are a proven guide
00:06:41.779 to living according to God's will.
00:06:43.979 How will non-JewishChristians learn this?"
00:06:46.819 Paul responds, in chapters five and six,
00:06:48.999 by describing how Jesus’transforming Presence
00:06:51.529 through the Spirit, is the key.
00:06:54.164 "The laws of the Torah are good,
00:06:56.114 they are wise, Paul says,
00:06:57.884 "In fact they can all besummarized, as Jesus did,
00:07:00.414 in the command to loveyour neighbor as yourself."
00:07:03.244 But the laws, good as they are,
00:07:05.114 they did not give Israelthe power to obey them.
00:07:08.284 In contrast, the good news is
00:07:10.234 that Jesus did fulfillthe laws on our behalf,
00:07:13.484 and now He lives inus through the Spirit,
00:07:16.804 making His people into new humans
00:07:19.074 who fulfill the law by loving others.
00:07:21.424 So, Paul goes on to contrastthis old and new humanity.
00:07:25.523 The habits of the oldhumanity are obvious;
00:07:27.883 these are behaviorsthat dehumanize people,
00:07:30.533 they destroy relationshipsand whole communities.
00:07:33.973 And while the laws of theTorah prohibited these behaviors,
00:07:36.803 Jesus actually put themto death on the Cross.
00:07:39.850 So when a person trusts in Jesus
00:07:41.640 and lives in dependence on the Spirit,
00:07:44.200 his life becomes theirs,
00:07:46.490 and produces what Paul calls
00:07:48.220 "the fruit of the Spirit".
00:07:49.690 This is Jesus’ Way of life
00:07:51.390 that He wants to reproduce in His Family,
00:07:53.780 so that they become people of love,
00:07:56.230 joy,
00:07:57.100 peace,
00:07:57.840 patience,
00:07:58.570 kindness, goodness,
00:07:59.680 faithfulness, gentleness
00:08:01.080 and self-control.
00:08:02.894 But this fruit is not automatic, Paul says
00:08:05.324 it requires cultivation,
00:08:07.104 just like real fruit.
00:08:08.644 Or, in his words:
00:08:09.654 "If we live by the Spirit we haveto keep in step with the Spirit."
00:08:14.124 This requires intentionality.
00:08:15.940 We have to learn how toprune off our old habits,
00:08:18.970 and cultivate new ones.
00:08:20.310 And as we do so,
00:08:21.510 we find ourselvescarried along by the Spirit,
00:08:24.864 as Jesus reshapes our minds and hearts,
00:08:27.424 and makes us into people
00:08:28.734 who love God and others.
00:08:31.334 And in this way, Jesus’ people fulfill
00:08:34.164 what Paul calls,"the Torah of the Messiah".
00:08:37.158 In the end, Paul concludes
00:08:38.597 this requirement for Christiansto become Torah-observant,
00:08:41.398 or be circumcised, it is anadventure in missing the point.
00:08:45.132 What really matters,is God's new Creation,
00:08:48.202 this new multi-ethnicFamily of the Messiah,
00:08:51.182 people full of faith in Jesus,
00:08:53.392 who are learningto love God and others,
00:08:55.562 in the power of the Spirit.
00:08:57.312 And that's what the letterto the Galatians is all about.
