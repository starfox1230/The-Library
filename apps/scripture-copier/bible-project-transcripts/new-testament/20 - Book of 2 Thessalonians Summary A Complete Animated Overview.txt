00:00:03.060 Paul's second letter to the Thessalonians.
00:00:05.820 So not long after Paul wrote 1 Thessalonians,
00:00:08.280 he got a report about the Christians in Thessalonica,
00:00:11.360 and that the problems he had addressed in that letter
00:00:14.040 not only had continued, but had gotten worse.
00:00:16.500 The persecutions had intensified
00:00:18.600 and the Thessalonian Christians had become confused and scared about the return of Jesus.
00:00:23.820 So Paul sent off this short letter
00:00:26.060 which is designed to have three sections that address the three problems in this church.
00:00:30.640 Paul first offers hope in the midst of their continued persecution
00:00:34.480 and then he offers clarity about the coming day of the Lord
00:00:37.660 and then finally he brings a really specific challenge to the idle,
00:00:41.440 people who were refusing to work normal jobs.
00:00:44.100 and the end of each of these sections is clearly marked by a short closing prayer.
00:00:48.900 Paul opens with a thanksgiving prayer
00:00:50.920 for the Thessalonians' continued faithfulness and love,
00:00:54.140 and specifically for their endurance.
00:00:55.900 He's learned that their Greek and Roman, and perhaps even Jewish neighbors
00:00:59.480 have intensified their persecution of these Christians.
00:01:02.240 There are religious minorities facing violent oppression
00:01:05.960 and Paul's worried that they might give up on Jesus if it gets worse.
00:01:09.540 So Paul reminds them like he did in the first letter
00:01:12.340 that they're suffering because of being associated with Jesus,
00:01:15.960 it's a way of participating in God's kingdom.
00:01:18.840 Jesus was inaugurated as king by His suffering on the cross
00:01:23.300 and so his followers will show their victory over the world
00:01:27.000 by imitating Jesus' non-violence and patient endurance.
00:01:31.080 Paul also reminds them that this won't last forever.
00:01:34.340 When Jesus returns, He will bring His justice to bear
00:01:37.860 on those that have oppressed them and shed the blood of the innocent.
00:01:41.380 Specifically, he says that their punishment is
00:01:44.040 to be banished away from the face of the Lord and from the glory of His power.
00:01:48.640 Paul does not speculate here on the fate of those who reject Jesus,
00:01:53.460 except to say that, throughout their lives, they wanted nothing to do with Jesus
00:01:57.680 and in the end, they get what they want:
00:02:00.020 Relational distance from their creator and their King,
00:02:03.560 and for Paul, this is the ultimate tragedy.
00:02:06.660 To choose separation from Jesus who is the source of all life and love
00:02:11.640 is to embrace one's own undoing.
00:02:14.680 He closes this thought by praying
00:02:16.920 that God would use their suffering to bring about deep character change inside of them
00:02:22.040 so that their lives would bring honor to the name of Jesus.
00:02:25.440 Paul then moves on to address a specific issue
00:02:28.480 related to the return of Jesus and the day of the Lord.
00:02:31.240 So somebody in the Thessalonian church community
00:02:33.880 had been spreading wrong information in Paul's name
00:02:37.300 saying that God's final act of justice on human evil, the day of the Lord
00:02:41.860 it was upon them, it has come
00:02:43.700 and these people had likely been predicting dates about the end of all things
00:02:48.080 and they were frightening other Chrstians
00:02:50.320 and you can see why.
00:02:51.600 Due to the intense persecution,
00:02:53.600 they were vulnerable to somebody claiming that Jesus had already returned like a thief in the night,
00:02:58.940 they've been left behind!
00:03:00.160 Maybe He abandoned the Thesslonians to their suffering.
00:03:03.240 This kind of talk really ticks Paul off.
00:03:06.740 It's misrepresenting his teaching.
00:03:09.200 The return of Jesus should never inspire fear
00:03:12.580 but rather hope and confidence.
00:03:14.640 Paul reminds them of everything he taught them about Jesus' return back when he was in town.
00:03:20.020 and he gives a short summary here, it's actually too short.
00:03:23.940 this paragraph has lots of puzzles and problems of interpretation,
00:03:27.660 but what's clear is that he cites the well known theme from the prophets Isaiah and Daniel
00:03:33.140 that the kingdoms of this world will continue to produce rulers who rebel against God
00:03:38.440 like Nebuchadnezzar or the King of the North did in the past.
00:03:42.100 These leaders had exulted themselves to divine authority
00:03:45.440 and for Paul, these ancient kings and prophecies ; they give us images , they set out a pattern
00:03:50.860 that he saw fulfilled in his own day in the Roman emperors, Caligula and Nero,
00:03:55.780 and he expected that it would be repeated again,
00:03:58.600 that history would culminate with such a rebellious rule, empowered by evil itself
00:04:04.040 someone who will wreak havoc and violence in God's world, but not forever.
00:04:08.960 When Jesus returns, He will confront the rebel and all who perpetrate evil, and He will deliver His people.
00:04:15.960 So Paul's point here is not to give later readers fuel for apocalyptic speculation.
00:04:21.180 Rather, he's comforting the Thessalonians. He's recalling the teaching of Jesus from Mark 13
00:04:27.180 who said that the events leading up to His return would be very public and obvious,
00:04:32.240 and so they don't need to be scared or worried that they've been left behind,
00:04:36.380 rather they need to stay faithful until Jesus returns to deliver them. And so in his closing prayer,
00:04:42.780 he asks Jesus and the Father to comfort and strengthen the Thessalonians to stay faithful to the way of Jesus,
00:04:49.480 which brings Paul to the final topic.
00:04:51.780 It's a challenge for those who were idle, which doesn't just mean lazy,
00:04:57.420 but this refers to people who were irresponsible and who refused to work and provide for themselves resulting in chaotic personal lives.
00:05:04.420 So Paul had actually addressed this problem in his first letter, and it seems like it's gotten worse.
00:05:09.720 Now we don't know for certain why some people in this church were refusing to work,
00:05:14.880 it's possible that this problem's connected to the previous one.
00:05:17.740 Maybe some people thought Jesus would return very soon and so they quit their jobs and dropped out of normal life.
00:05:23.560 But it's more likely that Paul's addressing a problem related to a practice in Roman culture called 'patronage'
00:05:30.360 So you'd have poor people living in cities and they would become clients,
00:05:34.600 kind of like personal assistants to wealthy people, and they would live off of their occasional generosity.
00:05:40.620 But there were lots of strings attached.
00:05:43.280 This sometimes involved the clients and their patrons' morally corrupt way of life, not to mention it was unpredictable income.
00:05:50.280 So this is what Paul seems to refer to when he says these people lead a disordered life.
00:05:55.060 They're not working, and they're meddling in the business of others.
00:05:58.380 So Paul reminds them of the example he gave when he was with them; he didn't ask for their money,
00:06:03.900 he worked a manual labor job so he could provide for himself and so he could serve the Thessalonians free of charge.
00:06:10.640 He says this is the ideal: a follower of Jesus should imitate Jesus's self-giving love
00:06:16.400 by working hard so they can provide for themselves and so their lives can be a benefit to other people.
00:06:22.360 He concludes this with a final prayer, that in the midst of all their confusion and suffering
00:06:27.600 that God would grant them peace through the Lord Jesus the Messiah.
00:06:31.700 This short letter to the Thessalonians , it helps us see that the early Christian belief in Jesus' return and the hope of final judgement.
00:06:40.240 These ideas were not meant for generating speculations about apocalytpic timelines.
00:06:45.680 Rather, these beliefs brought hope; they inspired faithfulness and devotion to Jesus,
00:06:50.500 especially for persecuted Christians facing violent opposition.
00:06:53.700 And so for later generations of Christians, whether they undergo persecution or not,
00:06:58.460 this letter reminds us that what you hope for shapes what you live for,
00:07:04.300 and that's what 2 Thessalonians is all about.
