# https://www.youtube.com/watch/HGHqu9-DtXk

00:00:03.300 The gospel according to Mark:
00:00:05.000 it's one of the firstaccounts of the life of Jesus
00:00:07.200 and our earliest historical traditionslink this book to a Christian scribe
00:00:11.150 named Mark, or John Mark.
00:00:13.400 He was co-worker with Pauland close partner with Peter.
00:00:16.900 And in fact an ancient churchhistorian named Papias he recalls
00:00:21.200 that Mark had collected all of theeyewitness accounts and memories of Peter
00:00:25.000 and then shape them in this account.
00:00:27.600 But Mark didn't justrandomly throw the pieces together
00:00:30.400 he's carefully designed the story of Jesus.
00:00:33.200 In the first line of the bookMark makes this claim about Jesus:
00:00:36.800 “it's the beginning of the good newsabout Jesus the Messiah the Son of God.”
00:00:42.000 Now, what's interesting is that this is the only time
00:00:44.500 Mark is going to tell you what he thinks.
00:00:46.400 For the rest of the book, he is going to influence you
00:00:48.600 by simply putting Jesus'actions and words in front of you
00:00:52.000 and showing you how other people react to Him.
00:00:55.000 Now Mark design the storyof Jesus as a drama with three acts:
00:00:58.600 the first one set in Galilee,the third one is set in Jerusalem
00:01:02.300 and the second act shows Jesuson the way from one place to the other.
00:01:06.400 In each of the acts hefocuses on repeated theme
00:01:09.000 so in act 1 everybody's blown awayby Jesus and they’re wondering who is this Jesus
00:01:14.000 In act 2 it's the discipleswho are struggling to understand
00:01:18.100 what it means for Jesus to be the Messiah.
00:01:20.600 And then in act 3 we watch the surprisingparadox of how Jesus becomes the Messianic King.
00:01:26.300 Let's just dive in and you'll see how it unfolds.
00:01:28.700 After the opening line, Mark beginwith a quotation from the ancient prophets
00:01:32.900 Isaiah and Malachi who said thatGod would send messengers in Israel
00:01:36.800 to prepare them for when God wouldshow up himself to rescue His people
00:01:40.600 and become their King.
00:01:41.420 And Mark introduces Johnthe Baptist as the messenger
00:01:45.000 and then right when you expect Godto show it personally Mark introduces Jesus.
00:01:50.000 And as He comes onto the sceneheavens open, God's Spirit descends on Jesus
00:01:54.700 and God says: “You are my beloved Son.”
00:01:57.600 After this Mark places in frontof us a summary of Jesus' core message.
00:02:01.700 He went about Galilee announcing the goodnews that God's kingdom has come near.
00:02:06.600 Jesus is carrying forward thestory from the Old Testament scriptures
00:02:09.900 about God's rescue operation for His world
00:02:12.800 Through Jesus God isrestoring His reign over the world
00:02:16.550 by confronting and defeatingevil and its hold on people's lives.
00:02:20.400 And then by inviting them to liveunder His reign by following Jesus
00:02:25.100 From here Mark's given us a big block of stories
00:02:27.950 showing us Jesus' power as He brings God's kingdom.
00:02:31.000 He goes about healing people whose bodies are sick
00:02:34.200 or broken or under theoppression of dark spiritual powers.
00:02:38.000 And Jesus even does something that forJewish people only God has the right to do:
00:02:42.300 He forgives people's sins.
00:02:44.050 And Jesus' actions hereproduce lots of different responses:
00:02:47.200 so some people followHim and become His disciples,
00:02:50.600 other people don’t know what to thinkand still others reject Him completely,
00:02:54.800 especially Israel's leaderswho accuse Him of blaspheming God
00:02:58.600 and being powered by evil.
00:03:00.500 But Jesus isn’t surprised by theseresponses, in fact He draws attention to it.
00:03:05.400 In chapter 4 Mark hascollected many of Jesus' parables
00:03:08.800 about the hiddenmysterious nature of God's kingdom.
00:03:12.000 Jesus says that His message is likeseed falling on different types of soil:
00:03:16.800 some receptive some not; or it'slike a mustard seed that's very tiny
00:03:21.600 it seems insignificant but thenit grows huge and surprises everyone.
00:03:26.400 Jesus' point is that He really isthe Messiah bringing God's kingdom,
00:03:31.000 but it doesn’t look like what anybody expected.
00:03:34.000 This growing confusion about Jesusamong the crowds is connected to a key idea
00:03:39.050 Mark emphasizes at the end of Act 1
00:03:41.200 that even among Jesus disciples there's confusion
00:03:44.600 even they’re strugglingto grasp who Jesus really is
00:03:47.600 and that brings us to act 2.
00:03:49.500 It begins with a crucial conversation:
00:03:51.500 Jesus takes the disciples asideand He asks: “who do you all say that I Am?”
00:03:55.600 And Peter speaks up saying: “You are The Messiah,”
00:03:58.200 but it becomes clear that for Peter this means
00:04:01.500 that Jesus is a victoriousmilitary King from the line of David
00:04:05.350 will rescue Israel from the Romans,
00:04:07.600 but for Jesus to be the Messiah meansthat He is the suffering servant King
00:04:12.500 of Isaiah 53 who will bring God'srule by giving up His life in Jerusalem.
00:04:18.000 An the disciples they don’t get it
00:04:20.399 they think following King Jesus isgoing to mean fame and status and importance.
00:04:24.900 And Jesus makes it clear thatfollowing Him is actually like dying,
00:04:28.800 like carrying your own cross.
00:04:30.600 It means rejectingviolence and pride and selfishness
00:04:34.100 and giving one's life out forothers in acts of service and love.
00:04:37.800 He has the sameconversation with them two more times
00:04:41.400 and it all culminatesin Jesus' important statement
00:04:44.200 that the Son of man did not cometo be served, but to become a servant
00:04:48.500 and give His life as a ransom for many.
00:04:50.700 The disciples still don't get it,they respond in confusion and fear.
00:04:55.400 And so here in act 2 Mark has placed anotherkey story that echoes the books introduction.
00:05:00.600 Jesus takes three of Hisdisciples up to a mountain
00:05:03.300 and He's suddenly transformed, He'sradiating with light and glory
00:05:07.000 and a cloud envelops them.
00:05:08.600 Now this is just likethe glory of the God of Israel
00:05:11.900 that showed up long ago on Mount Sinai.
00:05:14.200 And then the two prophetswho stood in God's presence on Mount Sinai,
00:05:18.200 Mosses and Elijah they appearnext to Jesus as God announces again:
00:05:22.400 “This is my beloved Son."
00:05:24.800 Now by placing this story in the middleof all these conversations in act 2
00:05:29.000 Mark is making an astounding claim
00:05:31.600 that Jesus God's Son is thephysical embodiment of God's own glory.
00:05:37.700 And in Jesus the glorious Godof Israel is going to become King
00:05:41.800 by suffering and dying forthe sins of His own people.
00:05:45.600 It's a puzzling claimthat confuses and scares the disciples
00:05:49.600 as they leave the mountainwhich brings us to act 3.
00:05:52.400 Jesus makes a very public royalentry into Jerusalem for Passover.
00:05:56.600 People are hailing Him as the Messiah
00:05:58.600 then He enters into the templecourtyard and He asserts His royal authority
00:06:02.500 by running out the thieves and crooksand stopping the sacrificial system.
00:06:07.200 Then this kicks off a whole week of Jesus debating
00:06:09.800 and confronting the leadersof Israel condemning their hypocrisy
00:06:13.000 and so they set in motiona plan to have him killed.
00:06:16.000 And Jesus warn Hisdisciples predicting that Jerusalem
00:06:19.300 and it's temple will bedestroyed within a generation
00:06:22.400 and His disciples will be persecuted just like Him
00:06:26.000 until He return one day to bringGod's kingdom fully over the world
00:06:30.500 And it all leads up to the final night
00:06:32.500 Jesus has His lastPassover meal with the disciples,
00:06:35.600 a symbolic meal, that told the storyof Israel's liberation from slavery
00:06:40.000 through the death of the Passover lamb.
00:06:42.000 And Jesus takes thesesymbols and gives the new meaning:
00:06:45.600 they point to the liberation from sin and death
00:06:48.400 that will happen through the deathof the suffering servant Messiah
00:06:52.000 From here the story rushesforward to Jesus' arrest,
00:06:54.900 His trial before Israel'spriest and the Roman governor Pilate
00:06:58.300 all resulting in Jesus' crucifixion.
00:07:01.000 And culminates in a key scenethat matches the important scenes from acts 1 and 2.
00:07:06.200 Except this time it'sdarkness that descends not a cloud
00:07:10.200 and instead of the divine voice fromheaven it's Jeusus’ crying out before He dies.
00:07:17.000 And then most surprising is that it'sa Roman soldier who sees Jesus died
00:07:21.800 who grasps and then announces who Jesus is:
00:07:25.200 “this man was the Son of God.”
00:07:27.800 He's the first person in the story
00:07:29.700 to recognize the story'sshocking claim about Jesus' identity
00:07:34.000 that it's the crucified Son of Godwho is the Messiah, Jesus of Nazareth,
00:07:38.800 who died for His friends and for His enemies.
00:07:42.800 After this Jesus' body is placed in a tomb
00:07:45.250 and on the first day of the new week twowomen from His disciples come to the tomb
00:07:50.000 and they discover that the tombis empty, the stone is rolled away
00:07:53.800 And then angelic maninforms them that Jesus isn’t here
00:07:57.000 that he's risen from the death.
00:07:59.000 And so he orders them to go and tellthis good news to the others disciples
00:08:02.600 that Jesus is alivethat he'll meet them back up in Galilee.
00:08:06.000 And the women they’re freaked out;
00:08:08.000 Mark say that they fledfrom the tomb in terror,
00:08:11.000 telling no one, for they were afraid.
00:08:13.700 And that's how the book ends:
00:08:15.000 with Jesus disciples showingthe same kind of fear and confusion
00:08:18.850 that concluded acts 2 and 1.
00:08:21.800 Now if you look at your Bible you'll see
00:08:23.300 that the gospel of Mark has more to its ending
00:08:26.000 where Jesus appears,He speaks to His disciples
00:08:28.800 but there's also a note here telling youthat ending is not part of the original book
00:08:33.000 that it's only foundin later less reliable manuscripts.
00:08:36.000 Now it's possiblethat the original ending got lost
00:08:39.000 or that Mark actually never finished his account,
00:08:41.799 but it's more likely that thisabrupt ending is intentional
00:08:45.400 to make a point the entire storyhas focused on the shocking claim
00:08:49.500 that puzzles Jesus' disciplesfrom beginning to end;
00:08:52.600 that is the suffering, crucified andrisen Jesus was the Messiah, the Son of God
00:08:58.000 that God's loveand upside-down kingdom were revealed
00:09:02.000 as Jesus died for the sins of the world.
00:09:05.000 And so the story ends withoutclosure and it forces you, the reader,
00:09:09.300 to grapple with this very strangeand scandalous claim about Jesus.
00:09:13.300 And are you gonna run away like the disciples,
00:09:15.600 or you going to recognize Jesusas your King and going tell the good news?
00:09:20.300 And only you can answer that question.
00:09:23.500 And that's what the gospel of Mark is all about.
