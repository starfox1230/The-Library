00:00:02.790 The New Testament
00:00:04.280 If you open up a Bible to its table of contents, you will see it is made up of two large collections:
00:00:08.880 the Old and New Testaments.
00:00:10.580 The word "testament" refers to a covenant partnership, which is what both of these collections are all about.
00:00:15.740 They tell one epic and complicated story of God's covenant partnership with Israel and all humanity.
00:00:21.800 The Old Testament is called "TaNaK" in Jewish tradition.
00:00:24.660 It is a unified scroll collection of 39 Israelite texts that were over a thousand years in the making.
00:00:30.420 In contrast, the 27 books of the New Testament all came into existence within 30 to 40 years of each other.
00:00:36.400 They were all written by first-generation followers of Jesus.
00:00:39.800 From an early period Christian communities began collecting these texts
00:00:43.320 and reading them alongside the Old Testament as one unified story that leads to Jesus.
00:00:48.340 The New Testament begins with four narrative books that together are called "the Gospel".
00:00:52.340 They tell the story of Jesus of Nazareth's life, death and resurrection as an announcement of good news.
00:00:57.900 They are followed by a fifth narrative work called "Acts of the Apostles".
00:01:01.280 Here, the risen Jesus commissions the apostles, a word that means "the sent ones".
00:01:05.980 They are appointed as Jesus' representatives to spread the good news about him throughout the ancient world.
00:01:11.180 After Acts comes a collection of letters from the apostles.
00:01:14.780 These were written to provide teaching and guidance for local communities of Jesus' followers called "churches".
00:01:20.220 There are 13 letters connected to the Apostle Paul.
00:01:22.680 They are not arranged in the order of when they were written.
00:01:25.560 But, rather, from the longest to the shortest.
00:01:28.180 Then there is a letter to the Hebrews written by a close but unnamed associate of the apostles.
00:01:32.740 After this are the letters of James, Jude, Peter and John.
00:01:36.460 Two were brothers of Jesus and two were among his first followers.
00:01:40.200 The last New Testament book is the Revelation,
00:01:42.580 a letter to seven churches that reveals a prophetic word of challenging comfort to all of Jesus' followers.
00:01:48.600 So those are the books of the New Testament, but what are they about?
00:01:51.720 And, how do they connect with the Old Testament to make up one unified story?
00:01:56.260 Think of it this way:
00:01:57.400 The Bible is one long epic narrative with multiple movements or acts.
00:02:01.540 The Old Testament recounts the first series of acts that give you everything you need to make sense of the story to follow.
00:02:07.620 The core themes and the plot conflict are arranged in design patterns.
00:02:12.100 Then, in the New Testament, these are all picked up and carried forward to the story's culmination in Jesus.
00:02:17.500 Let me show you what I mean.
00:02:18.740 The first act is about God and all of humanity.
00:02:21.100 God provides a sweet garden temple for humans who are made to be God's partners in ruling the world.
00:02:26.260 But the humans are foolish.
00:02:27.960 They give in to a dark temptation and rebel against God's wisdom.
00:02:31.760 So they are exiled into a wilderness where they start killing each other.
00:02:35.300 They build cities that spread their selfishness and oppression, leading up to the big, bad city of Babylon.
00:02:41.300 But, God loves the world and its foolish humans.
00:02:44.060 So, he sets in motion a rescue plan by promising the arrival of a new human
00:02:48.620 who will destroy the evil that has lured us into self-destruction.
00:02:52.320 The next act of the biblical story is about God and Israel.
00:02:55.820 It develops the themes and patterns of the first act.
00:02:58.940 God calls a new humanity out of Babylon into a sweet garden land:
00:03:03.080 Abraham, Sarah and his descendants, the Israelites.
00:03:06.360 God promises that through them divine blessing will be restored to all of the nations.
00:03:10.920 Surely, these are the new humans that we are waiting for.
00:03:13.600 But the Israelites repeat humanity's rebellion against God,
00:03:17.520 building their own violent cities that lead to self-destruction and another exile in Babylon.
00:03:22.460 But God sustains his promise that the new human will come from Abraham's lineage.
00:03:26.940 It will be a priest king who will now have to rescue both Israel and humanity from Babylon
00:03:32.920 to restore God's blessing to the world.
00:03:35.000 Now, notice how these two acts are designed according to the same pattern.
00:03:38.840 The second act is a longer and more violent version of the first.
00:03:42.180 Together, they explore the tragic human condition.
00:03:45.100 But they also highlight God's promise which is developed more in the next act: the Old Testament prophets and poets.
00:03:51.120 The prophets accused Israel and all nations of their evil.
00:03:54.280 They announce that one day God himself would arrive to bring the day of the Lord and deliver his world from Babylon.
00:04:00.820 He would do it through a promised royal priest who is going to suffer like a slave and die for the sins of Israel and all humanity.
00:04:08.640 But, then he will be exalted as king over the nations.
00:04:11.620 He will call others to leave Babylon and join the new covenant people who will partner with God to rule over a New Jerusalem.
00:04:19.500 That is, over a new creation.
00:04:21.380 So, the Old Testament concludes by anticipating a new act in the story.
00:04:25.900 When you turn to the New Testament, it is the same story now being carried forward in Jesus.
00:04:31.200 Let's see how.
00:04:32.280 The four Gospel accounts introduce Jesus of Nazareth
00:04:34.880 both as the promised son of Abraham who will restore God's blessing to the nations
00:04:39.160 and also as that new human who will defeat evil and restore humanity to partnership with God.
00:04:45.140 So, Jesus is portrayed as a human, and more!
00:04:48.380 He went about announcing the arrival of God's promised kingdom.
00:04:51.640 He spoke and acted as if he was Israel's divine king.
00:04:55.700 But instead of calling himself "King", Jesus referred to himself as the "Son of Man".
00:04:59.940 That is, the human one who would act like a servant.
00:05:02.646 The Gospels are making the claim that in Jesus,
00:05:05.200 Israel's God has become the faithful Israelite and the true human that we are all made to be, but have failed to be.
00:05:12.640 Jesus' mission was to confront that dark evil that lurks underneath humanity's evil,
00:05:17.820 luring us into selfishness, violence and death.
00:05:20.720 But, how do you defeat that kind of evil?
00:05:23.420 The surprising answer in the Gospels is that Jesus overcame our evil by allowing it to kill him,
00:05:28.900 on his paradoxical throne, the cross, where Jesus died for humanity's evil and sin.
00:05:35.300 And, it is where he lived out what he taught:
00:05:37.920 that non-violence, forgiveness and self-giving love are the most powerful things in the universe.
00:05:43.460 Because God's love for his world is stronger than evil or death,
00:05:46.720 Jesus was raised to new life as the prototype of a new humanity.
00:05:51.020 This brings us to the story of Acts
00:05:53.040 Through the Spirit, God empowers Jesus' followers to spread the life and love of Jesus out into the world
00:06:00.000 as they invite people to leave their old humanity and join Jesus' multi-ethnic family: the new humanity.
00:06:06.560 This is where the letters from the apostles fit into the story.
00:06:09.308 Here, the apostles address early Christian communities.
00:06:12.040 They show how the good news about the risen King Jesus change history and should reshape every part of our lives.
00:06:18.620 They also explained the good news by constantly appealing to stories from the Old Testament and the stories of Jesus,
00:06:25.060 showing us how to see our own life stories as part of the epic biblical story.
00:06:30.560 So all humanity is trapped in a Babylonian exile, but Jesus came to create a new home.
00:06:36.600 We are all living in different kinds of Egyptian slavery to selfishness and sin.
00:06:40.820 But Jesus died as the Passover lamb to liberate us into the promised land.
00:06:45.400 Our old humanity is bound for the dust of death, but Jesus' resurrection opened up a new future for a new humanity.
00:06:52.380 We live here in the current evil age
00:06:54.740 but through Jesus and the Spirit a new creation has burst open here and now.
00:06:59.880 This leads us to the book of Revelation where the whole biblical story comes together in powerful symbolism and imagery.
00:07:06.440 Jesus is portrayed as a slaughtered bloody lamb who is exalted as the divine king of the world.
00:07:12.020 He is leading his people out of slavery  and exile in Babylon.
00:07:15.300 As they resist Babylon's influence, they may have to suffer alongside their slain leader.
00:07:20.440 But when you follow the Risen King, not even death can prevent the dawn of the New Creation
00:07:25.760 which is here depicted as a New Jerusalem garden temple, the true home of humanity after its long exile.
00:07:32.760 So, on the Bible's last page, heaven and earth are reunited.
00:07:36.450 The new humans take up their appointed tasks from the Bible's first page: to rule the world together in the love and power of God.
00:07:44.360 The New Testament is a remarkable collection of documents.
00:07:47.380 They represent the testimony of the apostles that points us to the Risen Jesus himself.
00:07:52.740 Through God's Spirit, these human words have been speaking a divine word of hope from the first century to the 21st.
00:08:00.480 Each book shows how God, through Jesus and the Spirit, is leading our world to its ultimate goal in a renewed creation
00:08:08.080 So, the story's end is really the beginning of a new story that is yet to be told.
00:08:13.380 That is what the New Testament is all about.
