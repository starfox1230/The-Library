00:00:02.340 Paul's first letter to the Corinthians was written to a church community that Paul knew really well.
00:00:07.710 Corinth was a major port city in theancient world and had lots of temples to
00:00:12.000 Greek and Roman gods. It was a bigeconomic center and so Paul
00:00:15.430 strategically came here as a missionary. He spent a year and a half there
00:00:19.230 getting to know people, talking to themabout Jesus and a whole bunch of people
00:00:22.830 became followers of Jesus and formed achurch community. You can read about all
00:00:26.759 of this in Acts chapter 18.
00:00:29.180 So after a while Paul moved on to startchurches in other cities and he started
00:00:33.130 getting reports that things were notgoing well at all
00:00:36.580 back at the church in Corinth. He wasplagued by all kinds of problems and
00:00:40.410 that's why he wrote this letter. It'sbroken up into five main parts along
00:00:44.420 with the final greeting. And these fivesections correspond to five main
00:00:48.600 problems that Paul is addressing. And sothe letter reads like a collection of
00:00:52.650 short essays on different topics butthere are these core ideas that unite
00:00:57.010 all of the pieces together. So here'swhat he does in each section. He describes
00:01:01.360 the problem, but then he always respondsto that problem with some part of the
00:01:06.200 story of the gospel, which is the goodnews about Jesus. And he shows how
00:01:10.550 they're actually not living out whatthey say they believe. And so this letter is
00:01:15.960 all about learning to think about everyarea of life through the lens of gospel.
00:01:21.619 So let's dive in and see how he does it. In chapters one through four the problem
00:01:25.580 is that there are these divisions in thechurch. There are some other teachers who had
00:01:29.700 come through town since Paul left--a guynamed Apollos, and then Peter, and people
00:01:34.479 had picked their favorite teacher and thenbecame groupies around that leader and
00:01:39.100 then started to talk bad and disrespectpeople who favored another leader or
00:01:43.170 teacher. And so Paul, his response to thisis kind of sarcastic and sharp. He says, "You
00:01:48.080 have to be kidding me!
00:01:49.400 The church is not a popularity contest.The church is the community of people
00:01:54.330 who are centered around Jesus. Itsleaders and its teachers are simply
00:01:59.590 servants of Jesus. So while you mightprefer one leader more than another,
00:02:04.979 it's not worth dividing over andcertainly not speaking poorly about each
00:02:09.459 other.
00:02:10.070 The center of the church is Jesus andthe good news about who he is and what
00:02:14.450 he's done. In chapters five through seven,Paul addresses some problems related to
00:02:18.690 sex. There were a number of peoplesleeping around in the church-- one guy
00:02:22.720 with his stepmother and a number of otherpeople still worshipping at the local
00:02:27.130 temples to Greek gods and sleeping withthe prostitutes who worked there. Not
00:02:31.530 only that, but there were people in thechurch who were saying that this was all
00:02:35.450 just fine. They said, "Hey, we're free inChrist! God's grace is bottomless, right?
00:02:40.130 It's fine."  And Paul said it's not fine. And with thegospel in hand he shows just how
00:02:45.800 wrong-headed this kind of thinking is. Hesays, "Remember first of all, Jesus died
00:02:50.700 for your sins, including the ruin ofbroken relationships that's caused by
00:02:55.820 sexual misconduct. And so if you're aChristian, sexual integrity is one of the
00:03:00.950 main ways that we respond to Jesus'love and grace." Paul also reminds them
00:03:06.550 that just as Jesus was physically raisedfrom the dead, so our bodies will be
00:03:11.650 raised from the dead. Which means this: ifyour body is being redeemed by Jesus now
00:03:16.400 and in the future, then what you do withyour body
00:03:19.870 matters. It matters a lot. And it's notyours to do whatever you want with. Paul is being
00:03:25.540 super clear. Being a follower of Jesusinvolves no compromise when it comes to
00:03:30.650 sexual integrity.
00:03:32.920 In chapters 8 through 10 the issue is aboutfood, but not just food preferences like
00:03:37.540 "Do you like or dislike a certain food?"  Theissue the Corinthians were divided over is
00:03:42.250 meat that came from animals sacrificed inthe local temples to Greek and Roman
00:03:47.069 gods. And there was a split between theJewish and non-Jewish Christians about
00:03:51.069 how to respond to this issue. And onceagain Paul appeals to some core ideas
00:03:55.660 from the gospel. He says our allegiancefirst and foremost is to Jesus as Lord,
00:04:00.420 not to any other gods. And so if you'rein a situation where there's meat that's
00:04:05.209 been dedicated to another god and thereare people around who might watch you
00:04:10.140 and conclude, "Oh, look! Christiansworship Jesus and they can worship other
00:04:14.230 gods too." Paul says if that's the scenario,don't eat the meat. Your loyalty is to
00:04:19.720 Jesus and you should love those peoplemore than yourself and not mislead them.
00:04:25.760 But Paul quickly qualifies this and says,"Listen, as Christians we believe God is
00:04:30.620 the Creator of all things including thatanimal. And the temple idols, we believe,
00:04:35.580 are just pieces of wood and stone. So ifthere's no one around who's going to
00:04:39.919 misunderstand your actions and you'rehungry, eat up! You're free as a new
00:04:44.690 human in Christ to follow yourconscience in these kind of debatable
00:04:47.919 matters. So what makes it ok in onesituation to eat but not in the other?
00:04:52.870 The core principle is love. Love willdeny itself and look out for the
00:04:58.800 well-being of other people. And love,God's love, is at the core of the gospel.
00:05:03.050 It's what Jesus did when he died for usand so Paul says it's what Christians
00:05:07.729 should do for other people. In chapters11 through 14 Paul moves on and
00:05:11.570 addresses problems in their weeklyworship gathering. There were some people
00:05:15.410 who were having really powerfulspiritual experiences in the gathering
00:05:19.470 and so they would start praying out loudin unknown languages. There were other
00:05:24.070 people who might start sharing ateaching or a word from God and then
00:05:27.810 someone would get up and interrupt thembecause they wanted to share. And it all was
00:05:31.950 really chaotic and it was distractingpeople, especially visitors, from hearing
00:05:35.889 the gospel.
00:05:37.409 So in these chapters Paul helps themthink first of all about the purpose of
00:05:41.019 this gathering-- to help them see whatkind of behaviors are appropriate.
00:05:45.350 He says the gathering is a place whereGod's Spirit should be working through
00:05:49.100 everybody and it should happen in aunified way. So he developes this cool
00:05:54.250 metaphor about the church as a humanbody. It's one but it has all these
00:05:58.880 different parts and each part serves aunique and important role. So he goes on
00:06:03.710 to name a whole bunch of things thatthe Spirit does through all these
00:06:07.220 different people, all for thebuilding up of the church (that's a key
00:06:11.400 phrase in these chapters). And Paulconcludes that the highest value in the
00:06:15.800 gathering should be a concept central tothe gospel--God's love. Love is the key
00:06:21.720 word in these chapters too.  Love willcompel each person in the gathering to
00:06:27.050 use their role to serve and seek thewell-being of others. So Paul applies all
00:06:32.540 this to the Corinthian's problems.
00:06:34.449 Some people think the purpose of thegathering is to have intense spiritual
00:06:38.300 experiences or to get a chance to speaktheir mind.
00:06:41.479 And Paul says, "Listen, I'm a big fan ofpowerful experiences of prayer but if it
00:06:46.050 distracts other people or freaks themout, I should stop it because I'm loving
00:06:50.339 myself more than I am loving thosepeople." The gathering around Jesus should
00:06:55.330 be orderly so everybody can learn and sing and worship and hear God speaking to them.
00:07:01.960 The last problem Paul addresses is theissue of Jesus' resurrection and the
00:07:06.460 future hope of Jesus' followers. Therewere some people in the church who were
00:07:11.139 saying that the idea of resurrection isridiculous and doesn't really matter to
00:07:15.509 being a Christian. And Paul reacts tothis big time. He begins by saying that
00:07:20.220 the resurrection is an indispensablepart of the gospel. We believe in it
00:07:24.900 because of the hundreds of eye witnessesthat saw Jesus alive in a physical
00:07:29.759 body after being publicly executed bythe Romans.
00:07:33.930 If Jesus didn't rise from the dead, Paulsays, that his death was meaningless, we
00:07:38.470 are all still lost in our sin and selfishness, weshould just stop being Christians.
00:07:43.449 Paul then shows in detail how theresurrection was Jesus' victory over
00:07:48.309 death and evil, how it's a source of lifeand power for us now in the present and
00:07:53.219 how it's a promise of future hope forthe whole world. It's because of the
00:07:57.050 resurrection that we have a reason to be unified around Jesus. It's the reason we
00:08:02.139 have motivation for sexual integrity. It's the source of power for loving
00:08:06.770 other people more than ourselves andultimately it's our hope for victory over death.
00:08:11.870 And so, Paul concludes, we do believeJesus was raised from the dead, which
00:08:17.070 means this: the gospel is not just moraladvice or a recipe for private
00:08:22.750 spirituality. It's an announcement aboutJesus that opens up a whole new reality.
00:08:29.020 And that's what 1 Corinthians is allabout--seeing every part of life through
00:08:34.900 the lens of that gospel.
