00:00:02.440 The letter to the Hebrews: The author of this letter is anonymous and people have wondered
00:00:06.680 for long time whether Paul wrote it maybe one of his
00:00:09.720 co-workers like Barnabas or Apollos but really we just dont know.
00:00:13.460 In chapter 2, we discover that the author had a
00:00:15.720 first-hand relationship with the disciples
00:00:17.880 who were themselves around Jesus. So, we know
00:00:20.600 that this letter is anchored in teaching of the apostles.
00:00:23.400 We also don't know who the audience of this letter was
00:00:26.180 or even where they lived. The author knows them really well
00:00:27.700 and he assumes that they have a thorough knowledge of the Old testament scriptures,
00:00:32.280 especially the storyline of the first 5 books of the bible or the Torah.
00:00:36.180 About how Abraham's family became the nation of Israel,
00:00:38.660 about how Moses led them out of slavery in Egypt
00:00:41.380 to mount Sinai where they received the Torah
00:00:44.020 and they made a covenant with God where they built
00:00:46.660 the tabernacle, where the priests offered sacrificies
00:00:50.200 and also about how they wandered through the wilderness
00:00:53.000 on their way to the Promise Land.
00:00:54.580 The author just expects that the readers know all of the details about these stories
00:00:59.180 and so most likely the audience is made up of
00:01:00.840 Jewish Christians that´s where the name of the letter comes from.
00:01:04.760 We also have clues from chapter 10 that this church
00:01:07.080 community was facing persecution and even
00:01:10.120 imprisonment because of their association with Jesus.
00:01:12.340 Some in the community were walking away from Jesus
00:01:16.000 and abandoning the faith all together and
00:01:18.000 this explains the purpose and the structure of this letter.
00:01:20.980 First there´s a short introduction which is followed by four sections where the author compares and contrasts Jesus
00:01:28.160 with key people and events from Israel´s history. Jesus is first compared with angels in the Torah,
00:01:33.860 second with Moses and the Promised Land.
00:01:36.640 Third with priests and Melchizedek
00:01:39.440 and lastly with the sacrifices in the covenant
00:01:42.100 and the author has two main goals in all of these contrasts.
00:01:45.420 The first goal is to elevate Jesus as superior to anyone or anything else.
00:01:50.120 Showing that Jesus is worthy of all their trust and devotion,
00:01:54.280 But the second goal is this, is to challenge the readers to remain faithful to Jesus despite persecution.
00:01:59.780 So in every section he includes a strong warning, not to abandon Jesus.
00:02:04.620 So lets dive in now and see how this all unfolded.
00:02:07.000 The elevation of Jesus begins in the opening sentence of the introduction. In the past
00:02:11.800 God spoke to our ancestors in many different ways but in these last days, he has spoken to us in his Son.
00:02:19.640 So the author is saying that Jesus is superior to all of the previous ways that God has revealed himself
00:02:25.800 to Israel. He then makes this astounding claim that Jesus is the radiance of God´s glory and the exact
00:02:32.760 imprint of  God´s nature. These metaphores are making the closests possible identification between Jesus and God
00:02:39.560 So Jesus is what the rays of light are to the sun. Where Jesus is what the wax impression is to the signet ring.
00:02:47.400 For this author there is no God apart from Jesus. Jesus is God become human as the Son
00:02:54.280 and it's this elevated view of Jesus that´s then explored troughout the rest of letter.
00:02:59.380 In the first section the author compares Jesus with angels which might strike you kind of odd,
00:03:03.700 like why angels? In Jewish tradition it was taught based on deuteronomy chapter 33 verse 2
00:03:09.640 that the Torah and the word of God were delivered  to Moses at mount Sinai by angels.
00:03:15.360 And so by saying Jesus is superior to angels the author is claiming that Jesus and his message of good news
00:03:21.700 are superior to all previous messangers of God word.
00:03:25.180 And so the first warning flows from this great point. If Israel was called to pay attention to the Torah that was
00:03:31.120 delivered by angels how much more should we pay attention
00:03:34.800 to the message that was announced by the Son of God? And not only that.
00:03:39.300 Given Jesus´ status high above angels how remarkable is it that he gave up that high status
00:03:45.900 to become human to suffer and to die.
00:03:49.440 in Jesus we see God´s greatest glory and God´s great humillity
00:03:54.160 as Jesus sympathetically joined himself to humanity´s tragic fate.
00:03:58.960 In chapters 3 and 4 the author moves on to argue that Jesus is superior to Moses
00:04:04.080 who led the people of Israel through the wilderness and built the tabernacle.
00:04:07.740 Jesus is also the leader of God´s people but in Him we see not the builder of just a tent but of all creation.
00:04:15.380 then the author retells the story of how the israelites rebelled against  Moses in the wilderness
00:04:20.579 and they lost their chance to enter into the rest that God offered them in the Promised Land
00:04:26.340 and so here comes the second warning.
00:04:28.760 If Jesus is greater than Moses how much higher are the stakes if we rebel against him?
00:04:34.040 We also are in a wilderness-like environment where we have to trust God
00:04:38.140 for the future rest in God´s new creation.
00:04:41.520 So lets make sure that we don´t rebel like Israel did in the wilderness
00:04:46.060 and lose out on God´s gracious offer to enter his new creation.
00:04:49.980 in chapters 5 trough 7 the author then compares Jesus with Israel´s priests that come from the line of Aaron.
00:04:56.520 Their role was to represent Israel before God and to offer sacrifices that atoned for or covered over for the sins
00:05:02.960 the sins of the people but he points out, the priests were themselves morally flawed people and so they
00:05:09.140 constantly had to offer sacrifices for their own sins as well as for everybody else's.
00:05:13.680 Something more was needed, and so he then argues that Jesus was that something more.
00:05:18.740 He's the ultimate priest. But Jesus did not come from the line of Aaron,
00:05:24.040 rather Jesus was a priest in the order of Melchizedec,
00:05:27.280 that misterious priest king from ancient Jerusalem and he appears in the stories about Abraham.
00:05:33.200 We also find in Psalm 110 that the messianic King from the line of David
00:05:38.180 will be a priest in the order of Melchizedec.
00:05:41.080 So the authors whole point is this, Jesus is the ultimate priest King,
00:05:46.600 He´s morally flawless , He´s eternal available for his people, and so He´s superior
00:05:51.660 to any other mediator between God and and humans. And thus comes his warning in this section.
00:05:56.860 To reject Jesus is to reject one´s best and only chance to be fully reconciled to God,
00:06:03.040 so don´t do that. Which transitions us into the last comparison in chapters 8 through 10.
00:06:08.520 The author shows how Jesus´ death on the cross was the ultimate sacrifice,
00:06:13.020 superior to all the animal sacrifices offered in the temple.
00:06:16.680 Those sacrifices had to be offered constantly, both daily but also yearly  on the Day of Atonement.
00:06:22.360 Jesus offered his life once and for all, and was sufficient to cover the whole world.
00:06:28.840 And so the author warns the audience from walking away from Jesus,
00:06:32.720 its like turning your back on a gracious offer of God´s forgiveness,
00:06:36.680 why would you do that? Jesus´ sacrifice is permanent he says,
00:06:40.260 and its the foundation for the new covenant spoken of in the prophets were all sins are forgiven.
00:06:45.740 So, now that the author has elevated Jesus through all of these contrasts,
00:06:49.800 this final section is one big challenge to follow Jesus. So think big picture;
00:06:55.900 In Jesus they have found God´s very word, in Jesus they have hope for the new creation,
00:07:01.400 Jesus is their eternal priest, He´s the perfect sacrifice, and so now they should follow all te great models of
00:07:08.800 faith found throughout  the story of the scriptures and they should remain faithful to Jesus
00:07:13.960 trusting that despite whatever hardship of persecution, God will not abandon his people.
00:07:19.440 That´s the basic flow of thought throughout the letter which the author call right here at the very end
00:07:24.180 "a brief word of exhortation." Here a couple of extra tips for reading this letter.
00:07:28.680 Whenever the author quotes from the Old Testament scriptures, which is like every other sentence
00:07:33.640 stop, and go look up the reference and read that quotation in its original context
00:07:38.480 and sometimes you´ll be puzzled but more often you´ll see all kinds of extra, cool conections
00:07:43.720 that you would never notice otherwise, it´s totally worth the effort.
00:07:46.460 You should also just know that these warning passages,
00:07:50.120 they´re going to make you unconfortable and that´s kind of the point.
00:07:53.140 They are not there to make you afraid, they are there to show you that rejecting Jesus is foolish
00:07:58.720 because He´s so awesome. These warning all serve the larger purposes of the letter;
00:08:03.340 To show that Jesus is the ultimate revelation of God´s love and mercy.
00:08:08.800 And that´s what the letter to the Hebrews is all about.
