00:00:02.340 The Gospel according to Matthew. In thefirst video we saw how Matthew introduced
00:00:06.819 Jesus as the Messiah from the line ofDavid, and as a new authoritative teacher
00:00:11.660 like Moses, and also as Emmanuel which inHebrew means "God with us." After Jesus
00:00:17.939 announced and taught about the arrival ofGod's kingdom and after he brought the
00:00:21.720 kingdom into day-to-day life among thepeople of Israel, we saw that Jesus was
00:00:25.949 accepted by many but rejected by others,especially Israel's religious leaders,
00:00:30.980 the Pharisees. And so the big question is, "Howis this conflict between Jesus and
00:00:35.739 Israel's leaders going to play itselfout?" The next large section, chapters 14
00:00:40.680 through 20, explore all the differentexpectations people have about the
00:00:44.780 Messiah. Jesus keeps healing sick peopleand twice he even miraculously provides
00:00:50.000 food for these huge crowds in the desert,one made up of Jewish people and the
00:00:54.989 other is a non-jewish crowd. And thissign is very similar to what Moses did
00:00:59.660 for Israel in the wilderness. And so arethese people are excited about Jesus,
00:01:04.399 they think he's the great prophet and theMessiah, but not the religious leaders.
00:01:08.649 Their view of the Messiah is built onpassages like Psalm 2 or Daniel chapter 2,
00:01:14.159 about a victorious Messiah who is going todeliver Israel and defeat the pagan
00:01:18.759 oppressors. And from their point of view,Jesus is a false teacher. He's making
00:01:23.149 blasphemous claims about himself and sothere are stories here about them
00:01:27.130 increasing their opposition, hatching aplan to kill him. And so in response,
00:01:31.479 Jesus, he withdraws. And he begins teachinghis closest disciples what it means for
00:01:36.469 him to be Israel's Messiah because it isnot what anybody expects. So Jesus asked
00:01:42.689 his disciples-- chapter 16-- he says, "Who doyou all say that I am?" And Peter comes up
00:01:47.719 with the right answer, it seems. He says,"You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God."
00:01:50.679 But then it becomes clear that Peter'sthinking about a king who's going to
00:01:55.630 reign victoriously through military power. And Jesus challenges Peter, saying that
00:02:00.909 "Yes, I am going to become king, butthrough a different way." And so Jesus
00:02:05.709 starts to teach on themes from theprophet Isaiah who said that the
00:02:09.788 Messianic King would suffer and die forthe sins of his own people. And so Jesus,
00:02:16.159 he was positioning himself as aMessianic king who reigns by becoming a
00:02:21.299 servant and who would lay down his lifefor Israel and the nations.  Peter and
00:02:27.000 the disciples, they mostly just don't get it. And so Jesus enters into the fourth
00:02:31.260 block of teaching followed by a seriesof teachings after that. And these are
00:02:35.390 all about the upside down nature ofJesus' Messianic Kingdom--which turns
00:02:40.549 upside down all of our value systems. Soin the community of the servant king you
00:02:45.849 gain honor by serving others and insteadof getting revenge, you forgive and do
00:02:52.280 good to your enemies. And in Jesus'kingdom you gain true wealth by giving
00:02:57.069 your wealth away to the poor. To followthe servant Messiah, you must become a
00:03:01.959 servant yourself. In the next section wewatched the two kingdoms clash--Jesus'
00:03:07.670 kingdom and that of Israel's leader.Jesus comes to Jerusalem for Passover
00:03:11.920 riding in on a donkey and the crowds arehailing him as the Messiah. Jesus
00:03:15.920 immediately marches into the courtyardof the temple and he creates this huge
00:03:20.060 disruption that brings the dailysacrifices to a halt. His actions speak
00:03:25.090 louder than words here. As Israel's King,Jesus was asserting his royal authority
00:03:30.439 over the temple, the place where God andIsrael met together. And in Jesus' view, the
00:03:36.269 temple was compromised by the hypocrisyof Israel's leaders and so here he's
00:03:40.450 challenging their authority andnaturally they're deeply offended. And so
00:03:44.430 they try to trap Jesus and shame him inpublic debate and they fail. So they end
00:03:49.120 up just determining to have him killed.In response, Jesus delivers his final
00:03:53.579 block of teaching. He first offersthis passionate critique of the Pharisees
00:03:57.549 and their hypocrisy. And then he weepsover Jerusalem and its rejection of God
00:04:03.310 and His Kingdom. Then Jesus withdrawswith the disciples and he starts telling
00:04:07.469 them what's going to happen. He's goingto be executed by these leaders, but in
00:04:12.060 doing so they're going to create theirown demise because instead of accepting
00:04:16.470 Jesus' way of the Peaceful Kingdomthey're going to take the road of revolt
00:04:20.769 against
00:04:21.389 Rome and so Jerusalem and its temple aregoing to be destroyed. But Jesus says
00:04:26.469 that is not the end of the story.
00:04:28.509 He's going to be vindicated after hisdeath by his resurrection and one day
00:04:32.199 he'll return and set up his kingdom overall nations. And so in the meanwhile, the
00:04:37.800 disciples need to stay alert and staycommitted to just announcing Jesus and
00:04:42.919 His Kingdom and spreading the good news. And so with all of that ringing in the
00:04:46.990 disciples ears, the story comes to itsclimax. That night Jesus takes the
00:04:51.810 disciples aside and he celebrates the Passovermeal with them.
00:04:55.319 Passover retells the story of Israel'srescue from slavery through the death of
00:04:59.580 the Passover lamb. And then Jesus takesthe bread and the wine from this meal as
00:05:04.610 new symbols showing that his comingdeath would be a sacrifice that would
00:05:09.740 redeem his people from slavery to sinand evil. After the meal, Jesus is arrested,
00:05:15.460 he's put on trial before the Sanhedrin, theCouncil of Jewish leaders. And they
00:05:20.009 reject his claim to be the Messiah.They charge him with blasphemy against
00:05:23.949 God. Then Jesus is brought before theRoman governor, Pilate, and he thinks
00:05:28.770 Jesus is innocent, but he gives in to thepressure from the Jewish leaders and he
00:05:33.250 sentences Jesus to death by crucifixion.  So Jesus is led away by Roman soldiers and
00:05:38.599 then crucified. Now you'll notice righthere in this section that, just like
00:05:43.399 Matthew did in the opening chapters, heincreases the number of references to
00:05:47.529 the Old Testament. He's trying to showthat Jesus' death was not a tragedy or
00:05:52.689 failure. Rather, it was the surprisingfulfillment of all of the old, prophetic
00:05:57.819 promises. Jesus came as the ServantMessiah spoken of by Isaiah. He was
00:06:03.360 rejected by his own people but insteadof judging them, he is judged on their
00:06:08.490 behalf,
00:06:09.599 bearing the consequences of their sin.So the crucifixion scene, it comes to a
00:06:14.250 close, and Jesus' body is placed in atomb. But the book ends with a surprising
00:06:19.710 twist--the last chapter. The disciples,they discover on Sunday morning that
00:06:23.529 Jesus' tomb is empty. And then all of asudden people start seeing Jesus alive
00:06:29.680 from the dead. And the book concludes
00:06:32.200 with the risen Jesus giving a finalteaching called the Great Commission.
00:06:35.800 Jesus says that he is now the true kingof the world and so he sends his
00:06:41.000 disciples out to all nations with thegood news that Jesus is Lord and that
00:06:46.300 anyone can join his kingdom by beingbaptized and by following his teachings.
00:06:50.230 And echoing all the way back to his name,Emmanuel, God with us, from chapter one,
00:06:55.770 Jesus' last words in the book to hisdisciples are "I will be with you." It's a
00:07:00.980 promise of Jesus' presence until the dayhe finally returns. And that's the Gospel
00:07:06.970 according to Matthew.
