00:00:02.800 Paul's letter to the Ephesians.
00:00:05.220 The story of how Paul came to the city of Ephesus is really interesting.
00:00:08.520 You can go read about it in Acts chapter 19.
00:00:11.220 Ephesus was a huge city.
00:00:12.900 It was the epicenter of worship for most of the Greek and Roman gods.
00:00:16.239 For over two years, Paul had a really effective missionary presence there.
00:00:20.340 Lots of people became followers of Jesus.
00:00:22.640 Years later, after being imprisoned by the Romans, Paul wrote this letter.
00:00:27.640 The movement of thought in the letter divides into two really clear halves.
00:00:31.580 In the first half, Paul is exploring the story of the gospel,
00:00:34.940 how all history came to its climax, and Jesus,
00:00:38.660 and in his creation of this multi-ethnic community of his followers.
00:00:42.380 The second half of the letter is linked to the first by the word "therefore".
00:00:45.960 Here Paul explores how the gospel story should affect how we live
00:00:49.980 every part of our life story, personally, in our neighborhoods and communities and in our families.
00:00:55.840 So let's dive in and we can see how Paul develops all of this.
00:00:58.700 Chapter 1 opens with a beautiful Jewish style poem where Paul praises God the Father
00:01:04.420 for the amazing things that he has done in Christ Jesus.
00:01:08.570 From eternity past, the father has purposed to choose and bless a covenant people.
00:01:14.600 Think here the family of Abraham
00:01:16.760 and Genesis chapter 12 verses 1-3.
00:01:19.260 Through Jesus now, anyone can be adopted into that family.
00:01:23.000 Jesus's death covers our worst sins, our worse failures.
00:01:26.900 In Jesus, we find God's grace.
00:01:29.760 In fact, Paul says that grace has opened up a whole new way for us to understand every part of our lives.
00:01:36.800 He says, in chapter 1 verse 10, that God's purpose was to unify all things in heaven and on earth under Christ
00:01:44.500 which is a title that means Messiah.
00:01:46.500 God's plan was always to have a huge family of restored human beings who are unified in Jesus the Messiah.
00:01:52.980 This divine purpose became clear, Paul says, when we were first made into that family.
00:01:59.180 Here he is referring to ethnic Jews in the family of Abraham.
00:02:02.280 But then Paul talks about how you, and here he means non-Jews,
00:02:06.020 you all heard about Jesus and the salvation through him.
00:02:09.220 and you were also brought into this family by the work of the Holy Spirit.
00:02:13.720 Here he is referring to the events told in the stories of Acts about how God's Spirit
00:02:18.530 brought together Jew and non-Jew into one family in Jesus.
00:02:23.200 It is just like God promised to Abraham long ago.
00:02:25.940 Notice how in this poem Paul begins by talking about God the Father
00:02:30.580 but then about Jesus the Son and then, here the end, about the Spirit.
00:02:34.500 All three work together.
00:02:36.260 As Paul tells the story of the gospel. It is really cool.
00:02:39.340 After the poem, Paul responds with a prayer.
00:02:41.881 He prays that these followers of Jesus would not just know about, but personally experience, the power of the gospel,
00:02:49.100 that they would be energized by the same power that raised Jesus from the dead
00:02:52.860 and placed him as the exalted head of the whole world.
00:02:56.182 In chapter 2, Paul goes back and elaborates on some key ideas from the poem in chapter one,
00:03:01.700 especially God's grace and this new multi-ethnic family of Jesus
00:03:05.860 He begins by retelling the story of how these non-Jewish Christians came to know Jesus.
00:03:10.360 Before hearing about Jesus they were physically alive but they were spiritually dead.
00:03:15.340 They were trapped in a purposeless life of selfishness and sin.
00:03:19.200 They were deceived by dark, spiritual forces of evil.
00:03:22.660 But, amazingly, God in his great love and mercy, he saved them.
00:03:26.726 He forgave all of their sins and he joined their lives to Jesus' resurrection life.
00:03:32.449 He brought them back to life, too.
00:03:34.500 So now, having been created as new human beings through Jesus,
00:03:38.820 they have the joy of discovering all of the new calling and purposes and tasks that God has set before them.
00:03:45.320 Not only have they been shown God's grace, they have also been invited into a new family.
00:03:50.420 Before hearing about Jesus, these non-Jewish people were not just cut off from God,
00:03:54.703 they were cut off from his covenant people, the family of Abraham, and for a really practical reason.
00:04:00.000 The commands of the Sinai covenant formed like a boundary line around the family.
00:04:04.660 They were like a barrier that kept most non-Jewish people away.
00:04:08.307 But in Jesus, the laws of the Torah have been fulfilled and the barrier is removed.
00:04:13.760 The two ethnic groups have become, as Paul puts it, "A new unified humanity that can live together in peace."
00:04:20.560 Paul goes on in chapter 3 to marvel at the unique role that he got to have
00:04:25.480 in spreading this good news to non-Jewish people.
00:04:28.220 Even though he is in prison, he is thanking God for the chance he has had to see this covenant family grow so huge.
00:04:34.740 So Paul closes the first half of the letter with another prayer.
00:04:37.820 This time he prays that Jesus' followers would be strengthened by God's Spirit to simply grasp and comprehend
00:04:45.270 the love that Christ has for his people.
00:04:48.140 The second half of the letter begins with Paul shifting gears.
00:04:51.420 He starts challenging the reader to respond to the Gospel story by how they live their own life story.
00:04:57.720 He starts in chapter 4 with just the everyday life of the church.
00:05:01.300 The church is a big family with lots of different kinds of people.
00:05:04.920 But he emphasizes that they are one.
00:05:07.740 One is a key word in this chapter.
00:05:09.660 They are one body that is unified by one Spirit.
00:05:12.600 They have one Lord with one faith.
00:05:14.780 They have one baptism. They believe in one God.
00:05:17.640 It is a lot of unity.
00:05:19.660 However, Paul says unity is not the same thing as uniformity.
00:05:24.220 He goes on to explore how Jesus' new family consists of lots of very different kinds of people
00:05:30.360 but they are all empowered by the one Holy Spirit, each using their unique talents and passions to serve
00:05:36.380 and to love each other, and to build up the church.
00:05:39.700 Here he uses two really cool metaphors.
00:05:41.880 One is building up the church as a new temple.
00:05:45.080 The second is that they are all becoming a new humanity with Jesus as the head.
00:05:50.420 This new humanity is a metaphor he is then going to run with for the next couple chapters.
00:05:54.540 Paul challenges every Christian to take off their old humanity like a set of old clothes
00:05:59.780 and to put on their new humanity in which the image of God is being restored.
00:06:04.620 He then goes on into this long section where he compares this new and old humanity.
00:06:09.520 Instead of lying, new humans speak truth.
00:06:13.620 Instead of harboring, anger they peacefully resolve their conflicts.
00:06:17.540 Instead of stealing, new humans are generous.
00:06:20.780 Instead of gossiping, they encourage people with their words.
00:06:24.220 Instead of getting revenge, new humans forgive.
00:06:27.500 Instead of gratifying every sexual impulse new humans cultivate self control of their bodily desires.
00:06:34.680 Instead of getting drunk, new humans come under the influence of God's Spirit.
00:06:40.020 He spells out what that influence looks like in four different ways.
00:06:43.900 The first two have to do with singing.
00:06:45.700 Singing together but also singing alone.
00:06:48.220 This is really interesting that the first thing that Paul thinks of
00:06:51.227 about how the Spirit works in the lives of Jesus' people is singing and music.
00:06:56.440 The third sign of the Spirit's influence is being thankful for everything.
00:07:00.460 And the fourth is that the Spirit will compel Jesus' followers
00:07:03.580 to put themselves underneath others and to elevate others as more important than themselves.
00:07:10.940 Paul actually expands on this fourth point by showing how it works in Christian marriage.
00:07:17.200 You have a wife who follows Jesus. She is called to respect and allow
00:07:21.760 her husband to become responsible for her.
00:07:24.160 The husband is called to love his wife and to use his responsibility to lay down his selfish agenda
00:07:31.900 to prioritize his wife's well-being above his own.
00:07:34.960 Paul says it is this kind of marriage that is actually reenacting the gospel story.
00:07:40.500 The husband's actions mimic Jesus and his love and self-sacrifice.
00:07:45.020 The wise actions mimic the church which allows Jesus to love her and to make her new.
00:07:50.400 Paul then applies the same idea to children and parents as well as slaves and masters.
00:07:56.020 Paul closes out the letter by reminding these Christians of the reality of spiritual evil.
00:08:01.880 These are beings and forces that will try to undermine the unity of Jesus' people
00:08:06.940 and to compromise their new humanity.
00:08:09.400 So Paul challenges them to stand firm and to put on this metaphorical set of body armor
00:08:14.860 which he describes in detail.
00:08:17.410 Paul has drawn all of these pieces of body armor from the book of Isaiah
00:08:21.560 and how Isaiah depicted the messianic king.
00:08:24.220 Now, as the Messiah's followers, we need to make the Messiah's attributes our own,
00:08:29.540 since we make up Jesus' body.
00:08:31.420 Practically I think Paul means for Christians to begin to form habits,
00:08:35.980 proactively using prayer, the Scriptures and our relationships with each other
00:08:40.240 to help us grow and mature as followers of Jesus.
00:08:43.466 That is the letter to the Ephesians
00:08:46.244 Very powerful.
00:08:47.320 It is where Paul summarizes the whole gospel story and how it should reshape every part of our life story.
