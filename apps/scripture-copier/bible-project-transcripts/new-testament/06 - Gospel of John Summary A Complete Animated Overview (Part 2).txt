00:00:03.654 The Gospel According to John.
00:00:05.702 In the first video, we saw thatJohn wrote this book to make the claim
00:00:09.224 that Jesus is the Messiah, the Sonof God, the human embodiment of God's Word
00:00:14.447 and glorious presence who hascome to reveal who God truly is.
00:00:18.671 Then we explored how Johndesigned the first half of the book
00:00:21.393 to demonstrate this claim.
00:00:22.785 Jesus performed miraculous signsand make huge claims about himself
00:00:27.035 that He is the realityto which Israel's entire history points.
00:00:31.155 And this all generates controversy ; however,
00:00:33.625 and the Jewish leadersconfront Jesus for all these claims.
00:00:36.766 And it culminated with Jesus layingdown His life for His friend Lazarus;
00:00:41.016 by going near Jerusalem to raisehim from the dead.  Jesus sealed His fate.
00:00:45.841 And so once the plot to murder Jesus is setin motion we come into the book's second half.
00:00:50.311 The first part focusesentirely on Jesus' final night
00:00:53.601 and last words to the disciples as Hetries to prepare them for His coming death.
00:00:58.171 Jesus performs the shocking act at dinner:
00:01:01.011 He takes on the role of a common servantby kneeling down to wash their dirty feet;
00:01:05.931 something that in their culture a superiorrabbi would never do for his disciples.
00:01:10.294 And Jesus says it'sa symbol of His entire life purpose:
00:01:14.550 to reveal the true natureof God as a being of self giving love.
00:01:19.770 And it's also a symbol of what Jesusis about to do in becoming a servant
00:01:24.241 and giving up His lifeto die for the sins of the world.
00:01:27.430 And so this act leads to Hisgreat command to His disciples
00:01:31.433 that they are to follow Him byloving one another as He has loved them.
00:01:36.533 Acts of loving generosity areto be the hallmark of Jesus's followers:
00:01:41.851 this is what will show the worldwho Jesus is and therefore who God is.
00:01:46.979 And from here Jesus goes into a longflowing speech that's concluded with a prayer.
00:01:51.756 And you'll find the whole thingis unified by a few repeated themes.
00:01:55.743 Jesus keep saying that He's goingaway, which makes the disciples sad,
00:01:59.940 but Jesus says it's forthe best because it means
00:02:02.472 that He will send the Spirit,also known as The Advocate.
00:02:06.062 As a human Jesus canonly be in one place at a time,
00:02:09.292 but the Spirit can be Jesus' divinepersonal presence in any place at any time.
00:02:15.242 And the Spirit will doa number of things, Jesus says.
00:02:18.327 So remember for John,the unique deity of the One God
00:02:21.967 consists of that loving unified relation-ship between the Father and the Son.
00:02:26.587 Jesus says the Spirit isthat loving personal presence
00:02:30.757 that will come to live in His people
00:02:33.017 and draw them into the lovebetween the Father and the Son.
00:02:37.187 And so Jesus saysHis disciples are the ones
00:02:39.997 who abide or remain in that divine love.
00:02:43.638 The way the branchesare connected to a vine.
00:02:46.219 He's describing here how the personallove of God can permeate a person's life,
00:02:50.769 healing, transformingand making them new, and there's more.
00:02:54.672 The Spirit will alsoempower Jesus' followers
00:02:57.532 to carry on His mission in the world,
00:03:00.002 to first of all fulfillthe Great command to love others
00:03:03.032 through radical acts of service.
00:03:04.754 But also Jesus says the mission isto bear witness to the truth,
00:03:09.044 to expose and name the selfish sinfulways that we as humans treat each other
00:03:14.464 and to declare that in JesusGod has saved the world
00:03:18.464 through Him because He loves it.
00:03:20.944 He's opened up a newway to become human again.
00:03:23.894 And so finally Jesus predictsthat there will be opposition,
00:03:26.984 just as the Jewish leaders rejectedHim, so his followers will be persecuted.
00:03:31.778 But He tells them not to be afraidbecause He has already conquered
00:03:35.601 or gain victory over the world.
00:03:38.041 Now, what does Jesus meanby victory here? He doesn't say.
00:03:42.241 But it leads us intothe final section of the book
00:03:44.431 where John shows uswhat victory looks like: Jesus' style.
00:03:48.440 The Jewish leaders sent soldiersto Jesus and His disciples to arrest Him.
00:03:52.658 And when the soldiersask which one Jesus is
00:03:55.078 He declares: "I am"and they fall backward.
00:03:58.973 Now this is brilliant on John's part:
00:04:01.013 these words are the culminationof two sets of seven instances
00:04:04.876 where Jesus has used that very phrase.
00:04:07.771 And it all highlights oneof John's core claims about Jesus.
00:04:11.131 The words "I am" are in Greek 'ego eimi',
00:04:14.029 the greek translation of theHebrew personal covenant name of God
00:04:17.755 that was revealedto Moses back in Exodus chapter 3.
00:04:20.995 It was also repeated many times in Isaiah.
00:04:23.365 And John has strategicallyplaced seven moments in his story
00:04:27.245 where Jesus says: "I Am"followed by some astounding claim:
00:04:31.515 "I am the bread of life;I am the light of the world;
00:04:35.105 the gate for the Sheep;the Good Shepherd; the resurrection;
00:04:39.155 the way, the truthand the life; The True Vine."
00:04:42.288 And John's also designed sevenother stories that have key moments
00:04:45.798 where Jesus says simplyI am, echoing this divine name.
00:04:49.820 And so here, thisoccurrence, as Jesus is arrested,
00:04:52.630 is the ironic climax of all of thembecause Jesus reveals His divine name
00:04:58.260 and power and victory preciselyat the moment that He gives up His life.
00:05:03.275 After this, Jesus is puton trial for His exalted claims
00:05:06.275 to be the Son of Godand the King of Israel:
00:05:08.705 first before the high priests,and then before the Roman governor Pilate
00:05:12.395 who has to take seriously anyone
00:05:14.305 who's chargedwith claiming to be the king of Israel.
00:05:16.835 And Jesus tells Pilate that:"My Kingdom is not from this world,"
00:05:22.013 meaning that He is a king,and His Kingdom is for this world,
00:05:25.943 but its radically different valuesystem; its redefinition of power
00:05:30.143 and greatness; none of thisis derived from this world.
00:05:33.903 Rather,  they are defined by God'scharacter that Jesus has revealed
00:05:37.903 through His upside downKingdom, which is epitomized by the cross.
00:05:43.042 It's the place wherethe world's true King conquer sin
00:05:46.632 and evil by letting it conquer him.
00:05:49.282 And Jesus gains victory over theworld through an act of self-giving love.
00:05:54.327 After this, Jesus body is placedin a tomb that is then sealed.
00:05:58.518 And on the first day of the week, Mary,and then later the other disciples discover
00:06:02.758 that the tomb isstrangely open and then empty.
00:06:05.965 And then Mary,all of a sudden, she meets Jesus.
00:06:08.455 He's alive from the dead.
00:06:10.494 Now, the resurrection of Jesus connects backto another pattern of sevens in John's Gospel
00:06:15.514 to all the way backat the wedding party in Cana
00:06:18.014 when Jesus turned the water into wine.
00:06:20.387 John told usthat that was Jesus' first sign.
00:06:23.783 And he also identified the second signthe healing of the sick boy in chapter 4.
00:06:28.490 But after this, John just letsyou keep count, and if you have,
00:06:32.110 you'll have noticed that the sixth signwas the raising of Lazarus from the tomb
00:06:36.690 which Jesus performedat the cost of His own life.
00:06:40.073 And so that, and all of the signs,they point forward to this seventh
00:06:44.233 and greatest sign at theculmination of the story:
00:06:46.983 Jesus' own resurrection from the dead.
00:06:49.953 It vindicates Jesus' claim to bethe Son of God, the author of all life,
00:06:55.523 whose love has conquered death itself.
00:06:58.373 After the empty tomb, Jesusthen meets up with all the disciples
00:07:01.693 and He commissions themby sending the Spirit as he promised.
00:07:05.018 so that His mission from the Fathercan now be carried on through them.
00:07:08.812 After this the bookconcludes with an epilogue
00:07:11.302 that explores the ongoingmission of Jesus' disciples in the world.
00:07:15.582 So, a number of them are fishingand they're not catching anything.
00:07:19.562 And so Jesus appears to them on theshore; they don't recognize Him though.
00:07:23.905 And he tells them to cast theirnet on the other side of the boat.
00:07:27.085 And when they obey Himthey catch a huge amount of fish
00:07:30.365 and it's only then that theyrecognize Him as Jesus.
00:07:33.755 Now John is offering herea picture of discipleship to Jesus:
00:07:37.849 His followers will bemost effective in the world
00:07:40.819 when their focusis not on their work as such,
00:07:44.049 but on simply listening for Jesus'voice and obeying Him when He speaks;
00:07:48.639 that's when they will trulysee Him at work in their lives.
00:07:52.009 After this, Jesus talks withPeter and then commissions him
00:07:55.169 as a unique leader in the Jesus Movement
00:07:57.409 indicating that he, too,will give up his life one day.
00:08:00.764 But in contrast to Peter,the last moments of the story focus
00:08:04.034 on the author of this gospel:the disciple whom Jesus loved.
00:08:08.621 And unlike Peter, his job wasnot to lead the Jesus Movement,
00:08:11.941 but rather, to spend his longlife bearing witness to Jesus
00:08:15.851 so that others might believe in Him.
00:08:18.658 And that's actuallywhat he's done right here
00:08:20.878 by authoring this amazing storyabout Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God.
00:08:26.725 And that whatthe Gospel of John is all about.
