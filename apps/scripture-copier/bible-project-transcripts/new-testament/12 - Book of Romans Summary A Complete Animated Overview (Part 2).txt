00:00:03.284 Paul's letter to the Romans.
00:00:04.919 Check out the first video
00:00:06.129 where we explored who Paul was,
00:00:07.959 why he wrote this letter
00:00:09.349 and where we trace the coreideas of chapters one through four:
00:00:12.299 that all humanity ishopelessly trapped in sin
00:00:14.959 and needs to be rescued.
00:00:16.599 That this rescue is notgoing to happen by people
00:00:18.959 trying to obey the laws of the Torah.
00:00:20.939 Rather God's righteouscharacter has moved him
00:00:23.269 to rescue the world throughJesus' death and resurrection
00:00:27.069 so that He could create a faith-based
00:00:29.789 multi-ethnic family ofAbraham as His people.
00:00:33.045 Now in the remaining threemovements of the letter to the Romans
00:00:35.815 Paul is going to developthese ideas even more.
00:00:38.881 So remember Paul'sexploration of justification by faith
00:00:43.201 that when people trust Jesus'sdeath and resurrection was for them
00:00:47.231 they're given a newstatus, the right with God,
00:00:50.021 they're placed in a new family,the covenant people of Abraham,
00:00:53.221 and they're given a new future:the hope of a transformed life.
00:00:57.428 Now Paul wants to show how this realityshould reshape every part of our existence
00:01:02.108 because being in this familymeans being a part of a new humanity
00:01:06.408 that God is creatingthrough Jesus and the Spirit.
00:01:09.512 So Paul goes back to the first humancharacter of the Biblical story, Adam.
00:01:13.838 His name means humanity
00:01:15.448 and Adam like all humanity after him
00:01:17.818 has chosen sin and selfishness
00:01:20.098 and so everyone faces God's judgment
00:01:22.908 because we become slaves tosins influence resulting in death.
00:01:26.971 But then Paul contrast Adam with Jesus
00:01:29.851 who He says is the new Adam,
00:01:32.201 a human who livedin faithful obedience to God
00:01:36.021 shown through His act of sacrificial love
00:01:38.301 and now Jesus offersHis life as a gift to others
00:01:41.771 so that they can be justified before God.
00:01:44.463 And so Jesus stands asthe head of a new humanity
00:01:47.723 that is being transformed by this gift
00:01:50.383 which leads him to chapter 6.
00:01:52.121 Paul reminds these Christians in Rome
00:01:54.171 that choosing to follow Jesus meansleaving their old Adam-like humanity
00:01:59.291 and entering into thenew Jesus-like humanity.
00:02:02.750 And their baptism was asacred symbol of that transition.
00:02:06.393 Their old humanity died with Jesus
00:02:09.013 and their new humanity wasraised with Him from the dead.
00:02:12.683 So when a person trust in Jesus
00:02:14.613 their life becomes joined to His life,
00:02:17.203 what's true of Him is now true of them.
00:02:20.419 It's when people accepttheir identity as Jesus-like humans
00:02:24.769 that they are liberated tobecome the wholehearted humans
00:02:28.489 who can truly love God and their neighbor.
00:02:31.122 Now, if creating this newhumanity was always God's purpose
00:02:34.762 Paul asks in Chapter seven
00:02:36.592 what then was the pointof God giving Israel the law
00:02:39.952 or in Hebrew the Torah?
00:02:41.932 Now side note:when Paul uses this word law
00:02:45.133 he sometimes means the storyline
00:02:47.853 and message of thefirst five books of the Bible.
00:02:50.431 But other times he's more specificallyreferring to the hundreds of commands
00:02:54.547 given through Moses
00:02:55.727 and that are found in the Torah.
00:02:57.667 The second meaning is Paul's focus here
00:03:00.037 what was the purposeof all those commands?
00:03:02.738 Paul says that thecommands of the Torah were good,
00:03:05.708 they showed God's willfor how Israel was to live.
00:03:09.020 But, if you read thestory line of the Torah
00:03:12.050 Israel broke all those commands:
00:03:13.784 the more laws Israel received,
00:03:15.544 the more they replayedthe sin of Adam and rebelled.
00:03:18.344 So even when God gave Hispeople specific moral rules to obey
00:03:22.124 that did not fix theproblem of the sinful human heart.
00:03:25.724 And so paradoxically these rulesmade Israel even more guilty.
00:03:30.160 But Paul says that paradox is the point.
00:03:33.381 God's goal was to make it crystal clear
00:03:35.671 that it's evil that's hijack the human heart
00:03:38.521 and that the Torah good as itis could not do a thing about it.
00:03:42.801 But Paul says in chaptereight the solution has arrived
00:03:45.561 in Jesus and the Spirit.
00:03:47.503 And here's how:
00:03:48.613 the commands of the Torahacted like a magnifying glass,
00:03:51.944 it focused the problem of thehuman condition into into one place,
00:03:55.544 on the people of Israel.
00:03:57.144 But now, Israel's repre-sentative Jesus, the Messiah,
00:04:00.604 has paid for anddealt with all of that sin
00:04:04.024 through His death and His resurrection.
00:04:06.695 And now Jesus has releasedHis Spirit into His new family
00:04:10.855 to transform their hearts
00:04:12.365 So that they can truly fulfill thecall of all the Torah's commands
00:04:16.925 to love God and neighbor.
00:04:19.202 And there's more:
00:04:20.291 God's renewal of human beingsis the first step of His larger mission
00:04:24.292 to rescue and renew all of creation
00:04:27.142 making it a place whereHis love gets the final word.
00:04:30.772 Now you can see how chapters onethrough eight are long flowy thought here.
00:04:35.533 But it raises some other questions:
00:04:37.363 if all of this was God's purpose
00:04:39.814 what is the current statusthen of Paul's fellow Israelites
00:04:43.214 who don't acknowledgeJesus as the Messiah?
00:04:45.664 How does this story fulfillGod's promises to them?
00:04:49.036 Paul begins in chapter nine withhis own anguish over fellow Israelites
00:04:53.236 who don't think Jesus is their Messiah.
00:04:55.708 And it leads him toreflect on Israel in the past
00:04:58.558 from the Old Testament story.
00:05:00.264 And he reminds usthat simply being an ethnic Israelite,
00:05:03.934 a physical descendant of Abraham,
00:05:05.464 never made one automatically
00:05:07.454 a faithful member of the Covenant family.
00:05:09.814 Paul shows us how God has alwaysselected a subset from Abraham's family
00:05:14.534 to carry on the line of promise.
00:05:16.854 In this point is that now thatline of promise is carried on
00:05:20.474 by those who follow Jesus.
00:05:22.884 He reminds us that for a long time
00:05:24.754 people inside and outsideAbraham's family have rejected God's will.
00:05:29.440 He reminds us of thestory of Israel in the golden calf
00:05:32.240 and of Pharaohs rebellion.
00:05:34.393 He shows us how God wasable to orchestrate events
00:05:37.153 so that people's rejection of Him
00:05:39.163 actually accomplishedHis redemptive purposes.
00:05:42.327 And so in chapter ten Paul turnshis focus to israel in the present;
00:05:46.087 the reason manyIsraelites reject Jesus is
00:05:48.637 because they're basing theircovenant relationship with God
00:05:51.277 on their performanceof the commands in the Torah.
00:05:54.101 And so sadly they don't recognize
00:05:55.881 what God has done through Jesus
00:05:57.341 to create a new covenantfamily on the basis of faith.
00:06:00.918 And so paul asks inchapter 11 what is Israel's future?
00:06:04.925 Has God written off His people?
00:06:06.895 No, he says.
00:06:08.339 There are tons of Jewishpeople, including himself,
00:06:11.070 who do recognize Jesus as their Messiah
00:06:13.830 but there are also a lot who don't.
00:06:16.160 But God has been able to usetheir rejection for His own purposes.
00:06:20.050 it's cause the gospel to spread evenquicker and farther into the gentile world
00:06:24.600 making the family of Abrahameven larger and more multi-ethnic.
00:06:28.474 Paul describes God'scovenant family as a big olive tree
00:06:32.134 and the rejecters of Jesushave been broken off so to speak
00:06:35.614 and these Gentiles are like wild branches
00:06:38.204 that have beengrafted into the family tree.
00:06:41.032 However, Paul says, one day Jesuswill be acknowledged by His own people.
00:06:46.082 He doesn't offer any details about how.
00:06:49.082 Paul simply trust God'scharacter and promise
00:06:51.882 that he won't give upon His covenant people.
00:06:55.093 Which transitions into the finalsection of the book, chapters 12 to 16.
00:06:59.127 But remember the big picture:
00:07:00.557 because of their faith in Jesus
00:07:02.287 Jews and Gentiles are nowtogether Abraham's family
00:07:05.894 that new humanity that'sbeing transformed by God's Spirit
00:07:09.895 And so this is how God'sfulfilling His ancient promises.
00:07:13.915 Therefore the only reasonable response
00:07:16.305 is for these Jews and non-jewishChristians to be unified as the church.
00:07:21.885 In chapter 12 to 13 heshows that this unity will come
00:07:25.355 from a commitment tolove and forgive each other.
00:07:28.634 Love will look like everybodyusing their diverse gifts and talents
00:07:32.434 to serve one another in the church.
00:07:34.914 And will also meanhumility and forgiveness;
00:07:37.864 when these different ethnic groups
00:07:39.514 and cultures come together in Jesus
00:07:41.974 conflict is inevitable.
00:07:43.796 And it can only be overcome
00:07:45.326 through the hard work offorgiveness and reconciliation.
00:07:48.769 This is how they will show thegreatest of Christian virtues, love,
00:07:53.979 which fulfills theThora's greatest commands
00:07:56.421 to love God and loveyour neighbor as yourself.
00:07:59.778 In chapter 14 and 15 hefocuses specifically on the issues
00:08:03.308 that are creating ethnicdivisions in the Roman Church.
00:08:06.507 These are disputes about theJewish food laws and the Sabbath.
00:08:09.937 And Paul says, thesepractices don't define
00:08:12.867 who's in or out of Jesus' family.
00:08:15.620 And people differ overthese culturally important
00:08:18.700 but non-essential issues
00:08:20.580 they need to learn how torespect each other's differences.
00:08:23.655 And it's in this way that lovewill heal and unify Jesus' family.
00:08:29.086 Paul closes the letter byfirst committing Phobe
00:08:31.746 who's a key leaderin the church of Cenchrea.
00:08:34.256 She had the honor of carrying andperhaps even reading this letter aloud
00:08:38.206 to the Roman churches for the first time.
00:08:40.424 Paul then concludeby greeting all the people
00:08:42.374 that he hasn't seen for a long time
00:08:44.094 and that's the end.
00:08:47.251 You can see better now how allthe pieces of this letter fit together
00:08:50.581 and show what aprofound masterpiece it truely is.
00:08:55.048 That's what the letter tothe Romans is all about.
