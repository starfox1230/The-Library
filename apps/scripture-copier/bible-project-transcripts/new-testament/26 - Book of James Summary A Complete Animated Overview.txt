# https://www.youtube.com/watch/qn-hLHWwRYY

00:00:02.700 The letter of James, or at least that's his name in English.
00:00:06.600 If you look in the Greek you will see that his name is Iakobos,
00:00:10.080 which translates his Hebrew name YÃ¡akov.
00:00:12.740 And that's why most ancient and modern translations render his name as Jacob.
00:00:17.660 That's how we're going to call him in this video.
00:00:19.880 Now, there are many Jacobs in the New Testament.
00:00:21.940 Two of them belonged to Jesus' inner circle of the 12 disciples,
00:00:25.460 but this letter comes from the Jacob who was the half-brother of Jesus himself.
00:00:30.080 Now, we learned this Jacob's story from the book of Acts and from Paul's letters.
00:00:34.340 After Peter moved on from Jerusalem to go start new churches
00:00:38.160 Jesus' half-brother Jacob rose to prominence as a leader in the Mother Church in Jerusalem.
00:00:43.720 It was made up mostly of Messianic or Christian Jews.
00:00:46.740 This was the first Christian community ever.
00:00:49.360 And we know that it fell on hard times during the 20 years that Jacob was its leader.
00:00:54.100 There was a famine that led to great poverty in the region
00:00:57.320 and these Messianic Jews were being persecuted by Jewish leaders in Jerusalem.
00:01:01.540 But through it all Jacob was known as a pillar of the Jerusalem church.
00:01:05.720 He was also known as a peacemaker who led with wisdom and courage
00:01:09.680 until he was tragically murdered.
00:01:11.520 And in this book we have the legacy of Jacob's teaching and wisdom
00:01:15.020 condensed into a short and very powerful work.
00:01:18.680 The book begins like a letter. He greets all the Messianic Jews who were living outside the Land of Israel.
00:01:24.000 But this does not read like one of Paul's letters where he addresses specific problems in one local church,
00:01:29.980 rather this book is a summary of Jacob's sage wisdom
00:01:33.920 for any and every community of Jesus' followers.
00:01:37.080 And Jacob's goal isn't to teach new theological information,
00:01:40.840 rather he wants to get in your business and challenge how you live.
00:01:44.960 Jacob's wisdom has been heavily influenced by two sources:
00:01:48.200 The first is Jesus' teaching about life in the kingdom of God.
00:01:51.800 Especially the Sermon on the Mount which is constantly echoing and quoting in the book.
00:01:56.480 The second key influence is the biblical wisdom book of Proverbs.
00:01:59.960 Especially the poems and proverbs one through nine.
00:02:03.040 Jacob literally grew up with Jesus and with the book of Proverbs
00:02:07.080 and so now his own teaching sounds like them. It's stamped by their language and imagery.
00:02:11.980 The book consists of short challenging wisdom speeches
00:02:15.380 that are full of metaphors and easy to memorize one-liners.
00:02:18.920 And in essence Jacob is calling the Messianic community to become truly wise
00:02:24.180 by living according to Jesus' summary of the Torah:
00:02:27.480 To love God and to love your neighbor as yourself.
00:02:30.600 The body of the book is in chapters 2 through 5.
00:02:33.380 Which consists of 12 short teachings that call God's people to wholehearted devotion to the way of Jesus.
00:02:40.220 And altogether they don't develop one main idea in a linear way.
00:02:44.820 Each teaching kind of stands alone and concludes with a catchy one-liner,
00:02:48.940 but all of these teachings are connected through key repeated words and themes - it's really cool.
00:02:54.580 At the opening of the books body there are two teachings:
00:02:57.900 First about favoritism and love
00:03:00.280 Jacob exposes how we tend to show favor to people who can benefit us
00:03:04.780 and we neglect people who can't. Usually because they're needy.
00:03:08.300 Jacob says this is the opposite of love as Jesus defined it.
00:03:12.200 He goes on to show what genuine faith does and does not look like.
00:03:16.260 So, if someone says that they have faith in God, but neglects people who are needy or poor,
00:03:21.920 this person's faith is dead, he says.
00:03:25.140 Their actions betray what they say they believe.
00:03:27.820 And genuine faith always results in obedience to Jesus' teachings.
00:03:33.000 Now scattered throughout the body of the book we find three different places
00:03:36.560 where Jacob develops Jesus' own teaching about our words.
00:03:40.620 So, with the same mouth we unleash pain upon people
00:03:44.140 and then go offer praise to God - so messed up!
00:03:47.600 And also we judge people and then go talk badly about them behind their backs!
00:03:52.160 And we also all tend to distort the truth to our own advantage.
00:03:56.170 How we talk about people opens up a window into our hearts and our core values.
00:04:01.500 Our words tell the real truth about our character.
00:04:04.660 Jacob also believes that God's kingdom community, as Jesus taught about it,
00:04:09.040 Is the kind of place where the divisions created by wealth and social status are dismantled.
00:04:14.740 So, he warns first about the arrogance that wealth can create in people
00:04:19.300 who believe it will be around forever.
00:04:21.940 He says: "No, your wealth will one day rot just like you."
00:04:26.660 In contrast, God's people are to live with patience and hope
00:04:31.280 for Jesus' return to set all things right
00:04:34.060 and this should inspire a life of faith-filled prayer.
00:04:38.400 Now, this part of the book, all of these teachings,
00:04:40.620 they're so powerful and there's way more than we have time for in this video,
00:04:45.180 but, seriously, read all of them and slowly.
00:04:48.160 Now, placed in front of these 12 wise teachings is the introductory chapter.
00:04:52.760 It's a flowing stream of wise teachings and one-liners.
00:04:55.980 And they're designed to sum up the main ideas of the entire book.
00:04:59.690 this chapter actually introduces you to
00:05:01.640 all the key words and themes that you're going to meet in chapters 2 through 5.
00:05:05.500 Jacob opens by saying that he knows from personal experience -
00:05:08.800 Life is hard.
00:05:10.420 He was martyred after all, not long after writing this letter.
00:05:13.480 But he believes that life's trials and hardships are actually paradoxical gifts
00:05:18.640 that can produce endurance and shape our character.
00:05:21.420 God can do amazing work inside of us in the midst of suffering
00:05:25.700 and help us become perfect and complete.
00:05:28.660 Now, that word "perfect" it's really important for Jacob.
00:05:31.960 He repeats it seven times in the book.
00:05:34.300 In Biblical Hebrew and in Greek this word refers to wholeness.
00:05:38.480 It means living a completely integrated life where your actions are always consistent
00:05:43.520 with the values and beliefs that you've received from Jesus.
00:05:46.360 Jacob knows that most of us actually live as fractured people with big inconsistencies in our character.
00:05:52.720 we are all more compromised than we want to admit.
00:05:55.520 However, God is on a mission to restore fractured people to make them whole.
00:06:00.540 And it begins with wisdom - the ability to see my hardships through a new perspective.
00:06:05.260 God will generously give this kind of wisdom to people who ask for it in faith,
00:06:10.260 without doubting God's character.
00:06:12.400 And when we realize our humble and frail place before God we are forced to choose between anxiety or trust.
00:06:20.000 And true wisdom means choosing to believe that God is good despite my circumstances.
00:06:25.780 So, if it's poverty that's forcing you into hard times in life
00:06:29.480 Jacob says: "Try and view it as a gift that forces you to trust in God alone."
00:06:34.620 And besides wealth is fleeting it's all going to pass away like wildflowers in the summer heat.
00:06:39.920 And so when we do fall into hard times don't accuse God,
00:06:43.360 rather let your circumstances teach you what Jesus taught about God's character,
00:06:48.100 that the father is generous, that he's there to meet us in our pain and that he's trustworthy.
00:06:54.080 It's this God who through Jesus has given us new birth to become new kinds of humans,
00:06:59.680 who can face their suffering with total trust in the father just like Jesus did.
00:07:04.620 And this new humanity is something we discover when we not only listen to God's Word but do what it says.
00:07:10.800 Jacob calls God's Word here "The perfect Torah of freedom."
00:07:14.640 He's referring here to the greatest command of the Torah that passed on to us through Jesus.
00:07:19.280 That he freed us to love God and love our neighbor.
00:07:22.520 And Jacob shows practically what that kind of love looks like.
00:07:26.140 It means speaking to others in a kind and loving way, it means serving the poor
00:07:30.860 and it means living with wholehearted devotion to God alone.
00:07:34.460 Now you can see how this opening chapter contains all the key words and ideas
00:07:38.380 explored more deeply in the twelve teachings of chapters 2 through 5.
00:07:42.360 Jacob immersed himself in the wisdom of Jesus and of the proverbs.
00:07:46.720 And he's giving us a great gift in this book of his own wisdom.
00:07:51.220 This is a beautifully crafted punch in the gut for those who want to follow Jesus.
00:07:57.000 And that is what the book of James or Jacob is all about.
