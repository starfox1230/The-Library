00:00:03.715 Paul second letter to the Corinthians.
00:00:05.798 Even though it's called "secondor two Corinthians" in our Bibles,
00:00:08.988 there are multipleclues within this letter
00:00:11.048 that it's not the second thing he everwrote to the church of ancient Corinth.
00:00:14.877 Paul started this Jesuscommunity in Corinth
00:00:17.167 sometime ago on oneof his missionary journeys
00:00:19.667 (you can read the story inthe book of Acts chapter 18).
00:00:22.557 And after moving on Paul got a report
00:00:24.797 that things were not going well there.
00:00:27.161 So he wrote the letterthat we call "first Corinthians"
00:00:29.641 to correct these problems.
00:00:31.191 And it appearsthat many in the church
00:00:33.311 rejected Paul'steaching in that letter
00:00:35.231 and rebelled against his authority.
00:00:37.091 And so we learned in this letter
00:00:38.631 that Paul had followed up in person
00:00:40.671 with what he calls "the painful visit"
00:00:42.851 and after that he sent a letter
00:00:44.431 which he says waswritten with anguish and tears.
00:00:47.424 And so after all these measures
00:00:49.298 most, but not all, of theCorinthians realize their arrogance
00:00:52.308 and they apologized to Paul,
00:00:54.078 they wanted to reconcile.
00:00:55.885 And so Paul wrote this letter
00:00:57.275 to assure them of hislove and commitment.
00:01:00.135 The letter's been designedwith three main sections
00:01:02.495 each addressing a distinct topic.
00:01:04.470 So Paul first finalizes hisreconciliation with the Corinthians.
00:01:08.260 then in chapters 8 and 9 he addressesthe topic of forgotten generosity,
00:01:12.096 and in the final chapters Paulchallenges the remaining Corinthians
00:01:15.606 who still reject him.
00:01:17.107 Let's dive in andyou'll see how it all works.
00:01:19.439 So Paul opens up by thanking the"God of all mercy and comfort"
00:01:23.169 who brought peaceand encouragement to him
00:01:25.149 and the Corinthians duringthis time of division and dispute.
00:01:28.524 He acknowledges that thingshave been tense since his painful visit,
00:01:31.714 and he makes clear
00:01:32.954 he's forgiven them,
00:01:33.904 he wants an openand honest relationship.
00:01:36.703 But why had theyrejected Paul in the first place?
00:01:39.222 Will be discovered later in this letter
00:01:41.062 that the Corinthians haddisregarded Paul as a leader:
00:01:44.372 he was poor
00:01:45.262 he earned a meagerliving through manual labor;
00:01:47.832 he was under constantpersecution and suffering,
00:01:50.082 he was often homeless
00:01:51.232 and the top it off, he wasn'ta very impressive public speaker.
00:01:54.652 And so once the corinthians were exposed
00:01:56.682 to other, more wealthyimpressive Christian leaders,
00:01:59.662 they started to think less of Paul,
00:02:01.592 they were actually ashamed of him.
00:02:03.402 So Paul response first by showing
00:02:05.272 that their elevationof these leaders simply
00:02:07.572 because of their wealth andeloquence is a betrayal of Jesus
00:02:11.482 it shows a totally distorted value system.
00:02:14.172 "True Christian Leadership," Paul says,
00:02:16.402 "is not about status or self-promotion:"
00:02:19.787 Paul depicts himselfand the other apostles
00:02:22.467 as captives slaves to King Jesus
00:02:24.907 who's leading them on aprocession of triumph.
00:02:28.004 Paul's job isn't to be impressive,
00:02:29.934 but rather to point peopleto the one who is: Jesus.
00:02:34.087 He then alludes to a recentdemand of the Corinthians
00:02:36.657 that he provides someletters of recommendation
00:02:39.247 to prove his authority and credentials.
00:02:41.640 And this is ridiculous to Paul:
00:02:43.700 their church wouldn't evenexist if he hadn't started it,
00:02:46.880 and so he says they are hisproof of genuine leadership,
00:02:50.370 they are his letter of recommendation.
00:02:52.859 He cleverly quotes from theprophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel saying,
00:02:56.619 that God's Spirit has writtenHis letter of recommendation
00:02:59.949 on their hearts as hisnew covenant people.
00:03:02.764 The Corinthians shouldn'tneed any more proof than that.
00:03:05.642 Now the mention of the new covenantit leads Paul into a long comparison
00:03:09.272 between the old covenantbetween God and Israel
00:03:12.022 that was mediated by Moses,
00:03:13.843 and the new covenantbetween God and Corinthians
00:03:16.463 mediated by Jesus in the Spirit.
00:03:18.824 The Old Covenant, made a mount Sinai,
00:03:20.894 it was truly glorious
00:03:23.139 it made Moses himselfshine with God's glory,
00:03:26.119 but that glory eventually faded,
00:03:28.049 not to mention thefact that the laws of
00:03:29.879 that covenant were ineffectiveat truly transforming Israel.
00:03:33.579 But the new covenant, bycomparison, is even more glorious,
00:03:37.089 because the resurrectedJesus is the very glory of God
00:03:40.319 and He lives on forever,
00:03:42.209 and it's His spirit that'snow transforming people
00:03:45.079 to become more faithfuljust, like Jesus himself.
00:03:48.153 Now this all sounds amazing,
00:03:49.533 I mean who doesn't wantto share in God's own glory.
00:03:52.384 But Paul goes on to show
00:03:53.974 how the paradox of the cross
00:03:55.824 turns upside down theCorinthians ideas of glory and succes:
00:03:59.824 after all, Jesus'glorious exaltation as King
00:04:03.124 took place through Hissuffering, execution, and death.
00:04:07.438 On the cross Jesusrevealed God's salvation,
00:04:10.678 He died for the sins of theworld to reconcile people to God.
00:04:14.167 But the Cross does even more:
00:04:15.757 it reveals God's character:
00:04:17.547 He's a being of utterself-giving suffering love
00:04:20.887 that seeks the well-being of others;
00:04:22.833 Across also revealsa new cruciform way of life.
00:04:26.505 And Paul's goal is that his lifeand ministry imitates the cross:
00:04:30.955 so although his apostolic career
00:04:32.785 it's been marked byhumility, suffering by poverty,
00:04:36.185 it was all to serve the Corinthians.
00:04:38.516 And so when they disapproveof Paul's poverty and suffering
00:04:41.466 they disapprove of Jesus too.
00:04:43.466 Paul's way of life andleadership is actually the proof
00:04:46.376 that he authentically representsthe crucified and risen Jesus.
00:04:51.001 Paul really wants toreconcile with the Corinthians
00:04:53.231 but he won't let things lie
00:04:55.011 until they've been transformed
00:04:56.591 and embrace this upside--down paradox of the Cross.
00:05:00.333 After this passionate appeal Paul moves on
00:05:02.843 to address the topicof forgotten generosity.
00:05:05.673 So, the JewishChristians back in Jerusalem
00:05:08.233 they had fallen intopoverty due to a famine,
00:05:11.093 and Paul is raising money amongthe new churches that he started,
00:05:14.423 following mostly non-jews.
00:05:16.092 They would all send a relief gift.
00:05:17.682 as a symbol of theirunity in the Messiah Jesus.
00:05:20.572 And so many of hischurches they werethrilled to give,
00:05:23.202 but the Corinthians, in themidst of all this conflict with Paul,
00:05:26.272 hadn't saved up for the gift.
00:05:28.092 And for Paul, thisisn't just about money.
00:05:30.719 it's another sign that theCorinthians have not been transformed
00:05:34.189 by the gospel about Jesus,
00:05:35.709 which, at its heart, isa story of generosity.
00:05:38.729 Paul says: "You know the generousgrace of our Lord Jesus the Messiah,
00:05:43.139 that even though He was richfor your sake he became poor,
00:05:47.149 so that through Hispoverty you might become rich."
00:05:50.717 He's telling the story of thegospel through financial metaphors:
00:05:54.057 Jesus gave up Hisglorious honor or "wealth"
00:05:57.307 and He lowered himselfto die like a poor slave,
00:06:00.537 so that other people who areimpoverished through sin and death
00:06:04.497 can be exalted and become wealthy
00:06:06.727 through the riches of God's grace.
00:06:08.598 To be a Christian, is to let this storysink deep into your mind and heart
00:06:13.248 letting it transform you into someone
00:06:15.398 who's more generous, more willing
00:06:17.258 to share your life andresources to help others.
00:06:20.259 In the final section of the letterPaul focuses on the main source of
00:06:23.319 his conflict with the Corinthians:
00:06:25.249 that group of impressive leaders
00:06:27.199 that he sarcasticallycalls "super apostles".
00:06:30.339 So they came to Corinthpromoting themselves
00:06:32.999 and bad-mouthing Paul asapoor unsuccessful leader.
00:06:35.999 And at the risk of soundingself-promoting Paul says:
00:06:38.629 "do these guys reallywant to compare credentials?"
00:06:41.493 He can totally take them on.
00:06:43.304 Are they Jewish Bible experts?
00:06:44.944 well so is Paul; he wasa Pharisee for goodness sakes,
00:06:47.794 he has the whole Bible memorized!
00:06:49.860 They want to brag abouttheir superior knowledge Jesus?
00:06:52.870 Paul is actually seen andhung out with the risen Jesus,
00:06:56.320 he's actually had visions ofJesus' heavenly throneroom!
00:06:59.966 But more importantly, Paul has givenhis entire life to the mission of Jesus,
00:07:04.256 he sacrifice comfort and stability
00:07:06.676 and he never askedthe Corinthians for money.
00:07:09.167 Unlike the superapostles who charged alot,
00:07:11.988 Paul earned his own living.
00:07:13.698 But, Paul says, he refuses tobrag about these accomplishments,
00:07:17.588 because these aren't the thingsthat really matter as a Christian.
00:07:20.698 Instead what he'll brag about
00:07:22.538 is how flawed and how weak he is,
00:07:24.968 because it's in those inadequacies
00:07:27.028 that he discoversthe love and mercy of Jesus.
00:07:29.768 Or as Jesus once told Paul:
00:07:31.658 "My grace is sufficient for you,
00:07:33.708 my power is madeperfect through weakness."
00:07:36.800 Paul concludes the letter witha sober warning to the Corinthians,
00:07:40.050 they need to check themselves.
00:07:41.826 Their contempt for Paul his way of life,
00:07:44.036 their love for the super apostles,
00:07:46.166 it all shows that they don't graspwho Jesus is on a fundamental level.
00:07:50.700 They're not living liketransformed followers of Jesus,
00:07:53.250 and so he invites them, once again,
00:07:55.560 to humble themselvesbefore the love of Jesus.
00:07:58.860 Second Corinthians gives us a reallyunique window into the life of Paul
00:08:02.430 and the paradox setbefore us by the cross of Jesus.
00:08:05.690 The cross challenges our values,
00:08:07.540 our ways of seeing the world:
00:08:09.220 We value success, education, wealth.
00:08:12.490 But God values humility and weakness,
00:08:15.540 because His loveand power were made known
00:08:18.110 through the suffering deathand the resurrection of Jesus.
00:08:21.412 The cross also unleashes the trans-orming power and presence of the Spirit,
00:08:25.632 to empower Jesus' followers totake up His "cruciform" way of life
00:08:30.372 and make it their own.
00:08:32.081 And that's what secondCorinthians is all about.
