00:00:02.780 The Book of the Revelation of Jesus
00:00:05.550 The author of this book, which is not called Revelations by the way,
00:00:08.640 is named at the beginning. It was written by John
00:00:11.540 which could refer to the Beloved Disciple who wrote the gospel and the letters of John
00:00:15.690 or it could be a different John - a Messianic Jewish prophet who traveled
00:00:19.880 about and taught in early church.
00:00:21.480 Whichever John it was, he makes clear in the opening paragraph what kind of book he has written.
00:00:26.520 He calls it first of all a revelation or apocalypse.
00:00:30.190 The greek word is Apokalypsis and it refers to a type
00:00:33.180 of literature very familiar to John's readers
00:00:35.860 from the Hebrew scriptures and from other popular Jewish texts.
00:00:39.479 Apokalypsis recounted a prophet's symbolic dreams and visions that
00:00:43.739 revealed God's heavenly perspective on history and current events
00:00:47.480 so that the present could be viewed in light of history's final outcome.
00:00:51.900 And John says this apocalypse is a prophecy which
00:00:54.449 means it's a word from God spoken through a prophet to God's people,
00:00:58.199 usually to warn or comfort them in a time of crisis.
00:01:01.409 By calling this book of prophecy, John saying that it stands in the tradition of the biblical prophets
00:01:06.690 and is bringing their message to a climax.
00:01:08.870 And this apocalyptic prophecy was sent to real people that John knew.
00:01:13.300 The book opens and closes as a circular letter
00:01:15.800 that was sent to seven churches in the ancient Roman province of Asia.
00:01:19.580 Now seven is a meaningful number for John.
00:01:22.240 It's a symbol of completeness based on the seven-day Sabbath cycle in the Old Testament.
00:01:26.900 And John has woven sevens into every single part of this book.
00:01:30.420 Now with this opening John has given us
00:01:32.280 clear guidance about how he wants us to understand this book.
00:01:35.980 Jewish apocalypse is communicated through symbolic imagery and numbers.
00:01:40.180 It is not a secret predictive code about the timing of the end of the world
00:01:44.080 rather John is constantly using these symbols that are drawn from the Old Testament
00:01:49.110 and he expects his readers to go discover what the symbols mean by looking up the text he's alluding to.
00:01:54.630 Also the fact that it's a letter means that John is actually addressing the situation of these first century churches.
00:02:01.180 And so while this book has much to say to Christians of later generations,
00:02:05.020 the books meaning must first be anchored in the historical context of John's time, place, and audience.
00:02:10.759 which brings us into the book's first section
00:02:12.900 Jesus' message to the seven churches
00:02:15.520 John was exiled on the island of Patmos
00:02:18.220 and he saw a vision of the risen Jesus exalted as king of the world.
00:02:21.880 And He was standing among seven burning lights.
00:02:24.640 and John's told this is a symbol of the seven churches in Asia Minor
00:02:28.420 that's been adapted from the book of the Prophet Zechariah.
00:02:31.120 And Jesus starts addressing the specific problems that  face each church
00:02:35.140 Some where apathetic due to wealth and affluence. Others were morally compromised.
00:02:40.020 Their people were still eating ritual meals, and sleeping around, and pagan temples.
00:02:44.300 But others among the churches remained faithful to Jesus.
00:02:47.490 And they were suffering harassment and even violent persecution.
00:02:50.610 And Jesus warns that things are going to get worse.
00:02:53.580 A tribulation is upon the churches that will force them to choose between compromise or faithfulness.
00:02:59.720 By John's day the murder of Christians by the Roman Emperor Nero was passed.
00:03:04.290 And the persecution of Christians by Emperor Domitian was likely underway.
00:03:08.040 And so the temptation was to deny Jesus either to avoid persecution or simply to join the spirit of the Roman age.
00:03:15.100 And Jesus calls them to faithfulness so that they can overcome or literally conquer.
00:03:20.780 And Jesus promises a reward for everyone in these churches who does conquer.
00:03:25.180 Each reward is drawn directly from the books final vision about the marriage of heaven and earth.
00:03:30.260 And so this opening section it sets up the main plot tension that will drive the storyline in this book.
00:03:35.970 Will Jesus' people endure? Will they inherit the new world that God has in store?
00:03:40.090 And why is faithfulness to Jesus described as conquering.
00:03:43.610 The rest of the book is John's answer.
00:03:45.630 After this John has a vision of God's heavenly throne room and
00:03:48.540 he describes it with imagery drawn from many Old Testament prophets.
00:03:52.180 Surrounding God are creatures and elders that represent all creation and human nations
00:03:57.440 and they're giving honor and allegiance to the one true Creator God who is holy holy holy.
00:04:04.000 In God's hand is a scroll that's closed up with seven wax seals.
00:04:08.190 It symbolizes the message of the Old Testament prophets and the sealed scroll of Daniel's visions.
00:04:13.410 these are all about how God's kingdom will come here fully on earth as in heaven
00:04:18.459 But it turns out no one is able to open the scroll
00:04:21.579 until John hears of someone who can.
00:04:23.760 It's the lion from the tribe of Judah and the root of David he can open it.
00:04:28.560 These are classic Old Testament desciptions of the Messianic King
00:04:31.979 who would bring God's kingdom through military conquest.
00:04:34.620 Now that's what John hears but
00:04:36.479 then what he turns and sees is not an aggressive lion king
00:04:40.640 but a sacrifice bloody lamb who's alive standing there
00:04:44.790 and ready to open the scroll.
00:04:46.670 Now the symbol of Jesus as the slain lamb,
00:04:49.830 this is crucially important for understanding the book.
00:04:52.400 John's saying that the Old Testament promise of God's future victorious kingdom
00:04:56.820 was inaugurated through the crucified Messiah.
00:04:59.669 Jesus overcame his enemies by dying for them
00:05:03.000 as the true Passover lamb so that they could be redeemed.
00:05:06.300 Because of the Resurrection Jesus's death on the cross was not a defeat,
00:05:10.330 it was his enthronement it was the way he conquered evil.
00:05:13.889 And so this vision concludes with the lamb
00:05:16.520 alongside the one sitting on the throne and together they are worshipped
00:05:20.340 as the one true creator and Redeemer and the slain lamb begins to open the scroll.
00:05:25.500 It's a symbol of His divine authority to guide history to its conclusion.
00:05:29.820 Which brings us to the next section of the book the three cycles of sevens
00:05:33.240 seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls.
00:05:36.060 And each cycle depicts God's kingdom and justice coming here on earth as in heaven.
00:05:40.400 Now some people think that the three sets of seven divine judgment
00:05:44.100 represent a literal linear sequence of events
00:05:46.780 that either happened in the past
00:05:48.210 or could be happening now
00:05:49.990 or are yet to happen in the future when Jesus returns.
00:05:52.800 But notice how John has woven all the sevens together
00:05:56.080 so the final seven bowls come out of the seventh trumpet and the seventh seal.
00:06:00.740 and the seven trumpets emerge from the seventh seal
00:06:03.620 They're like nesting dolls - each seventh contained to the next seven.
00:06:07.220 Also notice how each of the series of seven culminates in the final judgment
00:06:11.560 and they have matching conclusions.
00:06:13.300 So it's more likely that John is using each set of seven to depict the same period of time
00:06:18.820 between Jesus's resurrection and future returned from three different perspectives.
00:06:23.280 So the slain lamb begins to open the scrolls first four seals
00:06:27.100 and John sees four horsemen. It's an image from the book of Zechariah chapter one.
00:06:31.360 And they symbolize times of war, conquest, famine, and death.
00:06:35.310 In other words a tragically average day in human history.
00:06:38.840 Then the fifth seal depicts the murdered Christian martyrs before God's heavenly throne.
00:06:43.440 And the cry of their innocent blood rises up before God
00:06:46.400 like smoke from the altar of incense.
00:06:48.400 And they're told to rest because more Christians are yet to die.
00:06:52.680 We're not told why but we are told that it won't last forever
00:06:56.160 the sixth seal is God's ultimate response to their cry.
00:06:59.060 He brings the great day of the Lord that was described in Isaiah and Joel.
00:07:03.720 And the people of the earth cry out 'Who is able to stand?!'
00:07:07.530 And then all of a sudden John pauses the action with an intermission to answer that question
00:07:12.340 John sees an angel with a signet ring coming to place a mark of protection on God's servants
00:07:17.500 who are enduring all this hardship
00:07:19.460 and he hears the number of those who are sealed - a hundred and forty-four thousand.
00:07:24.370 It's a military census like the one in the Book of Numbers chapter one.
00:07:28.050 There are twelve thousand from each of the twelve tribes of Israel.
00:07:31.370 Now pay attention. The number of this army is what John heard.
00:07:35.540 Just like he heard about the conquering lion of Judah.
00:07:38.700 But in both cases what he then turned and saw was
00:07:41.760 the surprising fulfillment of those military images in Jesus the slain lamb.
00:07:46.220 So when he sees this messianic army of God's kingdom.
00:07:49.380 It's made up of people from all nations fulfilling God's ancient promise to Abraham.
00:07:54.500 It's this multi-ethnic army of the Lamb who can stand before God
00:07:58.620 because they've been redeemed by the lamb's blood.
00:08:01.360 And now they are called the conquerer
00:08:03.200 not by killing their enemies but by suffering and
00:08:06.060 bearing witness just like the lamb.
00:08:08.300 After this the seventh and final seal is broken
00:08:10.740 but before the scroll is open the seven warning trumpets emerge
00:08:15.020 and fire is taken from the incense altar
00:08:17.160 it symbolizes the cry of the martyrs and
00:08:19.229 it's cast onto the earth bringing the day of the Lord to its completion.
00:08:23.190 Now with the seven trumpets John backs up and he retells the story again.
00:08:27.290 This time with images from the Exodus story.
00:08:29.980 So the first five trumpet blasts replay the plague sent upon Egypt
00:08:33.659 and then the sixth trumpet releases the four horsemen
00:08:36.539 that came from the first four seals.
00:08:38.260 But then John tells us that despite all these plagues
00:08:41.299 the nations did not repent just like pharaoh didn't in the Exodus story.
00:08:45.720 So it seems that God's judgment alone will not bring people to humble repentance before him
00:08:51.580 then John pauses the action again with another intermission.
00:08:54.640 An angel brings the unsealed scroll that was opened by the lamb.
00:08:58.240 And just like Ezekiel John is told to eat the scroll and then proclaim its message to the nations.
00:09:03.840 Finally the lamb scroll is open
00:09:05.610 and now we will discover how God's kingdom will come here on earth.
00:09:09.390 The scrolls content is spelled out in two symbolic visions.
00:09:12.860 First John sees God's temple and the martyrs by the altar and
00:09:16.470 he's told to measure and set them apart.
00:09:19.100 And it's an image of protection taken from Zechariah chapter 2.
00:09:22.380 But then the outer courts in the city are excluded
00:09:24.960 and they get trampled down by the nations.
00:09:27.120 Now some think that this refers literally to
00:09:29.370 a destruction of Jerusalem that happened in the past or will happen in the future.
00:09:33.400 But more likely John's following the tradition of Jesus and the apostles
00:09:37.940 who all use the new temple as a symbol for God's new covenant people.
00:09:42.640 In that case, this is an image about how Jesus' followers may suffer persecution by the nations
00:09:47.560 but this external defeat cannot take away their victory through the lamb.
00:09:51.870 This idea gets expanded in the scrolls' second vision.
00:09:55.160 God appoints two witnesses as prophetic representatives to the nations.
00:09:59.440 And once again some people think this refers literally two prophets who will appear one day in the future.
00:10:04.940 But John calls them lampstands which is one of his clear symbols for the churches.
00:10:09.960 So this vision is more likely about the prophetic role of
00:10:12.760 Jesus' followers who are to take up the mantle of Moses and Elijah
00:10:17.180 and call idolatrous nations and rulers to turn back to the one true God.
00:10:21.580 But then all of a sudden a horrible beast appears,
00:10:24.700 let the reader remember Daniel chapter 7,
00:10:27.040 and the beast conquers the witnesses and kills them.
00:10:30.080 But then God brings them back to life
00:10:32.240 and vindicates the witnesses before their persecutors
00:10:34.960 and the end result is that many among the nations finally do repent
00:10:39.280 and give glory to the Creator God
00:10:41.420 in the day of the Lord.
00:10:42.740 Now, stop. Think about the story so far.
00:10:45.380 God's warning judgments through the seals and through the trumpets
00:10:48.820 did not generate repentance among the nations
00:10:51.209 just like the Exodus plagues only hardened Pharaoh's heart.
00:10:54.509 But the lamb, He conquered his enemies by loving them, dying for them.
00:10:59.080 And now the message of the lamb's scroll reveals the mission of his army, the church.
00:11:03.980 God's kingdom will be revealed when the nations see the church
00:11:07.760 imitating the loving sacrifice of the Lamb
00:11:10.510 not killing their enemies but dying for them.
00:11:12.910 It is God's mercy shown through Jesus' followers that will bring the nations to repentance.
00:11:18.640 And this surprising claim is the message of the open scroll
00:11:22.240 that John has placed at the exact center of the entire book.
00:11:25.860 After this the last trumpet sounds and the nations are
00:11:28.300 shaken as God's kingdom comes here on earth as it is in heaven.
00:11:32.110 So now we know how the church will bear witness to the nations and inherit the new creation
00:11:36.760 but who was that terrible beast that waged war on God's people?
00:11:40.810 And how will the whole story turn out? John will tell us in the second half of the Book of the Revelation.
