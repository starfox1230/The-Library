00:00:02.490 Paul's letter to the Philippians
00:00:05.040 The church in Philippi was the first Jesus community Paul started in Eastern Europe.
00:00:09.440 That story is told in Acts chapter 16.
00:00:11.720 Philippi was a Roman colony in ancient Macedonia.
00:00:15.200 It was full of retired soldiers and it was known for its patriotic nationalism.
00:00:19.700 There Paul faced resistance when he was announcing Jesus as the true king of the world.
00:00:25.700 After Paul moved on from there, those who became followers of Jesus continued to suffer resistance and even persecution
00:00:32.780 but they remained a vibrant community, faithful to the way of Jesus.
00:00:36.640 Paul sent this letter from one of his many imprisonments.
00:00:39.780 For a very practical reason, the Philippians had sent one of their members, Epaphroditus,
00:00:44.580 to take a financial gift to Paul to support him in prison.
00:00:48.440 Paul sent back this letter with Epaphroditus to say, "Thank you," and to do a whole lot more.
00:00:54.300 The design of this letter doesn't develop one single idea from beginning to end, like many of Paul's other letters.
00:01:00.540 Rather, Paul has arranged a series of short reflective essays or vignettes.
00:01:05.519 They all revolve around the center of gravity in this letter, which is a poem in chapter 2.
00:01:11.310 It artistically retells the story of the Messiah's incarnation, his life, death, resurrection and exaltation.
00:01:18.900 Then in each of these vignettes Paul will take up key words or ideas from that poem
00:01:25.040 to show how living as a Christian means seeing your own story as a lived expression of Jesus' story.
00:01:32.540 So Paul opens the letter with a prayer of gratefulness.
00:01:35.100 He thanks God for the Philippian's generosity, for their faithfulness
00:01:39.120 and he expresses his confidence that the life transforming work that God has begun in them
00:01:44.880 will continue into greater and more beautiful expressions of faithfulness and love.
00:01:49.620 Paul then focuses on their obvious concern at the moment, which is his status in prison.
00:01:54.680 Being in a Roman prison was no picnic.
00:01:57.760 But, paradoxically it has turned out for good to advance the good news about Jesus.
00:02:02.460 So all of the Roman guards, the administrators all know
00:02:06.000 that Paul is in prison for announcing Jesus as the risen Lord.
00:02:09.699 His imprisonment has inspired confidence in other Christians to talk about Jesus more openly.
00:02:15.182 Paul is optimistic he will be released from prison but it is possible that he could be executed.
00:02:20.970 As he reflects on it, that actually would not be so bad because,
00:02:24.540 "For me," Paul says, "Life is the Messiah. So dying would be a gain."
00:02:30.000 For Paul, his life in the present and in the future is defined by the life and love of Jesus for him.
00:02:36.940 If he is executed, that means he will be present with Jesus, which would be great for him.
00:02:42.212 And if he is released, well that would mean he could keep working to start more Jesus communities,
00:02:47.140 which would be better for other people, so that is what he hopes for.
00:02:51.400 Notice how his train of thought works here.
00:02:54.380 Dying for Jesus is not the true sacrifice for Paul.
00:02:58.260 Rather, it is staying alive to serve others.
00:03:00.900 That is Paul's way of participating in the story of Jesus,
00:03:05.000 to suffer in order to love others more than himself.
00:03:08.340 Paul then turns to the Philippians and he urges them to participate in Jesus' example by taking up the same mindset.
00:03:15.280 He says your life as citizens should be consistent with the good news about the Messiah.
00:03:20.880 These Christians in Philippi were living in a hotbed of Roman patriotism.
00:03:25.660 But their way of life was to be shaped by another king, Jesus.
00:03:30.300 That might bring persecution.
00:03:32.560 but they are not to be afraid because suffering for being associated with Jesus
00:03:37.300 is a way of living out the story of Jesus himself,
00:03:40.740 which leads Paul into the great poem of chapter 2.
00:03:43.700 It is rich with echoes of Old Testament texts,
00:03:46.440 specifically the story of Adam in his rebellion in Genesis 1 through 3,
00:03:50.660 and the poems about the suffering servant in the book of Isaiah.
00:03:54.120 This poem is worth committing to memory.
00:03:56.500 It is a beautifully condensed version of the Gospel story.
00:03:59.752 Before becoming human, the Messiah pre-existed in a state of glory and equality with God.
00:04:06.840 And, unlike Adam, who tried to seize equality with God,
00:04:10.220 the Messiah chose not to exploit his equal status for his self advantage.
00:04:14.960 Rather, he emptied himself of status.
00:04:17.700 He became a human.
00:04:19.160 He became a servant to all.
00:04:20.440 And, even more than that, he allowed himself to be humiliated.
00:04:24.500 He was obedient to the Father by going to his death on a Roman execution rack.
00:04:29.520 But through God's power and grace, the Messiah's shameful death has been reversed through the resurrection.
00:04:36.420 Now God has highly exalted Jesus as the king of all, bestowing upon him the name that is above all names
00:04:43.640 so that all creation should recognize that Jesus the Messiah is Lord
00:04:49.100 to the glory of God the Father.
00:04:51.140 Now, that last statement is astounding.
00:04:53.220 Paul is quoting from Isaiah chapter 45.
00:04:56.000 It is a passage where all creation comes to recognize the God of Israel as Lord.
00:05:02.120 Paul's point here is very clear.
00:05:03.980 In the crucified and risen Jesus,
00:05:06.140 we discover that the one true God of Israel consists of God the Father and the Lord Jesus.
00:05:12.960 For Paul, this poem expresses his convictions about who Jesus is, and it does more.
00:05:18.800 It offers the example of Jesus as a way of life that his followers are to imitate.
00:05:24.280 That is why Paul immediately goes on to tell two stories
00:05:27.420 first about Timothy, then about Epaphroditus,
00:05:30.086 because they are both examples of people living out Jesus' story.
00:05:34.700 Timothy is like Jesus because he is constantly concerned for
00:05:38.590 the well-being of other people more than his own.
00:05:41.300 Epaphroditus, who the Philippians sent with their gift, ended up risking his life to serve Paul in prison.
00:05:47.640 He got so sick he almost died trying to help Paul.
00:05:50.800 But God had mercy on him and Paul by sparing him the loss of a friend.
00:05:55.260 Paul's point here is that these are the kinds of people who are living breathing examples of the story of Jesus.
00:06:02.000 They are worthy of invitation.
00:06:04.120 Paul then turns to his own story as an example.
00:06:06.920 Those Christians who had been demanding circumcision of non-Jewish Christians,
00:06:11.520 remember his letter to the Galatians,
00:06:13.700 these people are still stirring up trouble for Paul.
00:06:16.760 They keep reminding him of his own past when he used to persecute Jesus' followers,
00:06:22.400 when he tried to show his right standing before God
00:06:25.260 by his zealous obedience to the laws of the Torah.
00:06:28.340 But, like Jesus, Paul has given up all of that status and privilege.
00:06:33.100 He now regards all of it as filth.
00:06:36.020 The word he uses is actually much less polite.
00:06:39.080 He has given it all up to become a servant like Jesus,
00:06:42.840 to participate in his suffering and sacrificial love
00:06:46.300 and he does all of it in the hope that Jesus' love will carry him through death and out the other side into resurrection.
00:06:54.480 So Paul says that for followers of Jesus, their true citizenship is in heaven,
00:07:00.160 which, for Paul, does not mean that we should all hope to get away from Earth and go to heaven one day.
00:07:05.360 Rather, heaven is the transcendent place where Jesus reigns as king.
00:07:10.820 He says we are eagerly awaiting our royal savior to come from there and return here
00:07:16.620 to bring his kingdom of healing justice and transforming love;
00:07:20.348 to bring about a new creation.
00:07:22.163 Paul then challenges the Philippians to keep living out the Jesus story.
00:07:26.105 He first addresses two prominent women leaders in the church who worked alongside Paul.
00:07:30.699 They are in some kind of conflict.
00:07:32.469 So, Paul pleads with them to follow Jesus' example of humility to reconcile and become unified.
00:07:38.760 Paul then urges the Philippians not to give in to fear but, despite their persecution,
00:07:43.700 to vent all of their emotion and their needs to God who will give them peace.
00:07:48.620 That peace, Paul says, comes by focusing your thoughts on what is good and true and lovely.
00:07:54.820 There is always something that you could complain about.
00:07:57.500 But a follower of Jesus knows that all of life is a gift and can choose to see beauty and grace in any life circumstance.
00:08:04.640 Which leads Paul to his conclusion.
00:08:06.722 He again thanks the Philippians for their sacrificial gift
00:08:09.460 He wants them to know that his imprisonments, that his times of poverty, are not true hardships for him.
00:08:16.880 They have actually become his greatest teachers,
00:08:19.660 showing him that no matter his circumstances, he has learned the secret of contentment.
00:08:24.963 It is simple dependence on the one who strengthens him.
00:08:28.527 Paul has come to see his own suffering as a participation in the story of Jesus.
00:08:33.620 The letter to the Philippians gives us a unique window into Paul's own heart and mind.
00:08:38.400 He saw his entire life as a reenactment of the story of Jesus.
00:08:42.969 You can sense in this letter his close connection to Jesus,
00:08:47.140 his awareness that Jesus' love and presence is closer than his own skin.
00:08:51.480 That is what gave him hope and humility in his darkest hours.
00:08:55.800 So Paul shows us that knowing Jesus is always a deeply personal transforming encounter.
00:09:02.920 That is the kind of Jesus that Paul invites others to follow.
00:09:06.780 And that is what Paul's letter to the Philippians is all about.
