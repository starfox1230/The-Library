00:00:02.860 The Gospel according to Matthew
00:00:05.020 It's one of the earliest official accounts about Jesus of Nazareth: his life,
00:00:08.829 his death and his resurrection.
00:00:10.720 The book itself is anonymous
00:00:12.700 but the earliest reliable tradition links it to Matthew,
00:00:15.500 the tax collector, who was one of the twelve apostles
00:00:18.100 that Jesus appointed
00:00:19.260 and he actually appears within
00:00:20.360 the book itself.
00:00:21.860 For about 30 to 40 years, the apostles orally taught
00:00:25.500 and passed on their eyewitness' account about Jesus
00:00:28.140 along with his teachings that they had all memorized.
00:00:31.280 Matthew has then collected and arranged all these into this amazing tapestry
00:00:36.220 and designed the book to highlight certain themes about Jesus.
00:00:40.260 In this video, we're just going to cover the first half of the book.
00:00:43.000 Specifically, Matthew wants to show how Jesus is
00:00:45.380 the continuation and fulfillment
00:00:47.440 of the whole biblical story about God in Israel:
00:00:50.440 1. that Jesus is the Messiah from the line of David;
00:00:53.520 2. that he is a new authoritative teacher like Moses;
00:00:56.820 3. and not only that Jesus is: "God with us"
00:00:59.960 or in Hebrew "Immanuel".
00:01:01.600 Matthew's designed this book with an introduction
00:01:05.060 and a conclusion. These act like a frame
00:01:08.260 around five clear sections right here in the center
00:01:10.840 each of which concludes with a long
00:01:12.800 block of Jesus's teaching.
00:01:15.120 Now this design is very intentional and it's amazing.
00:01:18.660 Just watch how this works!
00:01:19.760 Chapters 1 through 3: they set the stage by
00:01:22.660 attaching Jesus's story right on
00:01:25.080 to the story line of the Old Testament scriptures.
00:01:27.420 So Matthew opens with the genealogy about Jesus
00:01:30.100 that highlights how he is from the messianic line of
00:01:33.480 the son of David and he's a son of Abraham.
00:01:36.260 That means he's going to bring God's blessing to all of the nations.
00:01:39.260 After that we get the famous story about Jesus's birth
00:01:42.340 and how all of the events fulfilled the Old Testament prophetic promises:
00:01:46.600 that the nations would come and honor the Messiah;
00:01:49.780 that the messiah would be born in Bethlehem.
00:01:51.680 But even more than that, Jesus's conception by the Holy Spirit,
00:01:54.700 his name Immanuel, all these work together to show that
00:01:58.340 Jesus is no mere human. He is God with us.
00:02:02.160 God becomes human.
00:02:03.720 So you can see two of Matthew's key themes right here in the introduction:
00:02:08.780 1. He's from the line of David
00:02:10.380 2. He's Immanuel.
00:02:11.280 But Matthew also wants to show how Jesus is a new Moses.
00:02:15.640 So like Moses, Jesus came up out of Egypt.
00:02:18.640 He passed through the waters of Baptism
00:02:21.960 and he entered into the wilderness for 40 days.
00:02:25.220 Then Jesus goes up onto a mountain
00:02:27.520 to deliver his new teaching.
00:02:29.140 So through all of this, Matthew was claiming that
00:02:31.760 Jesus is the promised greater than Moses figure
00:02:34.480 who's going to deliver Israel from slavery,
00:02:37.680 he's going to give them new divine teaching.
00:02:39.560 he's going to save them from their sins.
00:02:41.820 and bring about a new covenant relationship between God and his people.
00:02:45.440 This Moses and Jesus parallel also explains
00:02:49.220 why Matthew has structured the center of the book the way that he did.
00:02:53.040 These five main parts highlight
00:02:56.060 Jesus as a teacher and he's created a parallel.
00:02:59.800 Jesus as a teacher, parallels the five books of Moses.
00:03:03.140 Jesus is the new authoritative covenant teacher
00:03:06.860 who's going to fulfill the story line of the Torah.
00:03:09.540 Now in the first section, chapters 4 to 7,
00:03:12.380 Jesus steps onto the scene announcing the arrival of God's Kingdom.
00:03:15.360 And this is really key:
00:03:16.800 the kingdom is in essence about God's rescue operation
00:03:20.640 for his whole world and it's taking place through King Jesus.
00:03:24.500 Jesus has come to confront evil, especially,
00:03:27.460 spiritual evil and its whole legacy of demon oppression and disease and death.
00:03:32.240 Jesus has come to restore
00:03:33.900 God's Rule and reign over the whole world
00:03:36.960 by creating a new
00:03:38.760 family of people who will
00:03:40.760 follow him obey his teachings
00:03:42.240 and live under his rule.
00:03:43.880 So after Jesus begins healing people and forming
00:03:47.420 a movement, a community, he takes his followers out to a
00:03:50.720 mountain or a hillside and he delivers his first big block
00:03:54.280 of teaching traditionally called the Sermon on the Mount.
00:03:57.020 Here Jesus explores what it looks like to follow him
00:04:00.360 and live in God's kingdom.
00:04:02.340 It's an upside-down kingdom where there are no privileged members.
00:04:06.260 So the poor, the nobodies, the wealthy, the religious,
00:04:09.220 everybody is invited and is called to turn to repent
00:04:13.400 and to follow Jesus and join his family.
00:04:15.760 Jesus says that he's not here to set aside
00:04:18.079 the commands of the Torah or the Old Testament,
00:04:20.700 rather he's here to fulfill all of that
00:04:24.180 through his life, through his teachings.
00:04:26.420 He's here to transform the hearts of his people
00:04:29.340 so that they can truly love God and love their neighbor,
00:04:32.740 including their enemy.
00:04:33.860 After concluding his great teaching on the kingdom,
00:04:36.440 the next section shows Jesus bringing
00:04:38.240 the kingdom into reality in the day-to-day lives of people.
00:04:41.520 So Matthew's arranged here nine stories about Jesus
00:04:45.140 bringing the power of God's Kingdom
00:04:47.640 into the lives of hurting broken people.
00:04:50.880 There are three groups of three stories.
00:04:53.420 They're all about people who are sick or
00:04:55.400 have broken bodies or they're in danger.
00:04:58.280 Jesus heals or saves them by these acts of grace and power.
00:05:01.420 Then right, in between these triads,
00:05:04.620 we find two parallel stories about Jesus's call
00:05:08.360 that people should follow him.
00:05:10.540 Matthew's making a point here: one can only experience
00:05:14.280 the power of Jesus's Grace by following him and
00:05:17.920 becoming his disciple.
00:05:19.640 Now, after Matthew has shown
00:05:21.640 the power of the kingdom through Jesus,
00:05:23.060 Jesus then extends his reach by sending out
00:05:26.220 the twelve disciples who are going to go do what he's been doing.
00:05:28.840 This leads to the second large block of teaching chapter 10.
00:05:32.760 Here, Jesus teaches his disciples how to announce the
00:05:35.940 kingdom and what to expect once they do.
00:05:38.440 Many among Israel are accepting Jesus in his offer
00:05:42.260 of the kingdom, but Israel's leaders
00:05:44.100 they aren't. They stand to lose a lot
00:05:46.840 if they repent and become disciples of Jesus.
00:05:49.180 So Jesus knows they're going to reject him and
00:05:51.760 persecute his followers, which is exactly
00:05:53.820 what happens. In the next section chapters 11 through 13,
00:05:57.120 Matthew has collected a group of stories about how people are responding to Jesus and his message.
00:06:02.920 It's a mixed bag.
00:06:04.000 So some stories are positive.
00:06:05.380 People love Jesus and they think he's the Messiah.
00:06:07.780 Others are more neutral like John the Baptist
00:06:10.800 or even the members of Jesus's own family.
00:06:13.240 They make it clear that Jesus is not what they expected
00:06:16.660 Then you have Israel's leaders.
00:06:18.740 They're entirely negative.
00:06:19.960 You have the Pharisees and the Bible scholars.
00:06:22.340 They all reject Jesus together.
00:06:24.980 They think he is a false teacher,
00:06:26.440 he's leading the people astray.
00:06:28.040 They think he's blasphemous,
00:06:29.320 in these exalted claims he's making about himself.
00:06:32.160 But Jesus isn't surprised or thrown by all these diverse
00:06:35.980 responses. In fact, he focuses on it in the third block of teaching in chapter 13.
00:06:41.540 Here Matthews collected together a bunch of Jesus's
00:06:44.060 parables about the kingdom: like about a farmer
00:06:47.040 throwing seed on four types of soil;
00:06:49.580 or about a mustard seed;
00:06:51.260 or a pearl or buried treasure.
00:06:54.440 These parables are like a commentary on the stories
00:06:57.320 that you've just read in chapters 11 and 12.
00:06:59.720 Some people are accepting Jesus with enthusiasm,
00:07:02.680 others are rejecting him.
00:07:04.500 But God's kingdom is of ultimate value, and it will not
00:07:08.060 stop spreading despite all of these obstacles.
00:07:10.720 So, that's the first half of the gospel according to Matthew.
00:07:14.400 Now, here's a few more things to look for as you read through these chapters.
00:07:17.860 Matthew's presenting Jesus, remember,
00:07:20.520 as the continuation and fulfillment of the Old Testament story lines.
00:07:23.420 So, look for how he weaves in quotations from the Old Testament scriptures and what you'll find is that
00:07:29.460 they're placed at strategic points in the story explaining more about
00:07:33.080 Jesus and his identity. So, stop take time to go look up these
00:07:36.840 references and read them in their Old Testament context
00:07:38.880 and most often you'll discover really cool interesting connections.
00:07:42.640 Lastly, pay attention to the types of people who accept
00:07:46.900 Jesus and follow him.
00:07:49.320 You'll see that it's most often people who are
00:07:51.500 unimportant, they're or they're irreligious.
00:07:54.240 These are the people who are
00:07:57.140 transformed by their trust or faith in Jesus and follow him.
00:08:00.780 It's the religious and the prideful who are offended by him
00:08:04.360 So how is this tension between Jesus and Israel's
00:08:07.120 leaders going to play itself out? That's what the second half of Matthew is all about.
