00:00:03.640 The Gospel according to Luke
00:00:04.860 It's the one of the earliest account of Jesus' life
00:00:07.520 and it's actually part 1 of a unified two-volume workLuke - Acts
00:00:12.460 If you compare the opening lines of both of the books
00:00:14.720 It's clear that it comes from the same author
00:00:17.540 And there are internal clues in the book of Acts
00:00:19.560 as well in early tradition that identify the author asLuke
00:00:23.740 the traveling companion and co-worker of Paul the Apostle
00:00:26.640 who we know is also a doctor
00:00:28.800 Luke opens his words with a preface telling how and why he wrote this book
00:00:33.260 He acknowledges that there are many other fine accounts of Jesus' life out there
00:00:37.240 But he wanted to go back to the eyewitness traditions of His many earliest Disciples as he could
00:00:42.180 In order to produce what he called "an orderly account about the things that has been fulfilled among us"
00:00:48.340 Now that word "fulfill" shows us why Luke wrote this account
00:00:52.060 For him, the story of Jesus isn't just ancient history
00:00:55.680 He wants to show how it's the fulfillment of the long covenant story of God and Israel
00:01:01.280 and bigger than that, of the story of God and the whole world
00:01:04.780 The book's design is fairly clear
00:01:06.840 There's a long introduction that sets up the story of John the Baptist and Jesus
00:01:10.900 Then in Chapter 3-9, Luke presents a robust portrait of Jesus and his mission in his home region of Galilee
00:01:17.160 After that, a large mid section of the book is Jesus' long journey to Jerusalem
00:01:21.780 which leads to the story's climax
00:01:23.820 Jesus' final week in Jerusalem leading up to his death and resurrection
00:01:28.100 which then leads on to the book of Acts
00:01:29.940 And in this video, we just gonna focus on the first half of Luke Gospel
00:01:34.300 The extended introduction tells in parallel the birth story of John the Baptist and Jesus
00:01:39.260 So you have this elderly priestly coupleZechariah and Elizabeth
00:01:43.060 and then this young unmarried woman Mary and Joseph
00:01:46.500 They both received an unlikely divine promise that they were going to have a son
00:01:50.920 Both promises are fulfilled then
00:01:53.320 as John and Jesus are born and both parents sing poems of celebration
00:01:57.880 Now these poetic songs, they are filled with echoes from the Old Testament's psalms and prophets
00:02:03.100 showing how these children would fulfill God's ancient promises
00:02:07.080 But these poems also preview each child's role in the story to follow
00:02:11.480 So John is the prophetic messenger promised in the Torah and the Prophets who is going prepare Israel to meet their God
00:02:17.860 and Jesus, He's the Messianic King promised to David who's going to bring God's reign over Israel
00:02:23.420 and God's blessings to the nations just like He promised to Abraham
00:02:27.120 After this, Mary brings Jesus to the Jerusalem temple for His dedication
00:02:31.580 and two elderly prophets Anna and Simeon, they see Jesus and they recognize who He is
00:02:37.460 And Simeon sings his own song, a poem inspired by the prophet Isaiah
00:02:41.940 He says this child is God's salvation for Israel and He will become a light to the nations
00:02:48.240 So with all this anticipation, the story moves forward into the next main section
00:02:52.380 where Luke presents Jesus and his mission
00:02:54.820 He sets the stage with John's renewal movement to the Jordan river
00:02:58.500 where he is calling the new repentant recommited Israel into existence through Batism
00:03:03.460 He's preparing for the arrival of God's Kingdom
00:03:06.100 And then, Jesus appears as the leader of this new Israel
00:03:09.720 and He's marked down by the Spirit and the voice of God from Heaven
00:03:14.020 He is the beloved Son of God
00:03:17.100 After this Luke follows with the geneaology
00:03:19.660 and it traces Jesus' origin back to David, and back to Abraham and then all the way back to Adam from the book of Genesis
00:03:26.600 Luke's claiming here: That Jesus is the Messianic King of Israel who brings God's blessings
00:03:32.200 but not only to Israel the family of Abraham
00:03:35.320 He is here for all the sons of Adam, for all humanity.
00:03:39.840 After this Luke has strategically placed the story of Jesus going to his hometown Nazareth
00:03:44.640 where He launches His public mission
00:03:46.520 At the synagogue gathering, Jesus stands up, and He reads from the scroll of Isaiah saying
00:03:51.140 "The Spirit of the LORD is upon me, to preach good news to the poor and freedom for prisoners
00:03:56.840 New sight for the blind, and freedom for the oppressed."
00:04:00.580 Now along with the other gospels, Jesus is presented here He's the Messianic King
00:04:05.080 bringing the good news of God's Kingdom
00:04:07.240 But Luke uniquely highlights are the social implications of Jesus's mission.
00:04:12.520 So He brings freedom, the Greek word is 'aphesis' literally means 'Release'
00:04:18.120 and refers to the ancient Jewish practice of the year of Jubilee described in Leviticus 25
00:04:24.380 It's when all Israel slaves were released, when people's debts were cancelled,
00:04:29.140 when lands that were sold returned back to families.
00:04:32.360 It's all the symbolic reenactment of God's liberating justice and mercy.
00:04:36.920 And then Jesus said that the good news of release is specifically for the poor
00:04:42.020 Now in the Old Testaments, the poor, or in Hebrew 'ani'
00:04:45.620 It's a much broader category than just people who don't have very much money.
00:04:50.020 It refers also to the people of low social status in their culture
00:04:53.940 like people with disabilities, women and children and the elderly
00:04:57.700 It also can include the social outsiders like people of other ethinics groups
00:05:02.340 or people whose poor life choices have placed them outside acceptable religious circles.
00:05:07.480 And Jesus says that God's Kingdom is a specially good news for these people
00:05:11.780 So after this Luke immediately puts in front of us a large block of story
00:05:15.640 showing us what Jesus' good news to the poor looks like
00:05:19.300 It involves the healing of a bed-ridden sick woman, or a man who has a skin disease
00:05:24.500 or someone who is paralyzed
00:05:26.340 The story here also about Jesus welcoming into his community a tax collector
00:05:30.980 like, Levite who is not financially poor but he is a social outsider
00:05:36.120 There's a story about Jesus forgiving a prostitute
00:05:38.740 Luke's showing us how Jesus' Kingdom brought restoration and reversal of people's whole life circumstances.
00:05:45.480 He's expanding the circle of people who get invited in to discover the healing power of God's Kingdom.
00:05:51.980 And as Jesus' mission attracts a large following He does something even more provocative
00:05:56.920 He forms these people into a New Israel by appointing over them the twelve disciples
00:06:02.120 as leaders corresponding to the twelve tribes of Israel.
00:06:05.420 and then Jesus teaches His manifesto of an upside-down Kingdom.
00:06:09.360 or Luke calls it a Sermon given on the plain.
00:06:12.340 He says God's Love for the outsiders and the poor
00:06:15.540 means that His Kingdom brings a reversal of all of our value systems
00:06:19.800 He is here to form a new alternative people of God who are going to respond to Jesus' invitation
00:06:26.620 by practicing radical generosity by serving the poor, people who are going to lead by serving
00:06:32.800 and live by peacemaking and forgiveness, people who are deeply pious but who reject religious hypocrisy.
00:06:40.080 Now Jesus' radical Kingdom vision has claimed to divine authority.
00:06:43.940 It starts to generate resistance and controversy especially from Israel's religious leaders.
00:06:48.880 His outreach to questionable people, it's a threat to their religious traditions
00:06:53.380 and their sense of social stability and so
00:06:55.800 they start accusing Jesus of blaspheming God, of being a drunken mixing with sinners.
00:07:01.040 And so this session culminates in a new revelation of Jesus' mission to his disciples.
00:07:06.140 He says that, Yes He is the Messianic King
00:07:09.020 and that He is going to assert His reign over Israel by dying in Jerusalem
00:07:14.720 by becoming the suffering servant king of Isaiah 53 who dies for the sins of Israel
00:07:20.580 and then the shocking idea it gets explored in the next story as Jesus goes up a mountain with three of His disciples
00:07:27.080 and He suddenly transforms in front of them
00:07:29.700 They're enveloped in a cloud of God's presence who announces "This is my chosen Son."
00:07:35.940 And then Moses, and Elijah are there.
00:07:38.240 The two other prophets who encountered God's presence and voice on a mountain.
00:07:42.400 And Luke tells us that they were talking together about Jesus' Exodus,
00:07:46.920 that He was about to fulfill in Jerusalem.
00:07:49.440 Now that Greek work 'Exodus' is a clear reference to the Exodus story
00:07:53.780 Luke is portraying Jesus here as a new Moses who will lead His newly formed Israel into freedom
00:07:59.940 and release from the tyranny of sins and evil and all of its forms: personal, spiritual and social.
00:08:06.500 And that going to lead us into the second half of the book, but for now
00:08:10.240 that's the first half of the Gospel according to Luke.
