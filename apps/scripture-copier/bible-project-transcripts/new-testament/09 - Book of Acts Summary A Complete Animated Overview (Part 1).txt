00:00:02.800 The book of Acts.
00:00:04.038 It's the second volumeof a unified two-part work
00:00:07.000 that today we call: Luke - Acts.
00:00:09.100 These were written by the
00:00:10.960 same author, Luke, who was the traveling
00:00:13.210 co-worker with Paul.
00:00:14.900 This is clear from the book's introduction,
00:00:16.100 where Luke says, "I produced my first volume,
00:00:19.500 that's the gospel, about all the things
00:00:21.800 that Jesus began to do and teach."
00:00:24.500 Now Luke's giving a clue here as to what
00:00:27.200 this book of Acts will be about.
00:00:28.400 Volume 1 was about what Jesus began to do and teach,
00:00:32.140 volume 2 will then be about what Jesus
00:00:34.270 continued to do and teach, which leads to
00:00:37.329 a really interesting point about the
00:00:38.890 book's traditional, but not original, name:
00:00:41.289 the Acts of the Apostles.
00:00:43.300 While different apostles do appear in
00:00:45.000 most of these stories, the only single character
00:00:48.000 who unifies the whole story from beginning to end
00:00:50.400 is Jesus himself, acting directly or through the Spirit.
00:00:54.700 And so, the book would more accurately be named
00:00:57.600 the Acts of Jesus and the Spirit.
00:01:00.300 The book's introduction recounts how
00:01:02.100 the risen Jesus spend some 40 days with the disciples,
00:01:05.099 teaching them about the kingdom of God.
00:01:07.200 This connects back to the story of Luke's gospel,
00:01:10.100 where Jesus claimed that He was restoring
00:01:12.900 God's kingdom over the world, beginning with Israel.
00:01:15.700 So He called Israel to live under God's reign by following Him,
00:01:20.200 and He was enthroned as king when He gave up His life,
00:01:23.320 and then conquered death with His love.
00:01:26.100 And so, the book of Acts begins with
00:01:28.060 the risen King Jesus instructing His
00:01:30.370 disciples about life in His kingdom.
00:01:32.830 So He promises that the Spirit will soon come and immerse them in His personal presence,
00:01:37.000 and this fulfills one of the key hopes from the Old Testament prophets:
00:01:40.300 that in the Messianic Kingdom, God's presence, His Spirit, would come
00:01:45.300 and take up residence among His people ina new temple, and transform their hearts.
00:01:50.140 And so, Jesus says, when this happens,
00:01:53.050 the Spirit will empower His disciples to be
00:01:55.900 "My witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, and
00:01:58.810 Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."
00:02:00.640 From here, Jesus is taken up from their sight in a cloud, it's an image drawn from
00:02:05.400 the book of Daniel chapter 7, it shows how Jesus is now being enthroned
00:02:10.060 as the son of man, who was vindicated after His suffering
00:02:13.200 and now shares in God's rule over the world.
00:02:16.100 And so, He promises that He will return one day.
00:02:20.200 And so, the main themes and the design of the book of Acts flow right out of this opening chapter.
00:02:24.900 This is a story about Jesus leading His people by the Spirit to go out into the world,
00:02:30.700 and invite all nations to live under His reign,
00:02:34.000 and so, the story will begin with that message
00:02:36.220 spreading in Jerusalem, and then into the
00:02:38.890 neighboring regions of Judea and Samaria,
00:02:40.690 full of non-Jewish people, and then from there,
00:02:43.150 out to all of the nations into the ends of the earth.
00:02:47.050 This video is just going to focus on the first half of the book,
00:02:49.800 so Jerusalem focus section begins with Jesus' followers waiting until the feast of Pentecost,
00:02:55.900 when all of these Jewish pilgrims from all over the ancient world were in the city,
00:03:00.400 and the Holy Spirit comes on the disciples as a great wind,
00:03:03.500 and something like flames appear over each person's head,
00:03:07.800 and together they start announcing and telling stories of God's mighty deeds,
00:03:12.400 and they're speaking in all of these languages that they didn't know before,
00:03:15.800 but all the people gathered there understand perfectly.
00:03:19.150 Now, in order to see what Luke's emphasizing in this story,
00:03:22.500 it is crucial to see the Old Testament roots of all of these images.
00:03:25.700 So first, the wind and the fire is a direct allusion
00:03:29.400 to the stories about God's glorious fiery presence,
00:03:32.739 filling the tabernacle and the temple.
00:03:34.780 And it's also connected to the prophetic promises
00:03:37.200 that God would come and live by His Spirit
00:03:39.220 in the new temple of the Messianic Kingdom.
00:03:42.400 And so here in Acts, God's fiery presence comes to dwell,
00:03:46.600 not in a building, but in His people.
00:03:49.239 Luke is saying that the new temple promised by the prophets,
00:03:53.300 is Jesus' new covenant family, the people of Jesus,
00:03:57.010 which connects to the second thing Luke is trying to say here.
00:04:00.600 So, the prophets promised that when God came to dwell
00:04:03.489 in His new temple, He would reunify all the
00:04:05.920 tribes of Israel under the Messianic King
00:04:07.900 and that the good news of God's reign
00:04:10.180 would go out and be announced to the nations.
00:04:12.700 Luke describes in detail the international, multi-tribe makeup of
00:04:18.310 all of the Israelites who were there at Pentecost and who responded to Peter's message.
00:04:22.700 And so the Apostles keep calling Israelites to acknowledge Jesus as their Messiah,
00:04:27.700 and thousands upon thousands respond,
00:04:30.000 forming new communities of generosity and
00:04:33.480 worship and celebration, but not everybody's celebrating.
00:04:37.900 From here, Luke shows how Jesus' new family quickly
00:04:41.700 faced hostility from the Jerusalem leaders.
00:04:43.900 With a really beautiful symmetrical design,
00:04:46.400 Luke tells a tale of two temples.
00:04:48.090 So God's new temple, the community of Jesus' followers,
00:04:52.500 they're gathering every day in the temple courts,
00:04:54.450 and from house to house.
00:04:56.600 Now, in between those notices are two stories about Peter
00:04:59.580 and the other apostles healing people in the temple courts,
00:05:03.200 only to get arrested by the temple leaders,
00:05:05.800 followed each time by speech of Peter, claiming that Jesus is the true king of Israel,
00:05:10.100 and at the center of all this, is a story about Jesus's followers donating property and possessions
00:05:16.200 to a common fund to help the poor,
00:05:18.800 which is really cool, but it seems kind of random for Luke to mention it here,
00:05:22.500 until you realize that this was a practice described in the laws of the Torah
00:05:27.400 and was supposed to be happening through the Jerusalem Temple and its leaders.
00:05:32.730 So, Luke's point here is clear.
00:05:34.200 The new temple of Jesus' community is fulfilling the purpose that God always intended for the
00:05:39.660 Jerusalem Temple, to be a place where heaven and earth meet,
00:05:42.600 where people encounter God's generosity and healing presence.
00:05:47.000 And this conflict between the two temples that culminates in Acts chapter six and seven
00:05:52.000 is the first wave of persecution. So Jesus' followers,
00:05:55.380 they continue to multiply, requiring more leaders,
00:05:57.750 and one of these, Stephen, is a bold witness for Jesus in Jerusalem,
00:06:03.000 and he ends up getting arrested,
00:06:04.600 and he's accused of speaking against and even threatening the temple,
00:06:08.000 and so Stephen here gives a long speech showing
00:06:11.000 how Israel's leaders have always rejected the messengers God sent them,
00:06:15.400 including Jesus, and now His disciples.
00:06:18.100 So the Jerusalem leaders are enraged, they murder Stephen, and they launched a wave of persecution
00:06:22.920 against Jesus' followers that drives most of them from the city.
00:06:27.120 But it has a paradoxical effect.
00:06:29.700 Luke shows how this tragedy actually became the means
00:06:32.430 by which Jesus' people are nowsent out into Judea and Samaria.
00:06:37.500 Now in this section, Luke hascollected a diverse group of stories
00:06:41.680 that all show how the mostly Jewish,Jerusalem-based, community of Jesus
00:06:46.449 became a multi-ethnic international movement.
00:06:49.200 So first is the mission of Philip into Samaria.
00:06:52.400 It's the land of Israel's hated enemies, and many of them come to follow Jesus.
00:06:57.100 Next, we have the conversion of Saul of Tarsus, later known as Paul.
00:07:01.200 He was the sworn enemy and persecutor of Jesus' followers, until he personally met the risen Jesus,
00:07:07.200 and he then became a passionate advocate on behalf of Jesus.
00:07:11.600 Next is the story of Peter having a vision about how God doesn't consider
00:07:15.400 non-Jewish people ritually impure or unworthy of joining Jesus' family.
00:07:21.200 And so Peter, he's led by the Spirit into the house of a Roman soldier, full of non-Jewish people,
00:07:26.800 and they all respond to the good news about Jesus.
00:07:29.400 In fact, the Spirit shows up powerfully upon them just as He did to the Jewish disciples back in chapter 2.
00:07:36.190 These themes all come together in the founding of the church in Antioch,
00:07:40.570 the largest, most cosmopolitan city in that part of the Roman Empire.
00:07:44.200 And Luke, he tells us that Barnabas,a Jewish leader from the Jerusalem church,
00:07:48.600 went along with Paul to help leadthis church community.
00:07:51.200 And so, it became the first largemulti-ethnic church in history.
00:07:57.000 It was where Jesus' followerswere called Christians for the first time.
00:08:00.800 And it's from here that the first international missionaries were sent out.
00:08:04.600 And so we see Jesus' Commission coming true, and this takes us into the rest of Luke's story
00:08:10.840 but for now, that's the first half of the book of Acts.
