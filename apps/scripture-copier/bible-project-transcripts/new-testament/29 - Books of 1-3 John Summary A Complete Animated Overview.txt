00:00:00.000 The letters of first, second and third John first
00:00:02.700 John is actually anonymous but second
00:00:05.040 and third John are written by someone who is
00:00:06.660 called "The Elder". Now the language and
00:00:08.940 style of all three of these works are
00:00:10.740 identical to each other and to John's
00:00:13.110 gospel and so most people think that all
00:00:15.599 of them come from the disciple that
00:00:17.250 Jesus loved now that could be John the
00:00:20.010 sons of Zebedee, one of the twelve
00:00:21.779 apostles, or it could be another John
00:00:24.420 among Jesus's earliest disciples known
00:00:26.789 as John "The Elder". Whichever John it was he's
00:00:29.910 now in his old age and he's overseeing a
00:00:31.740 network of house church communities that
00:00:33.870 are likely around the city of ancient
00:00:35.850 Ephesus. Now, from clues within the gospel
00:00:38.430 and from these letters
00:00:39.870 it seems that these communities were
00:00:41.190 made up mostly of Jewish followers of
00:00:43.440 Jesus and that they had recently gone
00:00:45.450 through a crisis that motivated John to
00:00:47.820 write these letters. He mentions that a
00:00:50.129 group of people have broken off from
00:00:51.750 these churches these people no longer
00:00:53.610 acknowledge Jesus as Israel's Messiah or
00:00:56.430 as the Son of God and they're stirring
00:00:58.710 up hostility among those who stayed
00:01:00.809 faithful to the churches. In fact, second
00:01:02.910 and third John clearly addressed this
00:01:04.709 conflict. Second John is a warning to a
00:01:07.470 specific house church. There are people
00:01:09.510 who deny Jesus John calls them deceivers
00:01:12.360 and they're probably going to come
00:01:13.770 looking for validation or support and
00:01:16.290 this church community is not to offer
00:01:18.360 any. Third John is actually written to a
00:01:20.820 member of one of these house churches,
00:01:22.710 a man named Gaius, and the elder asked him
00:01:25.140 to welcome legitimate missionaries who
00:01:27.360 are going to arrive soon. He has to tell
00:01:29.759 him to do this because the leader of
00:01:31.740 that church community , Deotrephes, is
00:01:33.990 acting like a jerk and he's rejecting
00:01:36.180 anybody associated with John the Elder.
00:01:38.700 and so these letters give us a window
00:01:40.890 into the tension and conflict that John
00:01:42.899 faced in these churches and first John was
00:01:45.630 written as a response to all of this, as
00:01:48.299 a form of damage control. The Elder
00:01:50.460 assures those who still believe in the
00:01:52.890 Messiah, Jesus, that God is with them as
00:01:55.860 they adhere to the truth. And so all of
00:01:58.259 this helps us understand the uniqueness
00:01:59.820 of first John which is actually not a
00:02:02.100 letter at all.
00:02:03.299 It reads more like a poetic sermon sent
00:02:05.790 to these churches. John says that he's
00:02:07.799 not communicating new information. In
00:02:09.989 fact almost all of the key ideas and
00:02:12.300 words in first John come right out of
00:02:14.610 Jesus's teachings in the Gospel of John
00:02:16.770 and so John's goal is to remind them and
00:02:19.800 persuade these Christians to stay true
00:02:22.350 to what they already say they believe,
00:02:24.780 The poetic quality of John's sermon is
00:02:26.850 really cool
00:02:27.750 he doesn't develop his ideas in a linear
00:02:30.090 or logical way rather he uses a
00:02:32.790 well-known technique of ancient rhetoric
00:02:34.830 called amplification. S o John has just a
00:02:37.980 few core ideas he wants to communicate
00:02:40.260 about life and truth and love
00:02:43.260 and he's going to cycle around these ideas
00:02:45.480 repeatedly each time offering a little
00:02:47.910 bit different of an angle or emphasis. He
00:02:50.220 uses a lot of hyperbole, uses very stark
00:02:52.860 contrast with simple images of light and
00:02:56.010 dark and love and hate and good and evil
00:02:58.890 but don't let the simplicity of first John
00:03:01.170 fool you. This work is deeply profound.
00:03:03.600 There's a clear introduction to first  John
00:03:06.120 and then a clear conclusion and the
00:03:08.310 flowing cycles of the sermon in between
00:03:10.800 these two don't follow any kind of rigid
00:03:12.960 literary design, but there do seem to be
00:03:15.210 two larger sections each one is marked
00:03:17.970 off by the introductory phrase: "This is
00:03:20.310 the message", and then each is followed by
00:03:22.380 a repetition of images about how God is
00:03:25.140 first light and then how God is love and
00:03:28.890 all of the ideas in these two parts flow
00:03:31.230 out of and cycle back into these two
00:03:33.810 core ideas. So, the introduction is very
00:03:36.090 similar to the prologue of the gospel of
00:03:38.250 John. It has echoes of Genesis chapter one
00:03:40.680 and proverbs chapter eight. John speaks of
00:03:43.320 the "word of life" that was with God in
00:03:45.480 the beginning. For John the word God
00:03:48.030 refers to both the Father and the Son
00:03:50.640 who came to bring life into the world.
00:03:52.500 And so those who saw and heard and
00:03:55.080 touched the Son are called "we". John's
00:03:58.080 referring to himself and the apostles
00:04:00.060 who were eyewitnesses of Jesus and so
00:04:02.310 now, "we" have a message for "you" the next
00:04:05.160 generation of Jesus's followers. So when
00:04:07.560 the Apostles share the word of life with
00:04:10.320 others, these others are also brought
00:04:12.570 into fellowship with the Father and the
00:04:14.700 Son through the Apostles The word
00:04:16.798 fellowship here is "Koinonia" in Greek, it
00:04:19.019 means "a participation" or "sharing" when
00:04:21.720 people hear the message about Jesus
00:04:24.060 through the Apostles that
00:04:25.800 message brings them into a real
00:04:27.780 relationship with Jesus himself and into a
00:04:30.449 real participation in God's own love and
00:04:33.840 life. And so this flows right into the
00:04:35.699 first main section. This is the message:
00:04:37.860 God. Is. light. This is the message of the
00:04:42.030 Apostles that the God revealed in Jesus
00:04:44.069 is light. And so, if people want to
00:04:47.280 participate in God's own life through
00:04:49.979 Jesus they need to keep walking in the
00:04:52.620 light which is a really cool image but
00:04:54.840 what does it mean? It means for John to
00:04:57.330 keep Jesus's commands. A nd that's hard so
00:05:00.449 when you fail Jesus's atoning death will
00:05:03.090 cover for your sins and then once again
00:05:05.580 you're called to get up and obey Jesus's
00:05:07.319 teachings. But which one of he's
00:05:09.330 teachings? John reminds the churches of
00:05:11.250 Jesus's "old / new command" given to the
00:05:14.490 disciples at the Last Supper, that they
00:05:16.590 love one another as he loved them. Doing
00:05:20.190 this is walking in the light. Now, if
00:05:23.069 God's light is now shining through Jesus
00:05:26.009 then that means the world's darkness is
00:05:28.259 passing away, which also means that God's
00:05:30.449 children already, in this moment, have
00:05:32.580 victory over the sin and evil and death
00:05:35.430 that reigns in the world. And so that
00:05:37.590 leads John to challenge the churches:
00:05:39.419 "Don't love the world". Because it's
00:05:41.969 passing away too.
00:05:43.259 He's referring here specifically to
00:05:44.610 pride and sexual corruption likely these
00:05:47.699 are problems connected to the conflict
00:05:49.380 that was happening in the churches. And
00:05:51.210 so this leads John to warn the churches
00:05:53.250 about these people who have left the
00:05:55.199 communities and who deny Jesus as the
00:05:57.479 Messiah. John calls them the anti
00:05:59.699 messiahs and deceivers but he's
00:06:02.190 confident that those who still know the
00:06:04.080 truth about Jesus are in fact the true
00:06:06.870 children of God and they are loved by
00:06:09.900 the Father and they show that they're
00:06:11.490 part of God's family when they do
00:06:13.259 righteousness and when they love one
00:06:15.300 another
00:06:16.080 unlike the deceivers, who are generating
00:06:18.330 anger and strife and division. And so the
00:06:20.520 transitions into the second main section
00:06:22.710 of the sermon. This is the message of the
00:06:24.990 Apostles ,John says, that: God. Is. Love. and
00:06:28.620 so God's children should love one
00:06:30.479 another and avoid hatred.
00:06:32.849 Don't be like Cain from Genesis chapter
00:06:35.159 four, John says, his hatred led him to
00:06:37.740 murder his brother.
00:06:38.800 But for Christians, love is defined
00:06:41.979 by giving up one's life as a sacrifice
00:06:44.110 for the well-being of others.
00:06:46.360 That's what Jesus did, and when God's
00:06:48.400 children trust in that love for them
00:06:51.430 it changes them. And so, John warns once
00:06:54.430 again of the deceivers. This time he
00:06:56.289 calls them "false prophets". When they deny
00:06:58.629 Jesus is the Messiah, they apparently
00:07:00.909 claim to speak for God but John says to
00:07:03.490 test the spirits. If anyone claims to
00:07:06.610 speak on God's behalf but doesn't focus
00:07:09.220 on Jesus as the Crucified Son of God,
00:07:11.949 they do not speak for God, John says.
00:07:14.770 God's true children will Center their
00:07:17.440 whole lives on the crucified and risen
00:07:19.509 Jesus because that's where we see God's
00:07:22.750 true heart revealed. We see on the cross
00:07:25.300 that God is a being of total self giving
00:07:28.479 love, and that love is what compels
00:07:30.940 Jesus's followers to love others in the
00:07:33.069 same way. And when people meet this God
00:07:35.889 of love it does away with fear and angst
00:07:38.740 foreve. Which is part of what John means
00:07:41.229 by "having victory over the world". When
00:07:43.779 you realize that God so loves you that
00:07:47.289 he is crazy about you despite your
00:07:49.300 deepest flaws and failures, that love
00:07:52.389 becomes the thing that grounds your
00:07:54.400 entire life.
00:07:55.990 This love is what comes through trusting
00:07:58.029 in the crucified Jesus, it comes through
00:08:00.610 trusting God's testimony about Jesus
00:08:03.159 given by the Spirit and is trusting in
00:08:05.110 the message from the Apostles about
00:08:06.909 Jesus. And when God's love gets ahold of you
00:08:10.090 it opens up eternal life.It's a life
00:08:12.849 permeated with God's own presence and
00:08:15.310 life and love and it begins now carrying
00:08:18.460 on into eternity .And so, this leads John
00:08:21.039 to the climactic conclusion of his
00:08:22.810 sermon. He says: "We know the Son of God
00:08:25.629 has come
00:08:26.830 and so we can know the one who is true
00:08:29.529 and we are in the one who is true in his
00:08:33.370 son Jesus the Messiah. This is the true
00:08:37.029 God and eternal life."
00:08:39.159 Now if your heads kind of spinning after
00:08:41.229 hearing that sentence and you're
00:08:42.610 wondering ."wait, who is the one who is
00:08:44.470 true?
00:08:45.290 Who is the one who gives true life? Is
00:08:47.779 that Jesus or is it God?". And John's
00:08:50.060 answer is of course: "Yes". John doesn't
00:08:52.579 know any God apart from Jesus and when
00:08:54.920 he and the other apostles encountered
00:08:56.899 Jesus they discovered the God who loves
00:08:59.420 us so deeply that He has chosen not
00:09:02.000 exist without us
00:09:03.889 despite our failures. And this God is so
00:09:06.589 surprising,
00:09:07.610 so unexpected, that John's final words
00:09:10.130 call us to keep away from idols. That is
00:09:12.949 to resist any temptation to remake the
00:09:16.220 surprising God in our own image, to know
00:09:18.949 Jesus is to know the God of creative
00:09:22.190 life giving others centered love. This,
00:09:25.399 John says, is the one true God and that's
00:09:29.300 what the letters of John are all about.
