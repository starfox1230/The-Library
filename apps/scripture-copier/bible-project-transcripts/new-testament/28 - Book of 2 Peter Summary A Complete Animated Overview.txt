00:00:02.580 The second letter of Peter.
00:00:05.040 It is addressed to the same network of churches as Peters first letter
00:00:08.620 and is likely written from the same location in Rome.
00:00:11.120 Peter has become aware of the fact that he is going to die soon.
00:00:14.040 The evidence that we have from early tradition
00:00:16.219 was that Peter was executed by the Roman authorities during the reign of Emperor Nero.
00:00:21.200 So this letter acts as Peter's farewell speech.
00:00:24.440 He begins by offering a final challenge that Jesus' followers must be people who never stop growing.
00:00:30.740 This is followed by two final warnings about a growing number of corrupt teachers
00:00:35.620 who are leading Christians in these church communities astray,
00:00:39.300 first, by their corrupt way of life
00:00:41.320 and second, by their distorted theology.
00:00:43.640 Throughout the letter, Peter is countering accusations made by these teachers against himself and the other apostles.
00:00:50.220 Peter's goal is to restore confidence and order to these church communities.
00:00:55.220 Peter opens by reminding these churches that through Jesus,
00:00:58.680 God has invited people to become a participant in his own divine nature.
00:01:03.640 That is, to share in God's own eternal life and love,
00:01:07.300 which is mind-blowing and requires a life-long response.
00:01:11.980 To receive this gift means a commitment to developing the same character traits that mark God's own divine nature.
00:01:19.460 Peter lists here seven traits to strive for.
00:01:22.860 The final one encompasses and crowns all of the others
00:01:26.780 It is love which, according to Jesus,
00:01:29.480 means devoting oneself to the well-being of others no matter their response or the cost.
00:01:35.400 To love, according to Peter, is to share in God's own life.
00:01:39.600 Peter then states the letter's purpose.
00:01:41.680 It is going to act as a memorial of his teaching that can be passed on to later generations
00:01:47.220 because he is not going to be around to give it much longer in person.
00:01:50.200 Before he dies he wants to address these objections and accusations
00:01:54.160 being made by the teachers who distort Jesus' teaching and that of the apostles.
00:01:59.180 Peter first addresses an accusation repeated by the skeptics, present and future.
00:02:04.220 Namely, that he and the apostles just made up all of this stuff about Jesus being risen from the dead and king of the world.
00:02:11.260 Jesus is not really going to come back one day.
00:02:13.750 So Peter offers his eyewitness testimony of the powerful moment of Jesus' transformation on the mountain.
00:02:19.660 Remember the story in Mark chapter 9.
00:02:21.960 The apostle saw Jesus exalted as king.
00:02:25.400 His resurrection means that he is alive as king and will return to rescue our world one day.
00:02:30.980 So the future return of Jesus to bring God's kingdom
00:02:35.040 will fulfill what all the ancient scriptures have been pointing to all along.
00:02:39.900 The words of the Old Testament prophets are not fabricated fantasies.
00:02:43.959 Rather, through these human words of Scripture and through the human Jesus,
00:02:48.728 God himself has spoken to us.
00:02:51.380 Peter then moves on to address the threats raised by corrupt leaders in the church.
00:02:56.048 He focuses on more objections that they raise.
00:02:58.660 First, these teachers deny the idea of a final reckoning
00:03:02.380 when God's going to hold all people accountable for their choices.
00:03:05.640 This denial is what conveniently allows the teachers to ignore Jesus' teaching about money and sex
00:03:12.140 because they are making tons of profit by teaching in the churches.
00:03:15.400 Not to mention the fact that they are sleeping around.
00:03:17.840 Peter reminds the readers that God can and will meet rebellion with his justice.
00:03:23.760 He recalls three ancient examples when God did this.
00:03:26.860 He first mentions the story about the sons of God in Genesis 6
00:03:30.860 as it was interpreted in a popular Jewish work of the time called 1 Enoch.
00:03:35.500 1 Enoch says the sons of God are rebellious angels who crossed the line
00:03:39.880 and slept with women, earning God's judgment.
00:03:42.960 Peter then brings up the story of the ancient flood and then the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.
00:03:47.589 In each case there was a rebellion that led to divine judgment.
00:03:51.340 But, Peter says, God was always faithful to deliver his people.
00:03:56.080 He uses the story of Lot to provide an example.
00:03:58.840 Peter then connects these ancient stories to the teachers' corrupt way of life.
00:04:03.120 They, too, are after money and sex.
00:04:05.160 They despise God's authority and they lead other people to think that God doesn't care about moral decisions.
00:04:11.409 He says they teach a message of Christian freedom
00:04:13.920 and use it as a license to do whatever they want.
00:04:16.980 This is why Peter is going to bring up Paul's letters later on in Chapter 3.
00:04:21.120 It appears that these teachers have distorted Paul's message of liberation in Christ.
00:04:26.200 But that is not the kind of freedom Paul meant.
00:04:28.720 Peter makes clear that these teachers are not really free.
00:04:31.680 In reality, they are slaves to their bodily impulses.
00:04:35.220 The fact that they are Christians makes it even more tragic
00:04:38.140 because knowing Jesus' teaching makes them doubly accountable.
00:04:42.060 They have become pitiful examples of the ancient proverb
00:04:45.300 about a dog returning to its vomit and a washed pig going back to the mud.
00:04:49.920 Peter then addresses the reasoning behind the teachers denial of the final reckoning.
00:04:54.640 They say generations of God's people keep coming and passing away without seeing the fulfillment of their hopes.
00:05:00.800 Where is this promised return of Jesus?
00:05:04.260 Peter responds by showing how short-sighted this objection is.
00:05:08.580 Look around, he says, at this remarkable universe that we inhabit.
00:05:12.900 The fact that we exist at all means that at some moment in the past,
00:05:17.640 God's Word intervened in a dramatic way to bring something out of nothing
00:05:22.340 and to bring order out of chaos, and he can do so again.
00:05:26.160 The real question is, why is God taking so long?
00:05:30.120 Peter reminds us that our human conception of time is extremely limited.
00:05:35.220 The long expanses of time through which God works do not fit neatly into the framework of our very short lives.
00:05:42.860 These long amounts of time are actually a sign of God's patience.
00:05:46.260 Each generation is offered the chance to recognize its own selfishness, to humble itself, and repent before God's generous grace.
00:05:54.280 God's grace will bring the story to a close on the day of the Lord.
00:05:58.940 Here Peter draws upon the prophetic poetry of Isaiah and Zephaniah
00:06:02.880 who described the day of God's justice as a consuming fire.
00:06:07.040 Peter says the heavens will pass away and the stoicheia will melt by fire
00:06:12.760 This is a Greek word that could refer to the elements.
00:06:16.000 In this case, it means the dissolution of the material universe.
00:06:19.680 More likely, it refers to heavenly bodies, in other words, the stars.
00:06:24.440 That is what this word means in Isaiah chapter 34, where Peter is quoting from.
00:06:28.880 In that case, this line is a metaphor about the sky being peeled back, so to speak, before the God who sees all.
00:06:37.180 This is why Peter says the day of the Lord will result in the earth and all its works being exposed.
00:06:44.000 The ultimate purpose of God's consuming justice is not to scrap the material universe.
00:06:49.180 Rather, it is to expose evil and injustice and remove it so that a new kind of heavens and earth can emerge,
00:06:56.820 one that is permeated with righteousness, full of God's love
00:07:01.140 and people who know and love God and love their neighbor as themselves.
00:07:05.360 Peter concludes by saying this is the true Christian hope, that Jesus and all the apostles have been announcing,
00:07:11.580 including Paul whose writings can be misunderstood if you rip them out of context.
00:07:16.660 But all the apostles are on the same page.
00:07:19.420 So Peter ends his final address to the church.
00:07:23.000 The tone of 2 Peter feels really intense.
00:07:26.620 But his passion comes from a firm conviction that God loves this world
00:07:30.740 and he is determined to rescue it through Jesus.
00:07:33.780 This means that God's love must confront and deal with the sin and injustice that ruins his beloved world
00:07:40.960 In God's own time, he will do so, opening up a new future for humanity and for the universe itself.
00:07:48.380 2 Peter has a wide, expansive vision of hope for the whole world.
00:07:53.550 It challenges us to examine our everyday lives.
00:07:56.880 That is what the second letter of Peter is all about.
