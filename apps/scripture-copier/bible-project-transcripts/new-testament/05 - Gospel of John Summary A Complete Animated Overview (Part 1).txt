00:00:03.410 The Gospel According to John. It's one ofthe earliest accounts of Jesus' life
00:00:08.029 and we learn at the end of the book thatit comes from one of Jesus' closest
00:00:12.360 followers, called "the disciple whom Jesusloved." Now he appears many times in the story
00:00:17.270 itself and there's some debate aboutwhether it's John the Son of Zebedee,
00:00:20.510 one of the twelve, or a different John, wholived in Jerusalem and was known in the
00:00:25.189 later church as John the Elder. WhicheverJohn it was the book embodies his
00:00:29.330 eyewitness testimony and it's beenbrilliantly designed with a clear
00:00:33.320 purpose that he states near the end. Johnsays: "the story is written so that you may
00:00:37.700 come to believe that Jesus is theMessiah and that by believing you may
00:00:42.050 have life in his name." John believes thatthe Jesus you read about in this book is
00:00:47.239 alive and real, and that he can changeyour life forever.
00:00:51.949 The book's design is really cool. Itsfirst-half opens with an introductory
00:00:56.030 poem and short story that's followed bythen a big block of stories about Jesus
00:01:00.800 performing miraculous signs thatgenerate increasing controversy, and it
00:01:05.330 all culminates in his greatest sign: theraising of Lazarus which creates the
00:01:09.530 greatest controversy as Israel's leadersdecide to kill Jesus. And that launches
00:01:14.030 into the book second half. These chaptersfocus on Jesus' final night and last
00:01:18.530 words to his disciples which arefollowed by his arrest, trial, death, and
00:01:22.700 resurrection. The book concludes with anepilogue. In this video we're just going
00:01:26.630 to focus on the first half. So the bookopens with a two-part introduction.
00:01:30.380 First a poem that begins, "In thebeginning was the Word" an obvious
00:01:35.060 allusion to Genesis 1 when God createdeverything with his word. Now a person's
00:01:39.620 words, they're distinct from that person,but they're also the embodiment of that
00:01:44.570 person's mind and will and so John saysthat God's Word was with God (that is
00:01:50.660 distinct) and yet the Word was God (thatis divine) and as we ponder this claim we
00:01:56.810 hear later in the poem that this DivineWord became human in Jesus, then John
00:02:01.640 goes on to draw from the stories ofExodus saying that Jesus was God's
00:02:05.960 Tabernacle in our midst. The gloriousdivine presence that hovered over the
00:02:10.280 Ark of the Covenant became a human inJesus, which leads to his last claim that
00:02:15.920 the one true God of Israel consists of God the
00:02:19.640 Father and the Son who has become human
00:02:22.760 to reveal the Father to us. Now as weconsider these mind-bending claims we
00:02:26.990 then start to hear a story about howJohn the Baptist first met Jesus and
00:02:31.280 then led other people to meet him andbecome his disciples and one by one as
00:02:35.960 people encounter Jesus they say out loudwho they think he is and in this one
00:02:40.430 chapter Jesus is given seven titles. Nowthese titles prepare us for John's love
00:02:45.770 of sevens in designing the book butaltogether they also make a claim that
00:02:50.270 this fully human Jesus from Nazareth isthe Messianic King, he's the teacher of
00:02:55.760 Israel, and he's the son of God who willdie for the sins of the world.
00:03:00.680 Now that's a big claim to make aboutsomeone and John will now go on to
00:03:05.040 support it through the stories inchapters 2 through 12.
00:03:07.430 They all have the same basic pattern;Jesus will perform a sign or make a
00:03:11.360 claim about himself and that will resultin misunderstanding or controversy and
00:03:16.190 so in the end of each story people areforced to make a choice about who they
00:03:20.420 think Jesus is. The first section showsJesus encountering four classic Jewish
00:03:25.220 institutions and in each case
00:03:27.260 Jesus shows that he is the reality towhich that institution pointed. So Jesus
00:03:32.360 is at a wedding party and the wine runsout and Jesus then turns these huge jugs
00:03:37.250 of water like a hundred and twentygallons total into the best wine ever
00:03:41.660 and the head waiter says to the groom:"you've saved the best wine for last,"
00:03:46.820 which is of course true, but John alsocalls this miracle Jesus' first sign; in
00:03:52.880 other words it's a symbol that revealssomething about Jesus. So just as Isaiah
00:03:57.680 said that the Messianic Kingdom would belike this huge party with lots of good
00:04:01.970 wine, so this first miraculous signreveals the generosity of Jesus'
00:04:06.800 Kingdom. Next Jesus goes to the JerusalemTemple (the place where heaven and earth
00:04:10.820 were supposed to come together and Godwould meet with his people) and Jesus
00:04:14.720 asserts his authority over it: runningout all the money exchangers, stopping
00:04:19.070 the sacrificial offerings; and when thetemple leaders threaten him he says,
00:04:22.700 "destroy this temple and I will raise itagain in three days."
00:04:26.570 Jesus is claiming that his comingsacrificial death
00:04:30.289 is where heaven and earth will trulymeet together. His body that will be
00:04:33.979 killed is the reality to which thetemple building points. Then Jesus has
00:04:38.659 this all night conversation with a rabbinamed Nicodemus who thinks that Jesus is
00:04:43.099 just like him, another rabbi and teacherfor Israel, but Jesus says that Israel
00:04:47.869 needs much more than just anotherteacher with new information,
00:04:51.440 Israel needs a new heart and a new lifeor in his words, "no one can experience
00:04:57.319 God's kingdom without being born again."Jesus believes that humans are caught in
00:05:02.509 a web of selfishness and sin that leadsto death, but he also knows that God
00:05:07.819 loves this world and so he's here tooffer people a new birth, a new chance at
00:05:13.129 life. From here Jesus travels north andhe ends up at a sacred well in a
00:05:17.389 conversation with a Samaritan (that isa non-Jewish woman) and they start
00:05:20.930 talking about water, which Jesus turnsinto a metaphor for himself. He says he's
00:05:26.240 here to bring living water that canbecome a source of eternal life. Now in
00:05:30.619 John this term refers to a new qualityof life, one that's infused with God's
00:05:35.689 eternal love and it's a life that canbegin now
00:05:39.139 and last on into the future. After this,John has designed another collection of
00:05:43.099 stories that took place during fourJewish sacred days or feasts, and again
00:05:47.809 Jesus uses the images related to thefeasts to make claims about himself.
00:05:52.399 So Jesus first heals a paralyzed man onthe Sabbath, which starts a controversy
00:05:56.809 with the Jewish leaders about working onthe day of rest, and Jesus says it's his
00:06:01.069 Father who's working on the Sabbath andso is he
00:06:04.669 and they catch his meaning, that he wascalling God his father making himself
00:06:08.330 equal with God, and so they want to killhim.
00:06:12.019 The next story takes place duringPassover (the feast that retold the
00:06:15.229 Exodus story with the symbolic meal ofthe Lamb and bread and wine) and Jesus
00:06:19.969 miraculously provides food for a crowdof thousands which results in people
00:06:24.289 asking him for more bread and then Jesusgoes on to claim that he is the true
00:06:28.519 bread and if they eat him
00:06:30.620 they will discover eternal life; and thisoffends many people who stop following him.
00:06:36.389 After this is the block of stories setin Jerusalem during the Feast of
00:06:40.090 Tabernacles (which retold the story ofIsrael's wilderness wanderings as God
00:06:45.189 guided them with the pillar of cloud andfire and provided them water in the
00:06:49.360 desert) and Jesus gets up in the templecourts and he shouts, "if anyone is thirsty
00:06:53.740 let them come to me and drink." And thenlater he says, "I am the light of the world."
00:06:59.949 He's claiming to be the illuminatingpresence of God and the life-saving gift
00:07:05.110 of God to his people, and some peoplebelieve and follow him but others are
00:07:09.250 offended and still others try to killhim for these exalted claims. The final
00:07:14.469 feast story is during Hanukkah (whichmeans rededication). It's about how Judah
00:07:18.909 Maccabee cleared the temple of idols andset it apart as Holy once more, and Jesus
00:07:23.530 goes into the temple area and says thathe is the one whom God has set apart as
00:07:28.750 the Holy One, and that he is the truetemple where God's presence dwells, and
00:07:33.490 he also says, "I and the Father are one."
00:07:36.430 This makes the Jerusalem leaders soangry they set in motion a plan to kill
00:07:40.569 Jesus and so he retreats from the city.Now all these conflicts they culminate
00:07:44.919 in one last miraculous sign. Jesus hearsthat his dear friend Lazarus was sick,
00:07:50.169 but his family lives near Jerusalemwhich is now a death trap for Jesus. Now
00:07:55.750 Jesus could stay away and he would savehis own life, but he loves Lazarus. So
00:08:01.479 once he hears that Lazarus has died hegoes to raise him from the dead and he
00:08:05.919 calls him to life out of this tombknowing that it will cost him his own
00:08:10.150 life. And the news of this amazing sign,it spreads quickly of course, and just as
00:08:15.129 Jesus knew would happen, the Jerusalemleaders hear about it and begin to
00:08:18.969 conspiring to murder him and so he ridesinto Jerusalem as Israel's King who's
00:08:24.580 rejected by its leaders. So the firsthalf of John draws to a close with this
00:08:29.169 story about Jesus laying down his lifeas an act of love for his friend and
00:08:34.510 this of course is also a sign pointingforward to the cross which we'll explore
00:08:39.100 more in the next video but for nowthat's the first half of the Gospel of John.
