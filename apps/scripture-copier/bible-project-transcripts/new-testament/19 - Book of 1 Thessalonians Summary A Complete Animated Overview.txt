00:00:02.820 Paul's first letter to the Thessalonians
00:00:05.780 This is most likely the earliest letter that we have from Paul.
00:00:09.280 The backstory for it is found in the book of Acts.
00:00:11.820 It is where Paul and his coworker Silas went to the ancient Greek city of Thessalonica.
00:00:16.620 After just one month of telling people the good news about Jesus,
00:00:20.300 a large number of Jewish and Greek people gave their allegiance to Jesus.
00:00:24.580 They form the first church community there.
00:00:27.340 But trouble was brewing.
00:00:29.280 Paul's announcement of the risen Jesus as the true Lord of the world led to suspicion.
00:00:34.980 So the Christians in Thessalonica were eventually accused of defying Caesar, the Roman Emperor,
00:00:40.560 when they said that there is another King: Jesus.
00:00:44.020 This led to a persecution that got so intense Paul and Silas actually had to flee from the city.
00:00:49.269 This was painful for them because they love the people there so much.
00:00:53.946 This letter is Paul's attempt to reconnect with the Christians in Thessalonica after he got a report from Timothy
00:01:00.500 that they were doing more than okay; they were flourishing despite this intense persecution.
00:01:05.820 He designed the letter to have two main movements.
00:01:08.100 First is a celebration of their faithfulness to Jesus.
00:01:11.110 Then he challenges them to keep growing as followers of Jesus.
00:01:15.300 Then these two movements are surrounded by three prayers.
00:01:18.840 The letter opens with a thanksgiving prayer.
00:01:21.180 The two movements are linked together by a transitional prayer.
00:01:24.280 Then the whole thing is concluded with a final prayer.
00:01:27.400 It is a beautiful design.
00:01:29.160 Paul opens by giving thanks and celebrating the Thessalonians' faith,
00:01:32.900 their love for others and their hope in Jesus, despite persecution
00:01:37.001 He goes on to retell the story of their conversion, how they used to be idolatrous polytheists.
00:01:42.681 They were living in a culture where all of life was permeated by institutions and practices
00:01:48.081 that honored the Greek and Roman gods.
00:01:50.200 Paul talks about how they turned away from those idols to serve the living and true God
00:01:55.560 and that they are now waiting for the coming of God's Son from heaven.
00:01:58.920 In a city like Thessalonica, transferring your allegiance to the Creator God of Israel and to King Jesus came at a cost:
00:02:07.220 isolation from your neighbors, hostility from your family...
00:02:10.500 But for the Thessalonians, the overwhelming love of Jesus who died for them,
00:02:15.540 and the hope of his return it made it all worth it.
00:02:18.660 Paul then retells the story of his mission in Thessalonica and of the dear friendships he formed with the people.
00:02:24.770 He uses really intimate metaphors here.
00:02:27.500 They treated him like their child and he became like their mother and like their father.
00:02:32.720 He says, we were happy to share with you not only the good news from God, but our very selves, because we came to dearly love you.
00:02:40.960 Paul reminds us here that the essence of Christian leadership is not about power and having influence.
00:02:47.740 It is about healthy relationships and humble, loving service.
00:02:51.780 He reminds them that he never asked for money.
00:02:54.240 He simply came to love and serve them in the name of Jesus.
00:02:58.540 Paul moves on to reflect on their common persecution.
00:03:01.660 Just like Jesus was rejected and killed by his own people,
00:03:04.840 so now Paul is persecuted by his fellow Jews,
00:03:07.740 and the Thessalonians are facing hostility from their Greek neighbors.
00:03:11.460 Paul draws a strange comfort from knowing that, together,
00:03:15.200 their sufferings are a way of participating in the story of Jesus' own life and death.
00:03:20.420 Paul then shares about the anguish he experienced when he heard of the hardships the Thessalonians had after he and Silas fled.
00:03:28.080 So he sent Timothy to support them and see how they were doing.
00:03:31.160 To his joy, Timothy discovered that they were going strong.
00:03:34.480 They were faithful to Jesus.
00:03:36.000 They were full of love for God and their neighbors.
00:03:38.840 And they longed to see Paul as much as he longed to see them.
00:03:42.540 Paul concludes with a prayer for endurance.
00:03:45.080 What is cool is that he introduces here the topics he is going to address in the letter's second half.
00:03:50.340 He prays that God will grow their capacity to love,
00:03:53.100 that he will strengthen their commitment to holiness as they fix their hope on the return of King Jesus
00:03:58.800 He opens the letter's second movement by challenging them to a life that is consistent with the teachings of Jesus.
00:04:05.040 This means, first of all, a serious commitment to holiness and sexual purity.
00:04:10.560 In contrast to the promiscuous, sexually destructive culture around them,
00:04:14.800 they are to follow Jesus' teaching about experiencing the beauty and the power of sex
00:04:19.870 within the haven of a committed marriage covenant relationship
00:04:23.570 God takes sexual misbehavior seriously, Paul says.
00:04:27.380 It dishonours and destroys people, their dignity.
00:04:30.880 Following Jesus also means a commitment to loving and serving others.
00:04:34.880 Paul instructs them that Christians should be known in the city as reliable people who work really hard,
00:04:41.320 not just to make money but so that they can have resources to provide for themselves
00:04:45.860 and to generously share with people who are in need.
00:04:49.200 After this, Paul addresses a number of questions the Thessalonians had raised about the future hope of Jesus' return.
00:04:55.840 Some Christians in the church had recently died, most likely killed as martyrs.
00:05:00.820 Their friends and family are wondering about their fate when Jesus returns.
00:05:04.760 So Paul makes it clear that, despite their grief and loss, not even death can separate Christians from the love of Jesus.
00:05:11.900 When he returns as king, he will call both the living and the dead to himself.
00:05:16.560 Paul uses a really cool image here.
00:05:18.600 He uses language that would normally describe how a city, subject to the Roman Caesar,
00:05:23.280 would send out a delegation to welcome or meet his arrival.
00:05:27.620 Paul then applies this imagery to the arrival of King Jesus.
00:05:32.000 He, too, will be greeted by a delegation of his people who will go to meet the Lord in the air
00:05:37.380 as they welcome and escort him back to this world where he will establish his kingdom of justice and peace.
00:05:44.060 Paul then wants the Thessalonians to see how this hope should motivate faithfulness to Jesus.
00:05:49.680 So, he pokes fun at the famous Roman propaganda that it is Caesar who brings peace and security.
00:05:55.800 Of course, Rome's peace came through violence, through enslaving their enemies and military occupation.
00:06:01.480 Paul warns that Jesus will return as King one day and confront this kind of injustice.
00:06:07.280 Followers of King Jesus should live in the present as if that future day is already here.
00:06:13.480 Despite the night time of human evil around them, they should stay sober and awake as the light of God's kingdom.
00:06:20.080 Dawn is here on earth as it is in heaven.
00:06:23.280 Paul closes all of these exhortations like he began, with a hopeful prayer that God would permeate their lives with his holiness
00:06:30.820 that he would set them apart to be completely devoted and blameless until the return of King Jesus.
00:06:37.720 First Thessalonians reminds us that, from the very beginning,
00:06:41.040 following Jesus as king has produced a truly countercultural or holy way of life.
00:06:47.620 This will sometimes generate suspicion and conflict among our neighbors.
00:06:51.520 The response of Jesus' followers to such hostility should always be love,
00:06:56.720 meeting opposition with grace and generosity.
00:06:59.940 This way of life is motivated by hope in the coming kingdom of Jesus
00:07:04.880 that has already begun in his resurrection from the dead.
00:07:08.283 So holiness, love and future hope:
00:07:11.766 that is what 1 Thessalonians is all about.
