00:00:03.420 The letter of Jude.
00:00:04.580 Or more accurately, Judah, according to the pronunciation of his name both in Greek and in Hebrew.
00:00:10.160 Judah was one of Jesus' four brothers who are named in the Gospel accounts.
00:00:14.180 None of the brothers followed Jesus as the Messiah before his death
00:00:17.960 but afterwards they saw him alive from the dead and then became his disciples.
00:00:22.200 All these brothers of Jesus became leaders eventually in the first Jewish Christian communities.
00:00:27.360 And Judah was known as a travelling teacher and missionary.
00:00:30.320 And this gives us the background to understand the purpose of his letter.
00:00:33.640 We don't know what specific church community he wrote to
00:00:36.540 but it was likely made up of mostly Messianic Jews
00:00:39.600 His writing style assumes a deep knowledge of the Hebrew Old Testament Scriptures
00:00:44.500 as well as other popular Jewish literature.
00:00:47.300 Jude had become aware of a crisis facing this church
00:00:50.220 and so this helps us understand the letter's design.
00:00:52.900 It begins with an opening charge followed by a long warning and accusation against corrupt teachers
00:00:58.540 who had influenced this church.
00:01:00.260 And then Judah closes by completing the charge about what this church is supposed to do.
00:01:04.940 Judah begins by charging this church to contend for the true Christian faith.
00:01:09.429 He says his plan was to write a longer work that explored our shared salvation through the Messiah.
00:01:15.340 But that project, he says, got delayed when he heard the urgent news about this church
00:01:19.900 and so he fired off this very thoughtful but very short letter.
00:01:23.400 Judah doesn't begin with how they're supposed to contend for the faith.
00:01:26.880 Rather, he first goes into why.
00:01:29.360 It's because of the corrupt teachers who have infiltrated this church.
00:01:32.820 And it's not their teaching that he targets but their way of life.
00:01:36.620 Their moral compromise is what tells you they have bad theology.
00:01:40.920 First of all, they've distorted God's grace as a license to sin.
00:01:44.560 They think that they're forgiven and they have God's Spirit, so now they can do whatever they want,
00:01:49.020 especially when it comes to money and sex.
00:01:51.820 And so Judah says they betray Jesus by rejecting his authority and his teachings.
00:01:57.340 And Judah wants this church to know that the appearance of these teachers is no surprise.
00:02:02.100 He transitions into a longer warning to stay away from them.
00:02:05.560 He first offers two sets of three Old Testament examples.
00:02:09.580 The first trio is about rebellious people who in the past receive divine justice.
00:02:14.840 So the Israelites who rebelled against God in the wilderness, they got what they wanted
00:02:19.260 and they died out in the middle of nowhere.
00:02:21.820 Then he brings up a story about angels who are imprisoned for rebellion until they face God's justice.
00:02:27.820 He's referring to the interpretation of the story inGenesis 6
00:02:31.180 offered in the popular Jewish work called 1 Enoch, where the sons of God are interpreted to refer to angels
00:02:37.760 who rebelled against God, then had sex with women and were judged accordingly.
00:02:42.440 Judah links this story to his third example about the ruin of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis,
00:02:47.520 where violent men tried to have sex with angels.
00:02:50.360 Both these stories are about rebellion against God's order that led to sexual immorality.
00:02:55.860 And that's precisely what the corrupt teachers are guilty of.
00:02:58.780 After this, Judah brings up a bonus example from a popular Jewish text called the Testament of Moses.
00:03:04.820 Like Enoch, it was not part of the Old Testament scriptures.
00:03:07.860 And it was a creative retelling of Moses' final days and words, based on Deuteronomy.
00:03:13.400 In the section that Judah quotes from, Moses has died and there's a good angel, Michael,
00:03:18.200 who is refuting the devil's accusations against Moses.
00:03:21.460 But he decides to leave final judgment for God alone.
00:03:25.520 Now, these stories might seem kind of odd to you,
00:03:28.020 but for Jewish people who were raised on this literature, Judah's warnings make good sense.
00:03:33.080 The behavior of these corrupt teachers has ancient roots:
00:03:36.260 rebellion against God's authority, sexual immorality, rejecting God's messengers.
00:03:41.280 And this connects to the second trio of examples.
00:03:43.780 They're all about rebels who went on to corrupt other people.
00:03:47.280 So Cain, he murdered his brother but then he went on to build a city where violence reigned.
00:03:52.420 Balaam the sorcerer, he couldn't curse Israel and so he lured them into idolatry and sexual corruption.
00:03:58.940 And then Korah, the Levite, he led a rebellion against Moses that ended in disaster for others.
00:04:04.560 Judah concludes the second trio with a barrage of Old Testament images to describe the teachers.
00:04:10.100 They're like the selfish shepherds of Ezekiel.
00:04:12.900 Or like the clouds with no rain from Proverbs.
00:04:15.540 Or like the chaotic waves from Isaiah.
00:04:18.040 Their self absorption betrays their claim to follow Jesus.
00:04:21.839 They create chaos wherever they go.
00:04:24.580 Judah concludes his warning by quoting from two other warnings: one ancient and one recent.
00:04:29.940 The first comes again from the popular book of1 Enoch,
00:04:33.620 which claimed to contain the visions of the ancient figure, Enoch, from the book of Genesis.
00:04:38.080 Now what's fascinating is Judah quotes from the opening chapter of Enoch
00:04:42.360 which is itself quoting about half a dozen Old Testament texts
00:04:45.460 about the final day of the Lord's justice on human evil.
00:04:49.580 Judah then matches Enoch's ancient warning with a more recent one from the apostles.
00:04:54.860 Peter, John, Paul, they all predicted that corrupt teachers would arise and distort the good news about Jesus.
00:05:01.920 And they themselves were echoing Jesus' early warning about the same thing.
00:05:06.560 And so this church should need no more convincing.
00:05:09.260 These teachers have to be dealt with.
00:05:12.280 So Judah then moves into his closing charge.
00:05:14.420 He picks up his opening line about contending for the faith
00:05:17.460 and he unpacks how to do so with a cool set of metaphors.
00:05:21.100 He describes the community of Jesus as God's new temple.
00:05:24.880 And so they are to build their lives on the foundation of the most holy faith
00:05:29.600 which refers to the core message of good news about Jesus' life, death and resurrection for our sins.
00:05:35.960 On that foundation, the church is to build itself through a dedication to prayer,
00:05:41.400 by devoting itself to the love of God, through obedience.
00:05:45.040 And the integrity of this building will be maintained
00:05:47.760 by staying alert for the return of Jesus to bring his justice and His mercy.
00:05:52.720 And in doing this, they will help each other stay faithful to Jesus.
00:05:56.800 Judah then concludes by praising the God who will protect his people
00:06:00.740 and keep them from falling too far from his grace.
00:06:03.680 The short letter of Judah is powerful and puzzling for many modern readers
00:06:08.020 who ask why he quotes from texts that aren't today considered part of the Hebrew Bible,
00:06:12.160 like 1 Enoch or the Testament of Moses.
00:06:14.860 It's important to remember that Jewish culture in this time was immersed in religious texts.
00:06:20.140 Jesus, his family, all the early Jewish Christians, grew up reading the Hebrew Bible
00:06:25.120 along with many later books that were based on and inspired by the Scriptures.
00:06:29.760 And we know there were ancient debates
00:06:31.671 about whether or not some of these later books should be viewed as Scripture.
00:06:36.000 But regardless, they're still important.
00:06:38.600 A book doesn't have to be in the Bible to speak an important message to God's people.
00:06:43.280 And so we have many Jewish texts from this period.
00:06:45.740 They're known today as the collections of the Apocrypha, also called the Deutero-Canon,
00:06:50.380 along with the pseudepigrapha.
00:06:52.040 These were all preserved and read in Jewish and Christian communities.
00:06:55.500 They were treated with great respect.
00:06:57.920 It doesn't mean they were originally designed as part of the Hebrew Bible
00:07:01.520 but they are part of the biblical tradition.
00:07:04.240 And so Judah, knowing his readers, that they would value words from 1 Enoch,
00:07:08.720 he used them to communicate his message,
00:07:11.000 which is this: God's grace through Jesus demands a whole life response, not just intellectual assent.
00:07:18.140 Notice that Judah doesn't criticize or focus on the teachers' theology
00:07:22.160 but their immoral way of life which denies Jesus.
00:07:25.960 And so Judah is here applying what Jesus first told his disciples:
00:07:29.640 if you really love me, then you will obey my teachings.
00:07:33.500 For Christians, how you live is the most reliable indicator of what you actually believe.
00:07:39.740 And that's what the letter of Jude is all about.
