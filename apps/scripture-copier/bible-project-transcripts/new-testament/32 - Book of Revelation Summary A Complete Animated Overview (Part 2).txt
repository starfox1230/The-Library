# https://www.youtube.com/watch/QpnIrbq2bKo

00:00:03.100 The Revelation of Jesus given to John the prophet.
00:00:06.020 In the first video, we explored how John composed this apocalyptic prophecy
00:00:10.200 as a circular letter to seven churches in Asia Minor to challenge and comfort these Christians
00:00:15.820 who were suffering from apathy and persecution under the Roman Empire.
00:00:19.860 We also encountered John's main symbol for Jesus: the slain Lamb
00:00:23.940 who conquered his enemies by dying for them.
00:00:26.900 He is the one who opens up the scroll containing God's purposes to bring his kingdom on earth as in heaven.
00:00:33.340 The scroll's opening brought warning judgments like the plagues of Egypt.
00:00:37.000 And like Pharaoh, the nations do not repent.
00:00:39.780 And then John introduced the multi-ethnic army of the Lamb
00:00:43.120 and the opened scroll revealed their strange mission.
00:00:46.320 It's to follow the Lamb
00:00:47.840 by bearing witness to God's justice and mercy before the beastly nations, even if it kills them.
00:00:53.980 And they will conquer the beast by laying down their lives, just like the Lamb.
00:00:58.780 And this will move the nations to repentance.
00:01:00.920 In the remainder of the book,
00:01:01.920 John will fill out his portrayal of this beast and his war on God's people and how the whole story ends.
00:01:08.280 After the seven trumpets, John stops the drumbeat of sevens with a series of visions that he calls "signs".
00:01:14.780 The word literally means "symbols"
00:01:16.540 and these chapters are full of them.
00:01:18.540 These visions explore the message of the open scroll in greater depth.
00:01:22.520 The first one reveals the cosmic spiritual battle
00:01:25.520 that lay behind the suffering of the seven churches under Roman persecution.
00:01:30.060 It's a manifestation of that ancient conflict that began in Genesis chapter 3.
00:01:35.220 The serpent, who represents the source of all evil, is depicted here as a dragon.
00:01:40.740 It attacks a woman and her seed.
00:01:43.220 They represent the Messiah and his people.
00:01:45.325 Then the Messiah defeats the dragon through his death and resurrection and it's cast to earth.
00:01:50.440 There the dragon inspires hatred and persecution of the Messiah's people.
00:01:54.900 But they will conquer the dragon by resisting his influence, even if it kills them.
00:01:59.600 John's trying to show the churches that neither Rome nor any other nation or human is the real enemy.
00:02:05.980 There are dark spiritual powers at work
00:02:08.500 and Jesus' followers will announce Jesus' victory
00:02:11.600 by remaining faithful and loving their enemies just like the slain Lamb.
00:02:16.200 John's next vision retells the story of the same conflict,
00:02:19.120 but this time in the earthly symbolism of Daniel's animal visions.
00:02:23.380 John sees two beasts empowered by the dragon.
00:02:25.880 One of them represents national military power that conquers through violence.
00:02:29.900 The other beast symbolizes the economic propaganda machine that exalts this power as divine.
00:02:35.520 And these beasts demand full allegiance from the nations
00:02:38.720 and that's symbolized by taking the mark of the beast and his number, 666, on the forehead or hand.
00:02:45.400 Now, this is an infamous image
00:02:47.740 and you won't discover its meaning by reading news headlines.
00:02:51.240 John's making a clear Hebrew Old Testament reference here.
00:02:54.580 First of all, this mark is the anti-Shema.
00:02:57.580 The writing on the forehead in hand, it's a clear reference to the Shema,
00:03:01.440 an ancient Jewish prayer of allegiance to God that's found in the Book of Deuteronomy.
00:03:05.880 This prayer also was written on the forehead and hand
00:03:08.640 as a symbol of devoting all your thoughts and actions to the one true God.
00:03:13.220 But now, the rebellious nations demand their own allegiance
00:03:16.360 and they force everyone to decide who they will follow.
00:03:19.800 Then there's the number of the beast, which has fascinated readers for thousands of years.
00:03:23.980 But this was not a mystery to John.
00:03:26.200 He spoke Hebrew and Greek.
00:03:27.780 And Hebrew letters were also numbers.
00:03:30.340 If you spell the Greek words "Nero Caesar" and the word "Beast" in Hebrew, each one amounts to 666.
00:03:38.160 Now, John isn't saying that Nero was the only fulfillment of this vision.
00:03:42.420 Nero is just a recent example of the ancient pattern set out by Daniel,
00:03:46.780 that the nations become beasts when they exalt their own power
00:03:50.840 and economic security as a false god and then demand total allegiance.
00:03:55.100 So Babylon was the beast in Daniel's day.
00:03:57.520 But that was followed by Persia, followed by Greece and now Rome in John's day.
00:04:02.260 And so it goes for any later nation that acts in the same way.
00:04:06.340 Standing opposed to the beastly nations and the dragon is another king.
00:04:10.100 It's the slain Lamb.
00:04:11.680 He's with his army who have given their lives to follow him.
00:04:15.100 And from the New Jerusalem, their song of victory goes out to the nations
00:04:18.940 and what John calls "the eternal gospel".
00:04:21.640 And they call everyone to repent and to worship God and to come out of Babylon that will fall.
00:04:27.260 Its days are numbered.
00:04:29.040 Then John sees a vision of final judgment.
00:04:31.880 It's symbolized by two harvests.
00:04:33.839 One is a good harvest of grain as King Jesus comes to gather up his faithful people to himself.
00:04:38.990 The other is a harvest of wine grapes.
00:04:41.510 It represents humanity's intoxication with evil.
00:04:44.620 They are taken to the winepress and trampled.
00:04:47.100 Now, throughout all these sign visions, John is placing a stark choice before the seven churches.
00:04:53.080 Will they resist the lure of Babylon and follow the Lamb?
00:04:56.660 Or will they follow the beast and suffer its defeat?
00:05:00.020 Now that the choice is clear, John replays a final cycle of seven divine judgments,
00:05:04.840 symbolized as pouring out seven bowls.
00:05:07.820 Now we know from the Lamb's scroll and from the sign visions that many among the nations do repent.
00:05:13.400 But as the Exodus plagues are repeated and poured out through the bowls,
00:05:17.080 there are many people who do not repent.
00:05:19.720 They resist and curse God just like Pharaoh.
00:05:22.780 And so it all leads up to the 6th bowl as the dragon and the beast, they gather the nations together
00:05:28.280 to make war against God's people in a place called Armageddon.
00:05:32.380 This refers to a plain in northern Israel where many battles were fought by Israel against invading nations.
00:05:38.320 And some people think that this sixth bowl refers to an actual future battle.
00:05:42.760 Other people think that it's a metaphor for God's final justice on evil.
00:05:46.660 Either way, John's clearly taken images from the book of Ezekiel about God's battle with Gog.
00:05:52.640 Gog was Ezekiel's symbol of the rebellious nations gathered before God to face his justice.
00:05:57.420 And that's what comes in the seventh bowl.
00:05:59.660 It's the fourth and final depiction of the day of the Lord
00:06:02.620 when evil is defeated among the nations once and for all.
00:06:06.220 Now, John has fully unpacked the message of the Lamb's unsealed scroll.
00:06:10.940 And now he goes back to expand on three key themes that he's introduced earlier:
00:06:15.260 the fall of Babylon,
00:06:16.680 the final battle to defeat evil,
00:06:18.560 and the arrival of the new Jerusalem.
00:06:20.930 And each one of these explores the final coming of God's kingdom from a different angle.
00:06:25.479 So first, the fall of Babylon.
00:06:27.080 An angel shows John a stunning woman who's dressed like a queen
00:06:31.540 but she's drunk with the blood of the martyrs and of all innocent people.
00:06:36.169 She's riding the dragon beast from the sign visions.
00:06:39.169 It's a symbol of the rebellious nations.
00:06:41.210 And she's called Babylon, the prostitute.
00:06:44.360 Now, the detailed symbols of this vision, they would be very clear to John's first readers.
00:06:49.120 He's personifying the military and economic power of the Roman Empire.
00:06:53.080 But he's also doing more.
00:06:54.680 In this vision, John has blended together words and images from every single Old Testament passage
00:07:00.740 about the downfall of ancient Babylon, Tyre and Edom.
00:07:04.440 John's showing how Rome is simply the newest version
00:07:07.340 of the Old Testament archetype of humanity in rebellion against God.
00:07:11.460 They come together and form nations that exalt their own economic and military security into a false god.
00:07:17.380 This isn't something limited to the past or the future.
00:07:20.960 It's a portrait of the human condition throughout history.
00:07:23.900 And Babylons will come and go,
00:07:25.740 leading up to the day when Jesus returns to replace Babylon with his kingdom.
00:07:30.380 But how will Jesus' kingdom come?
00:07:32.580 Up to this point, the day of the Lord has been depicted as a day of fire or earthquake or harvest
00:07:37.440 and now it's depicted as a final battle and it's told twice.
00:07:41.240 It results in the vindication of the martyrs.
00:07:43.420 Now John takes us back to the sixth bowl where the nations were gathered together to oppose God.
00:07:48.580 And all of a sudden, Jesus appears.
00:07:50.580 He's the great hero.
00:07:51.920 He's the Word of God riding on a white horse
00:07:54.720 and he's ready to conquer the world's evil, but pay attention!
00:07:58.189 He's covered with blood before the battle even begins.
00:08:01.700 And that's because it's his own.
00:08:03.680 And his only weapon is the sword of his mouth.
00:08:06.580 It's an image adapted from Isaiah.
00:08:08.540 John's telling us that Armageddon will not be a bloodbath.
00:08:11.420 Rather, the same Jesus who shed his own blood for his enemies now comes proclaiming justice.
00:08:17.320 He will hold accountable those who refuse to repent
00:08:19.920 of the ways that they participate in the ruin of God's good world
00:08:23.380 and the destructive hellfire that they've unleashed in God's world
00:08:27.440 justly becomes their own God-appointed destiny.
00:08:30.460 After this, John sees a vision of Jesus' followers who have been murdered by Babylon.
00:08:34.820 And they're brought back to life and they reign with the Messiah for 1,000 years.
00:08:39.080 Then after this, the dragon who inspired humanity's rebellion against God
00:08:43.440 rallies the nations of the world together to rebel against God's kingdom.
00:08:47.680 But before God's throne of justice, they all face the consequences of eternal defeat.
00:08:52.670 And so the forces of spiritual evil
00:08:54.480 and everyone who doesn't want to participate in God's kingdom are destroyed
00:08:58.900 They're given what they want: to exist by themselves and for themselves.
00:09:03.260 And so the dragon and Babylon and all who choose them are eternally quarantined,
00:09:08.740 never again able to corrupt God's new creation.
00:09:12.160 Now, there's a lot of debate about the relationship of the 1,000 years to these two battles.
00:09:16.900 There are some who think it refers to a literal chronological sequence:
00:09:20.460 Jesus' return, followed by a thousand-year kingdom on earth called the Millennium,
00:09:24.440 followed by God's final judgment.
00:09:26.460 Other people think that the thousand years
00:09:28.300 are a symbol of Jesus' and the martyrs' present victory over spiritual evil,
00:09:33.340 and that the two battles depict Jesus' future return from two different angles.
00:09:37.610 Whichever view you take, the main point is clear: when Jesus returns as king he will deal with evil forever
00:09:43.920 and he'll vindicate those who have been faithful to him.
00:09:46.640 The book concludes with a final vision of the marriage of heaven and earth.
00:09:50.320 An angel shows John a stunning bride
00:09:53.160 that symbolizes the new creation that has come forever to join God and his covenant people.
00:09:58.940 God announces that he's come to live with humanity forever and that he's making all things new.
00:10:05.600 John's vision here is a kaleidoscope of Old Testament promises.
00:10:09.350 This place is a new heavens and earth,
00:10:11.520 a restored creation that's healed of the pain and evil of human history.
00:10:15.880 It's also a new Garden of Eden, the paradise of eternal life with God.
00:10:20.570 But it's not simply a return back to the garden.
00:10:22.880 It's a step forward into a new Jerusalem, a great city
00:10:26.080 where human cultures and all their diversity work together in peace and harmony before God.
00:10:31.400 And then, the most surprising twist of all,
00:10:32.940 there's no temple building in the new creation because the presence of God
00:10:36.920 and the Lamb that were once limited to the temple now permeate every square inch of the new world.
00:10:42.780 And there's a new humanity there, fulfilling the calling placed on them
00:10:46.860 all the way back on page one of the Bible: to rule as God's image,
00:10:51.220 to partner together with God in taking this creation into new and uncharted territory.
00:10:56.400 And so ends John's apocalypse and the epic storyline of the whole Bible.
00:11:01.500 John did not write this book as a secret code for you to decipher the timetable of Jesus' return.
00:11:07.480 It's a symbolic vision that brought hope and challenge to the seven first century churches
00:11:12.760 and every generation of Christians since.
00:11:15.400 It reveals history's pattern and God's promise that every human kingdom eventually becomes Babylon
00:11:21.440 and must be resisted in the power of the slain Lamb.
00:11:24.800 But there's a promise that Jesus who loved and died for this world will not let Babylon go unchecked.
00:11:31.000 He will return one day to remove evil from his good world and make all things new.
00:11:36.960 And that is a promise that should motivate faithfulness
00:11:39.960 in every generation of God's people until the King returns.
00:11:44.060 That's what the book of Revelation is all about.
