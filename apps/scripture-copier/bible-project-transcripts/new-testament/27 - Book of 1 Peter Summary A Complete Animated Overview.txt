00:00:02.600 The first letter of Peter.
00:00:04.447 His name was Shim'on or Simon when he first became a follower of Jesus.
00:00:09.008 And he was part of the inner circle of the 12 disciples.
00:00:12.360 When he made his confession that Jesus was the Messiah, Jesus changed his name to Kephas
00:00:17.640 which is Aramaic for rock, which was later translated into Greek as Petros or Peter.
00:00:23.340 Jesus promised that he would become a leader among the apostles
00:00:26.660 to guide the Messianic community in Jerusalem through its earliest years,
00:00:30.700 and that's what happened
00:00:31.800 remember the early chapters of the book of Acts
00:00:34.000 Eventually, Peter was called to carry the good news of Jesus beyond the borders of Israel however
00:00:39.480 and this letter was written decades into that mission in the wider Roman world
00:00:43.880 We discover at the conclusion of this letter that Peter is in Rome which he called Babylon
00:00:49.080 and we learn that while Peter commissioned the letter
00:00:51.460 it was actually composed by a man named Silvanus who was a co-worker of Peter
00:00:55.820 This was a circular letter sent to multiple church communities
00:00:58.740 in the Roman province of Asia Minor which is modern day Turkey
00:01:02.500 and Peter learned that these mostly non-Jewish Christians were persecuted
00:01:06.220 They were facing hostility and harassment from their Greek and Roman neighbors
00:01:10.320 and so Peter wrote to encourage them in the midst of their suffering
00:01:13.820 And this helps explain the letter's design and its main themes.
00:01:17.240 It opens with the greeting
00:01:18.440 and then it moves into a poetic song of praise to God which introduces the key themes
00:01:23.210 that are explored in the main body of the letter
00:01:25.480 where he first affirms the new family identity of these persecuted Christians
00:01:29.880 which will help them see their suffering as a way to bear witness to Jesus
00:01:34.140 And this has a way of focusing their future hopes on the return of Jesus
00:01:38.380 Let's dive in and you'll just see how all the pieces work together
00:01:41.320 So Peter opened by greeting these churches as the chosen people of God who are exiled around the world.
00:01:47.420 Now Peter makes clear throughout the letter that these Christians he's writing to are Gentiles
00:01:51.720 But here he describes them with phrases from the Old Testament that describe
00:01:55.820 how God chose the people of Israel the family of Abraham who was himself an exile and wanderer
00:02:02.140 This is a key strategy that Peter repeats through the whole letter
00:02:05.000 he wants these suffering non-Jewish Christians to see that through Jesus they now belong to the family of Abraham
00:02:12.127 And so they're wandering exiles just like him misunderstood
00:02:15.163 they're mistreated and they're looking for their true home in the promised land
00:02:19.120 Peter continues this idea in the opening song
00:02:21.660 He praises God for causing people to be born again into a living hope through Jesus' resurrection in the power of the Spirit
00:02:28.900 God's inviting all people into a new family centered around Jesus
00:02:33.260 a family that has a new identity as God's beloved children and
00:02:37.160 who have a new hope of a world reborn by God's love when Jesus returns as king
00:02:42.860 And for people who have this hope suffering and persecution is actually a strange gift
00:02:48.220 because it burns away false hopes and distractions like a purifying fire
00:02:52.700 and it reminds us of our true home and hope
00:02:55.700 So paradoxically life's hardships actually deepen our faith
00:03:00.060 They make it more genuine
00:03:01.680 From here Peter is gonna' move on into the body of the letter
00:03:04.880 But he's gonna' explore all these ideas in greater depth
00:03:07.920 So he first develops the theme about the new family identity of God's people
00:03:11.980 He takes even more memorable Old Testament images about the family of Israel
00:03:16.260 Then he applies them to these Gentile Christians
00:03:19.160 So like the Israelites who left Egypt they too are to gird up their loins
00:03:23.860 and leave behind their former way of life on the way to a new future
00:03:27.960 So they are the holy people of God now who are journeying through the wilderness
00:03:32.740 They are the people of the new exodus who have been redeemed by the blood of Jesus who is the ultimate Passover lamb
00:03:39.160 They are the people of the new covenant who have God's word buried deep inside them
00:03:43.100 restoring their hearts and renewing their minds
00:03:45.660 They are the new temple built on the foundation of Jesus himself
00:03:49.440 And they are the new kingdom of priests who are serving God as his representatives to the nations
00:03:55.060 Now by applying all of these amazing images to these persecuted Gentile Christians
00:03:59.760 Peter is placing their suffering within a brand new story
00:04:03.180 And this leads into the next section
00:04:04.849 Their persecution can actually help bring clarity to their mission in the world
00:04:09.405 to bear witness to God's mercy among the nations
00:04:12.180 So Peter first encourages them to submit to Roman rule even if it's oppressive
00:04:17.220 Yes he acknowledges their persecution their suffering is unjust
00:04:21.959 But violent resistance solves nothing
00:04:24.540 Not to mention that it betrays the teachings of Jesus who loved his enemies instead of killing them
00:04:29.640 Peter then specifically highlights the very difficult situation that Christian slaves and wives faced
00:04:35.260 when they lived in Roman households where the patriarch did not follow Jesus
00:04:39.300 The problem was that it was expected that everyone in the household
00:04:42.720 would submit to and worship the patriarch's gods
00:04:45.980 And so Peter is aware that giving allegiance to Jesus will generate suspicion
00:04:49.960 So Peter says it's true
00:04:51.460 All Christians including Roman wives and slaves have been fully liberated by Jesus
00:04:57.220 But they are to demonstrate that freedom not through rebellion but by resisting evil the same way Jesus did
00:05:04.280 through showing love and generosity to your enemies
00:05:07.000 And in homes where the husband is also a Christian it's a different story
00:05:10.620 They are to treat their wives totally differently from the Roman neighbors
00:05:14.520 regarding them as equals before God who are worthy of honor and respect
00:05:19.080 And Peter's hopeful that this imitation of Jesus' love and upside down kingdom will give power to their words
00:05:25.200 as they bear witness to God's mercy and show people the beautiful truth about the way of Jesus
00:05:30.040 But Peter is also a realist
00:05:31.660 He knows that Christians will continue to be persecuted
00:05:34.520 So he reminds them of their future vindication
00:05:37.400 He recalls how Jesus himself was unfairly persecuted and murdered by corrupt human powers
00:05:42.840 But in reality he was dying for the sins of his enemies
00:05:46.520 And afterward he was vindicated and given resurrection life by the Spirit
00:05:51.200 And now Jesus is exalted as king over all human and spiritual powers
00:05:56.080 Then Peter shows how baptism points to the vindication of Jesus' followers
00:06:01.020 Like Noah they have been saved through the waters not as a magic ritual
00:06:05.226 but as a sacred symbol that shows their change of heart
00:06:08.600 their desire to be joined to Jesus in his death and his resurrection
00:06:12.920 And so now even if they are murdered for following Jesus
00:06:16.000 their hope is in future vindication and exaltation alongside their king
00:06:20.750 which leads Peter into the final movement
00:06:22.800 He recalls Jesus' words that his disciples should consider it an honor and joy to be persecuted just like he was
00:06:28.980 Peter then calls on church leaders to care for these suffering Christians
00:06:32.980 and to show the same kind of servant leadership that Jesus did to his followers
00:06:37.100 And finally Peter reminds these Christians about the real enemy that they are facing
00:06:41.600 This hostility isn't simply cultural or even political
00:06:44.980 There are dark forces of spiritual evil at work inspiring hatred and violence
00:06:50.760 And they are to resist this evil by staying faithful to Jesus and his teachings
00:06:55.740 and by anticipating his return and ultimate victory over such evil
00:06:59.880 Peter concludes with a prayer for divine strength
00:07:02.660 And he sends a greeting from the church in Rome which he calls Babylon
00:07:06.520 Now this is cool
00:07:07.520 Peter's adopting here the tradition of the Old Testament prophets
00:07:10.500 for whom the name Babylon became an archetype for any and every corrupt nation
00:07:16.000 And so Rome has become the new Babylon and its empire is where God's people are now exiled from their true home in the renewed creation
00:07:24.520 Peter's first letter is a powerful reminder of Christian hope in the midst of suffering
00:07:29.300 God's people have been a misunderstood minority from the very beginning
00:07:33.260 And they should expect to face hostility because they have chosen to live under the rule of a different king Jesus
00:07:39.520 However persecution can become a strange gift to the church
00:07:43.000 because it offers a chance to show others the surprising generosity and love of Jesus
00:07:48.360 which is fueled by the hope of his return
00:07:51.060 And that's what first Peter is all about
