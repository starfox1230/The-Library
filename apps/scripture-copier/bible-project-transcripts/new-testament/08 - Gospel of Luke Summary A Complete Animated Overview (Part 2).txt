00:00:03.000 The Gospel according to Luke.
00:00:04.600 In the first video we explored Luke'sportrayal of John the Baptist and Jesus
00:00:08.900 as the fulfillment of the story of Israel
00:00:11.300 and of God's promises toldin the Old Testament Scriptures.
00:00:14.600 We then watched Jesus launches mission
00:00:16.500 and bring the good news of God'sKingdom to the poor among Israel:
00:00:20.000 people of low social statusand also people who are outsiders.
00:00:24.000 And Jesus taught that His Kingdom is upside down
00:00:27.100 it's a reversal of allof our common social values.
00:00:30.200 This section culminated with Lukeshowing us how Jesus was a new Moses
00:00:34.800 about to bring a newExodus by His death in Jerusalem.
00:00:38.600 And so we come to the largecenter section of the book
00:00:41.800 where Jesus leads His newlyformed Israel on a journey to Jerusalem.
00:00:46.000 This part of the book consistsmainly of Jesus' teaching and parables
00:00:49.625 given on the road to thevarious people He encounters,
00:00:52.700 mainly His growing group of disciples.
00:00:55.400 And in this way Luke portraysfollowing Jesus as a journey.
00:00:59.100 It's something you do where youlearn as you go along life's path
00:01:03.200 so first Jesus invites Hisdisciples into His mission
00:01:06.300 as He sends a wave of them to goahead of Him announcing God's Kingdom.
00:01:10.000 So being a disciple right from the start it means:
00:01:12.700 participating in Jesus'Kingdom mission, making it your own.
00:01:16.600 And as Jesus' disciples come backHe then starts to give various teachings
00:01:20.700 about prayer, about trusting in God's provision.
00:01:24.000 It's actually in these chaptersof Luke that Jesus talks more about money,
00:01:27.850 possessions and generositythan anywhere else in His teachings.
00:01:31.400 If following Him is truly like being on the road,
00:01:34.800 it should produce this minimalistmentality creating a freedom from possessions
00:01:39.600 that allows for radical generosity.
00:01:41.800 Another key theme in these chaptersis Jesus continued mission to the poor
00:01:46.600 so as He travels He keeps forming His new Israel
00:01:49.400 and He encounters all thesepeople who are sick or blind.
00:01:52.800 He meets Samaritans who areancient enemies of the Jewish people
00:01:56.400 and famously Zacchaeus as Jewish man butwho heads up tax collection for the Romans.
00:02:01.100 All of these social outsiders meet Jesusand they're transformed by the encounter.
00:02:06.800 And so they join His Kingdom community
00:02:09.199 which Jesus describes as a great banquet party.
00:02:13.000 He is here to seek and save the lost
00:02:15.950 and so he's celebrating whenpeople discover the mercy of God,
00:02:19.400 but not everybody at the party is happy.
00:02:22.200 Luke includes multiple storiesof Jesus at banquets with Israel's leaders
00:02:26.600 and these all become heated debates
00:02:28.800 where Jesus confronts their pride and hypocrisy.
00:02:31.600 And so these contrasting banquetparties they're captured most memorably
00:02:35.600 in Jesus parable of the prodigal son.
00:02:38.000 So father had two sons and one foolishlyran away and squandered His inheritance
00:02:44.000 but he comes back eventually repentant.
00:02:46.400 And his father forgives him and hethrows this huge party to celebrate:
00:02:50.000 my son who was lost but now is found.
00:02:52.600 But the older brother,who never left his father, he's angry
00:02:56.600 and he resents his father'sgenerosity to this undeserving son.
00:03:00.500 In this famous parable Jesus is explainingHis whole Kingdom mission to these leaders.
00:03:06.200 His parties represent God’s joyous welcomeof every kind of person into His family.
00:03:12.200 The only entry requirementis humility and repentance.
00:03:16.400 And so it highlightsthe tragedy of Israel's leaders
00:03:19.200 who reject Jesus and Hisupside-down Kingdom community.
00:03:23.200 And this resistance to Jesus it ramps up.
00:03:25.400 And He finally arrives in Jerusalem for Passover.
00:03:28.400 as He nears the city He's weeping.
00:03:30.600 His disciples are hailingHim as the Messianic King
00:03:33.300 but Israel's leaders are denouncing Him.
00:03:35.900 And He knows that theirrejection of His Kingdom of peace
00:03:39.700 is going to set Israel on a road of resistance
00:03:42.950 and rebellion against the Roman Empire.
00:03:45.200 It will bring the city's downfall.
00:03:47.700 And it's that destructionof Jerusalem that Jesus symbolically enacts
00:03:52.300 as He storms into the templeand He runs out the animal sellers,
00:03:55.900 He brings the sacrificial system to a halt
00:03:58.300 and He says that this place of worship hasbecome a den of rebels and will be destroyed.
00:04:03.600 Now this act of coursegenerates a whole series of debates
00:04:06.700 between Jesus and Israel's leaders
00:04:08.800 all leading up to Jesus' prediction
00:04:10.800 that the Roman armieswill one day surround the city.
00:04:13.800 It will decimate it and thetemple all within a generation.
00:04:18.000 With that Jesus retreat with Hisdisciples to celebrate the Passover meal.
00:04:22.300 It's the annual symbolic mealabout Israel's liberation from slavery
00:04:26.600 through the death of the Lamb.
00:04:27.800 So Jesus turns the meal's bread and wineinto new symbols about this new Exodus:
00:04:34.000 His broken body His shed blood willbring liberation for Jesus's renewed Israel.
00:04:40.100 After the meal Jesus is arrestedand He's examined before the Jewish leaders
00:04:44.400 and then put on trial as one claiming to be king.
00:04:48.000 and Luke emphasizes: Jesus is innocent.
00:04:50.600 Pilate the Roman governor he claims
00:04:52.600 that Jesus is innocentthree times before giving in.
00:04:56.000 Even Herod the ruler of Galileefinds nothing to accuse Jesus of.
00:05:00.200 But the leaders finally compelledPilate to have Him crucified and so He is.
00:05:05.200 But even in His painful death Jesusembodies the love and the mercy of God
00:05:10.200 He taught so much about.
00:05:12.000 He offers God's forgivenessto the soldiers as they crucify Him.
00:05:16.400 And then when one of the criminals executedalongside Jesus realizes who He actually is,
00:05:22.200 he says: “Remember me whenyou come in your Kingdom.”
00:05:25.000 And Jesus' final words arean offer of hope to a humiliated criminal:
00:05:30.100 “Today you will be with me in paradise”
00:05:32.600 And so with this last actof generosity and kindness Jesus dies.
00:05:37.400 His body is placed in a tomb
00:05:38.800 and on the first day of the weeksome of Jesus disciples come to the tomb
00:05:42.800 only to find it empty.
00:05:44.700 And there are two angelic figuresthey're telling them that Jesus is alive
00:05:48.700 that He's risen from the deadand so they leave with their minds blown.
00:05:53.000 and it's right here that Luketells one of his most beautiful stories:
00:05:56.600 two of Jesus' disciples they'releaving Jerusalem for a town called Emmaus
00:06:01.300 and they're heartbroken over Jesus's death.
00:06:04.200 And then suddenly Jesus isthere just walking alongside them
00:06:07.800 but they don't recognize Him.
00:06:09.400 He asked why they're so sad and theygo on to talk about all of their hopes
00:06:13.900 that Jesus would have been the oneto redeem Israel but now He's dead.
00:06:18.400 it was all for nothing.
00:06:20.200 But then later as Jesus has a meal with these two
00:06:23.600 He breaks bread for them justas He did at the Passover meal
00:06:27.400 and it's in that moment that they recognize Him.
00:06:30.300 Then He disappears.
00:06:32.200 Luke is telling the story to makea powerful point about following Jesus.
00:06:36.600 When Jesus' disciples impose theiragenda and their view of reality on Jesus
00:06:42.000 He remains invisible and unknown to them.
00:06:45.000 It's only when we submit ourselvesto the upside down Kingdom of Jesus
00:06:49.600 that epitomized in His broken bodyon the cross offered in self-giving love;
00:06:54.800 it's only then that wesee and know the real Jesus.
00:06:59.200 The book's concluding scene is yet anothermeal as Jesus appears to His disciples
00:07:04.000 and He explains to them fromthe Old Testament Scriptures
00:07:06.700 how this was all a part of God's planthat the Messiah would become Israel's King
00:07:11.700 by suffering and dying for their sins
00:07:13.900 and conquering their evil with His resurrection life.
00:07:16.600 And so now as Simeonthe Prophet promised back in chapter 2:
00:07:20.600 Jesus' Kingdom will move outward from Israel
00:07:24.000 so God's forgiveness can be announced to the nations
00:07:26.900 and everyone invited to follow Jesus.
00:07:29.200 But Jesus tells His disciples wait in Jerusalem
00:07:33.300 for the coming of the Spiritto empower them for this new mission.
00:07:37.200 And this of course keeps you readingright into Luke's second volume,
00:07:40.600 the book of Acts.
00:07:41.500 But for now that's the Gospel according to Luke.
