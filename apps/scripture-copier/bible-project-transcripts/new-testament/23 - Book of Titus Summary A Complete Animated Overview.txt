00:00:03.180 Paul's letter to Titus.
00:00:04.800 Titus was a Greek follower of Jesus who was for years a trusted coworker and travelling companion of Paul.
00:00:11.320 He had helped Paul in a number of crisis situations in the past.
00:00:14.740 In this letter we discover that Paul had assigned him the task of going to Crete,
00:00:19.080 a large island off the coast of Greece to restore order to a network of house churches.
00:00:24.060 Cretan culture was notorious in the ancient world.
00:00:27.220 One of the Greek words for being a liar was "kretizo," "to be a Cretan".
00:00:31.740 These people were infamous for treachery and greed.
00:00:34.880 Most of the men on the island had served as mercenary soldiers to the highest bidder.
00:00:39.540 The island cities were known as being unsafe, plagued by violence and sexual corruption.
00:00:45.480 However, the island of Crete had many strategic harbors.
00:00:48.900 They serviced cities all over the ancient Mediterranean Sea.
00:00:52.460 From Paul's point of view, Crete was the perfect place to start a network of churches.
00:00:57.280 We do not know the details,
00:00:58.840 but somehow these churches came under the influence of corrupt Cretan leaders.
00:01:03.480 They said they were Christians but they were ruining the churches.
00:01:06.580 So Paul assigned Titus with the task of going there to set things straight.
00:01:10.920 This letter provided the instructions.
00:01:13.160 It has a pretty straightforward design.
00:01:14.960 After a brief introduction Paul gives Titus clear instructions about his tasks in the church.
00:01:20.280 He then offers guidance about the new kind of household
00:01:23.460 and then about the new kind of humanity that the gospel could create in these Cretan communities.
00:01:29.000 Paul then closes the letter with some final greetings.
00:01:31.920 Paul opens the whole thing by reminding Titus that his message as an apostle is about the hope of eternal life.
00:01:39.180 That is, the life of the new creation that is available starting now through Jesus the Messiah.
00:01:45.600 This hope was promised long ago by the God who does not lie.
00:01:50.520 This little opening comment introduces an important theme underlying the whole letter.
00:01:55.740 One of the problems in the Cretan churches was that they had assimilated their ideas about Jesus, the Christian God,
00:02:02.280 to their ideas about the Greek gods that they grew up with, specifically Zeus, their chief God.
00:02:08.340 Cretan people claimed that Zeus was actually born on their Island.
00:02:11.860 They loved to tell stories and mythologies about Zeus' underhanded character.
00:02:16.390 He would seduce women and lie to get his way.
00:02:19.135 Paul wants to be really clear: the God revealed through Jesus is totally different than Zeus.
00:02:25.880 His basic character traits are faithfulness and truth,
00:02:29.520 which means the Christian way of life will be about truth also, which will be a real change for these Cretans.
00:02:35.320 Paul then addresses Titus with a two-fold task.
00:02:38.240 He says the first one is to appoint new leaders for each church community, a team of what he calls "elders",
00:02:44.600 mature husbands or fathers whose way of life is totally different from Cretan culture.
00:02:49.520 They are to be known for integrity, total devotion to Jesus, for self-control and generosity, both in their families and in the community at large.
00:02:57.820 These new leaders are to teach the good news about Jesus and replace the corrupt leaders who need to be confronted.
00:03:04.780 That is Titus' second task.
00:03:06.540 Paul identifies the teachers as those of the circumcision.
00:03:09.840 In other words, they were ethnically Jewish Cretans who said that they followed Jesus but,
00:03:15.260 similar to the problems in Galatia, these people demanded that non-Jewish Christians be circumsized
00:03:21.440 and follow the laws of the Torah if they really wanted to become followers of the Jewish Messiah.
00:03:26.240 Paul says that they are obsessed with Jewish myths and human commands.
00:03:30.540 To top it off, they are just in the church leadership business to make money.
00:03:35.150 So Paul, in a brilliant move, pulls a quote from an ancient Cretan poet, Epimenides,
00:03:40.460 who was very frank and honest about the character of his own people.
00:03:43.940 He said Cretans are always liars, vicious beasts, and lazy gluttons.
00:03:48.740 They blur the lines between true and false, between good and evil and they are just in it for the money.
00:03:55.020 So while these leaders claim to know God, their Cretan way of life denies him.
00:03:59.800 They have to be dealt with.
00:04:01.880 This leads Paul into the next section.
00:04:03.840 Because of these corrupt leaders, many Christians in these churches now have homes and personal lives that are a total wreck
00:04:10.620 In three different times, Paul highlights the result of all this: the message about Jesus is discredited.
00:04:15.900 Their non-Christian neighbors now have good cause to make evil accusations.
00:04:20.480 All of this makes the teaching about God our Savior totally unattractive and not compelling to anybody.
00:04:27.340 So Paul paints a picture of the ideal Cretan household that is devoted to Jesus.
00:04:32.120 It would be elderly men and women who are full of integrity and self-control,
00:04:37.340 so they can become models of character to the young people.
00:04:40.480 The young women should not be sleeping around and avoiding marriage, as was fashionable on Crete at the time.
00:04:46.300 Rather, they should be looking for faithful partners so they can raise stable, healthy families.
00:04:51.420 The young men are to do the same.
00:04:53.120 They are to be known as productive, healthy citizens.
00:04:56.640 Christian slaves on Crete were in a unique position.
00:04:59.920 We know that, because of the gospel, they were treated as equals in Paul's church communities.
00:05:04.860 However there was a danger that they would use that equality as license to disrespect their masters
00:05:10.300 and then become associated with slave rebellions,
00:05:12.960 which would further discredit the Christian message.
00:05:15.050 You can see Paul negotiating a fine line here.
00:05:18.100 He believes that the gospel about Jesus needs to prove its redemptive power in the public square
00:05:24.450 if it is really going to transform Cretan culture.
00:05:27.160 That is not going to happen through social upheaval or by Christians cloistering away from urban life.
00:05:33.720 The Christian message will be compelling to Cretans when Christians fully participate in public life,
00:05:39.260 when their lives and homes look similar on the surface
00:05:42.580 because after a closer look, their neighbors will discover that Christians live by a totally different value system
00:05:48.660 out of devotion to a totally different God.
00:05:52.060 That is the difference that Paul beautifully summarizes at the end of chapter 2.
00:05:56.400 He says the value system driving the Christian Way of life
00:05:59.420 is God's generous grace which appeared in the person of Jesus and will appear again at his return.
00:06:05.720 This grace was demonstrated when Jesus gave up his honor to die a shameful death on behalf of his enemies
00:06:12.440 so that he could rescue and redeem them.
00:06:15.360 It is that same grace that calls God's people to say, "No!" to corrupt ways of life
00:06:20.300 that are inconsistent with the generous love of God.
00:06:23.600 Paul then zooms out from the Christian household to a vision of Christians living like new humans in Cretan society.
00:06:30.620 Of all people, Christians should be known as the ideal citizens:
00:06:35.320 peaceable, generous, obedient to authorities, known for pursuing the common good.
00:06:40.860 This is really different from how Cretans grew up.
00:06:43.820 How are Christians supposed to sustain this countercultural way of life?
00:06:47.920 Paul believes the power source is the transforming love of the three and one God announced in the gospel.
00:06:54.240 He explores this with a really beautiful poem.
00:06:57.300 He says God's kindness and love are what saved us, despite ourselves,
00:07:01.840 so that through the Holy Spirit, God washed, rebirthed and renewed people.
00:07:07.800 Through Jesus, He has provided a way for people to be declared right before him.
00:07:13.200 All of his opens up eternal life.
00:07:16.160 That is, a new future in the new creation.
00:07:19.520 This living story is so powerful it can produce new kinds of people.
00:07:23.600 Paul is convinced that Spirit-empowered faithfulness to the teachings of Jesus
00:07:28.100 will declare God's grace all over the island of Crete and all over the world.
00:07:33.120 Paul concludes by promising to send backup for Titus, either Artemas or Tychicus
00:07:38.200 Then he says hello to their common friends.
00:07:40.489 And so the letter ends.
00:07:41.500 The letter of Titus shows us Paul's missionary strategy
00:07:45.120 for churches to become agents of transformation within their communities.
00:07:49.240 It will not happen by waging a culture war or by assimilating to the Cretan way of life.
00:07:55.340 Rather, he calls these Christians to wisely participate in Cretan culture.
00:07:59.920 They need to reject what is corrupt but also embrace what is good there.
00:08:04.400 If they can learn to live peaceably and devote themselves to Jesus and to the common good,
00:08:09.100 Christians will, in his words, "Show the beauty of the message about our saving God."
00:08:14.940 That is what the letter to Titus is all about.
