00:00:03.160 The Book of Psalms. It's a collection of150 ancient Hebrew poems, songs, and
00:00:08.720 prayers that come from all differentperiods in Israel's history. Many of
00:00:12.559 these poems are connected with KingDavid-- 73, actually. And he was known as a
00:00:17.290 poet and a harp player. But there are manydifferent authors behind these poems.
00:00:21.470 There's the poems of Asaph, or from thesons of Korah, and some from other
00:00:25.890 worship leaders in the temple. Even Solomon andMoses have their own poems and nearly
00:00:31.289 one third of these are anonymous.
00:00:33.630 Now many of these poems came to be usedby the choirs that  sang in Israel's
00:00:37.739 temple. But the Book of Psalms is actuallynot a hymn book. At some point in the
00:00:42.820 period after Israel's exile to Babylon,these ancient poems were gathered
00:00:47.280 together and intentionally arranged intothe Book of Psalms before us. And it has
00:00:52.010 a very unique design and message thatyou're not gonna notice unless you read
00:00:56.149 it from beginning to end.  Now to see how theBook of Psalms is designed, it's actually most
00:01:01.109 helpful to start at the end. The bookconcludes with five poems of praise to
00:01:05.810 the God of Israel and each one beginsand ends with the word "hallelujah," which
00:01:10.950 is Hebrew for a command to tell a groupof people to praise "Yah," which is short
00:01:15.950 for the divine name Yahweh. Nowthat's a really nice five-part
00:01:19.060 arrangement and it looks like someone'sgiving us a conclusion here to the book.
00:01:23.550 So it invites the question, "does the bookhave any other signs of intentional
00:01:28.240 design?" If you pay attention to the headingsof the poems, you'll notice that at five
00:01:32.120 places your Bible translators have theheading "book one," "book two,"  "book three," "four,"
00:01:37.200 and "five" at various points and thatthese divide the book into five large
00:01:42.070 sections. Now the reason for this is thatthe final poem in each of those sections
00:01:47.440 have a very similar ending that lookslike an editorial addition. It reads
00:01:52.840 something like, "May the LORD, the God ofIsrael, be blessed forever and ever, amen
00:01:57.040 and amen." So the book has a conclusion,it has an internal organization into
00:02:02.890 five main parts and so the natural placeto go from here is now the beginning-- to
00:02:07.080 look for an introduction. And what do wefind? Psalm 1 and 2,
00:02:11.690 which stand outside of Book One becausemost of the poems in Book One are linked
00:02:16.940 to David except Psalms 1 and 2, whichare anonymous.
00:02:20.320 Psalm 1 celebrates how blessed theperson is who meditates on the Torah,
00:02:25.740 prayerfully reading it day and night andthen obeying it.  Now the word "Torah," it simply
00:02:31.550 means "teaching" and more specifically itcame to refer to the five books of Moses
00:02:36.160 that begin the Old Testament. And hereactually, the word seems to be used with
00:02:40.230 both meanings in mind, which explains why ithas five main parts. The Book of Psalms
00:02:45.300 is being offered as a new Torah thatwill teach God's people the lifelong
00:02:50.870 practice of prayer as they strive toobey God's commands given in the first
00:02:55.950 Torah.  Psalm 2 is a poetic reflection onGod's promise to King David from 2nd
00:03:00.500 Samuel chapter 7 that one day aMessianic King would come and establish
00:03:04.350 God's kingdom over the world, defeat eviland rebellion among the nations. Now Psalm 2
00:03:08.950 concludes by saying that all of thosewho take refuge in the Messianic King
00:03:13.410 will be blessed, precisely the word usedto open Psalm 1. And so together these
00:03:19.230 two poems tell us that the Book ofPsalms is designed to be the prayer book
00:03:23.040 of God's people as they strive to befaithful to the commands of the Torah as
00:03:28.090 they hope and wait for the futureMessianic Kingdom. Now with these two
00:03:31.660 themes introduced, we can start to seehow the smaller books have been designed
00:03:36.050 as well around these two ideas. So forexample, Book One has, right at the center,
00:03:40.670 a collection of poems, Psalms 15 through 24,that opens and closes with a call to
00:03:46.730 covenant faithfulness. And then, in Psalms 16 to18, we find a depiction
00:03:51.200 of David as a model of this kind offaithfulness. So he calls out to God to
00:03:55.750 deliver him and God elevates him as King.Now in the corresponding set of poems
00:04:00.489 Psalms 20-23, the David of the past hasbecome an image of the Messianic King of
00:04:06.739 the future, who will also call out to God,he will be delivered, and then given a
00:04:11.600 kingdom over the nations. And then rightat the center of this collection is a poem,
00:04:15.269 Psalm 19, dedicated to praising God forthe Torah.  So here we go:  the two themes
00:04:20.410 from Psalm 1 and 2 are bound together
00:04:22.970 tightly here. Book Two opens with two poems thatare united in their hope for a future
00:04:28.590 return to the temple in Zion and thisis the image closely associated with the
00:04:32.680 hope of the Messianic Kingdom. ThenBook Two closes with a poem that
00:04:36.610 depicts the future reign of theMessianic King over all of the nations.
00:04:40.410 This poem's really amazing because itechoes all these other passages from
00:04:44.640 the prophets about the Messianic Kingdomand it concludes by saying that this
00:04:48.980 king's reign will bring about the fulfillmentof God's ancient promise to Abraham to
00:04:54.320 bring God's blessing to all of thenation's. Book Three also concludes with a
00:04:58.960 poem reflecting on God's promise toDavid, but this time in light of Israel's
00:05:03.150 exile. So the poet remembers how God saidhe would never abandon the line of David
00:05:07.960 but now he's looking at Israel'srebellion in its result and destruction
00:05:12.330 and exile and the downfall of the line ofDavid. And so the poet ends by asking God
00:05:17.440 to never forget his promise to David.Book Four is designed to respond to this
00:05:22.080 crisis of exile. So the opening poemreturns us back to Israel's roots with a
00:05:27.280 prayer of Moses and he does what he didon Mount Sinai after the Golden Calf
00:05:31.610 incident, which is to call upon God toshow mercy. The center of Book Four is
00:05:35.980 dominated by a group of poems thatannounced that the LORD, the God of
00:05:39.840 Israel, reigns as the true king of theworld and all creation-- trees, mountains,
00:05:45.169 rivers-- are all summoned to celebratethat future day when God will bring his
00:05:49.700 justice and kingdom over all the world.Book Five opens with a series of poems
00:05:54.930 that affirmed that God hears the cries ofhis people and will one day send the
00:05:59.120 future king to defeat evil and bringGod's kingdom.This book also contains
00:06:03.650 two larger collections, one called the"hallel", the other called "the songs of
00:06:08.210 ascent." Each one of these collectionsconcludes with a poem about the future
00:06:12.550 Messianic Kingdom. And these twocollections together, they sustain the
00:06:16.550 hope for a future exodus-like act of Godto redeem his people. And then, right
00:06:22.310 between them is Psalm 119. It's the longestpoem in the book. It's an alphabet poem, each
00:06:28.310 line begins with a new letter of theHebrew alphabet, and it explores the
00:06:31.979 wonder and the
00:06:32.840 gift of the Torah as God's Word to hispeople. So here we go.
00:06:36.620 The themes from Psalm 1 and Psalm 2 and Torah andMessiah combined all together here in
00:06:41.300 Book Five. Which brings us all the wayback to that five-poem conclusion. In
00:06:45.900 the center poem, Psalm 148, all creation issummoned to praise the God of Israel
00:06:50.350 because he has "raised up a hornfor his people." Now the horn here, is a
00:06:55.760 metaphor of a bull's horn raised invictory. And this image
00:06:59.850 echoes back to the same image used inHannah's song, 1Samuel chapter 2, but
00:07:04.680 also to the earlier Psalm 132. The horn is a symbol for the
00:07:09.410 future Messianic King and his victoryover evil. It's a fitting conclusion to this
00:07:13.950 amazing book. Now here's one more thingthat you are likely going to miss if you
00:07:18.790 don't read this book in order.
00:07:20.880 There's lots of different kinds of poemsin the book of Psalms but they all
00:07:24.340 basically fall into two big categories--either poems of lament or poems of
00:07:28.669 praise. Poems of lament expressed pain,confusion, and anger about how horrible
00:07:34.760 the world is and how horrible things arehappening to the poet and so these poems
00:07:39.260 draw attention to what's wrong in theworld and they ask God to do something
00:07:42.710 about it. There's a lot of these in thebook, which tells us something important--
00:07:47.590 that lament is an appropriate response tothe evil that we see in our world. But
00:07:53.280 what you'll notice is that lament poemspredominate earlier in the book, in books
00:07:57.780 1 through 3. Pay attention because you'll seepraise poems occasionally too. Praise
00:08:03.070 poems are poems of joy and celebrationand they draw attention to what's good
00:08:07.389 in the world. They retell stories of whatGod has done in our lives and thank God
00:08:11.870 for it. In Books Four and Five you'llnotice that praise poems come to
00:08:16.349 outnumber lament poems and it all culminatesin that five-part hallelujah conclusion.
00:08:21.740 So this shift from lament to praise, thisis profound, and it tells us something
00:08:26.639 about the nature of prayer. As we hopedfor the Messianic Kingdom, as the book
00:08:30.610 teaches us to do, this will createtension for us as we look out on the
00:08:35.000 tragic state of our world and of ourlives. And so the psalms teach us not to
00:08:39.370 ignore the pain of our lives but at thesame time,
00:08:42.799 Biblical faith is forward-looking--looking to the promise of God's future
00:08:48.190 Messianic Kingdom. And so Torah andMessiah, lament and praise, faith and
00:08:54.709 hope. That's what the Book of Psalms isall about.
