# https://www.youtube.com/watch/OPMaRqGJPUU

00:00:03.780 The book of the prophet Habakkuk
00:00:05.940 He lived during the final decades of Israel's southern kingdom and it was a time of injustice and idolatory
00:00:12.440 He saw the rising threat of Babylon on the horizon and that was not good news for anybody
00:00:18.720 But unlike the other prophets, Habakkuk does not accuse Israel, he doesn't even speak on God's behalf to the people
00:00:24.860 Rather all of his words are addressed personally to God, and the book tells about Habakkuk's personal struggle,
00:00:31.620 his journey of trying to believe that God is good when there is so much evil and tragedy in the world
00:00:38.020 And so Habakkuk's words are actually poems of lament and they are very similar to the laments you find in the book of Psalms
00:00:44.060 The poet lodges a complaint and then draws God's attention to suffering or injustice in the world, demanding that God do something
00:00:51.700 and knowing about this lament form is actually the key to understanding the design and message of this short book
00:00:58.100 Chapters 1 and 2 are framed as a back and forth argument between Habakkuk and God
00:01:03.520 and the prophet lodges 2 complaints to which God offers 2 responses
00:01:08.260 His first complaint is that life in Israel has become horrible
00:01:12.240 The torah is neglected, resulting in violence and injustice, and it's all being tolerated by Israel's corrupt leaders
00:01:19.500 And Habakkuk he's crying out asking God to do something but nothing seems to change
00:01:24.780 But then all of a sudden God responds, He says that He's very aware of the corruption of His own people Israel
00:01:31.720 and that He's summoning the armies of Babylon to bring down His justice on Israel
00:01:36.620 and very similar to the message of Micah or Isaiah, God says he will use this terrifying empire to devour Israel because of their injustice and evil
00:01:45.940 But Habakkuk has a problem with this answer and so he offers his second complaint
00:01:50.720 He says Babylon is even worse than Israel, they are more corrupt, they are more violent
00:01:56.060 they've deified their own military power, they treat humans like animals, gathering them up like fish in a net he says,
00:02:03.120 they devour nations and people groups in order to build their own empire
00:02:07.860 And so Habakkuk says, how can you, a holy good God use such corrupt nations as your instruments in history?
00:02:16.220 He demands an explanation. In fact, he depicts himself as a watchman on the city walls, waiting for God's response, which eventually comes.
00:02:24.280 God tells Habakkuk to get out some tablets, chisel and write down what he sees and hears.
00:02:30.140 It's a vision about an appointed time in the future, that even though it may seem slow in coming, it will eventually come
00:02:37.440 In fact God says that the righteous person will live by their faith in this hope and vision
00:02:43.220 So what is this divine promise that Habakkuk is supposed to write down?
00:02:47.480 It's that God will bring Babylon down
00:02:50.060 God says that the violence and oppression of the nations creates this never ending cycle of revenge
00:02:56.540 And that God will use this cycle to bring about the rise and fall of nations
00:03:01.180 The fact that God might for a time use a corrupt nation like Babylon does not mean that He endorses everything that they do
00:03:08.900 He holds all nations accountable to His justice and so Babylon will fall along with any other nation that acts like them.
00:03:15.880 God's promise is then elaborated by a series of 5 woes
00:03:19.780 that describe the kinds of oppression and injustice that is perpetrated by nations like Babylon
00:03:25.780 The first 2 target unjust economic practices, like how wealthy people would charge ridiculous interest just to keep poor people in debt
00:03:33.220 And so they build their wealth through crooked means
00:03:36.440 The third woe is a critique of slave labour, treating humans like animals and threatening them with violence if they don't produce.
00:03:43.840 The fourth woe targets the abuse of alcohol by irresponsible leaders.
00:03:48.460 While people are suffering under their bad leadership, they're partying and wasting their money on sex and booze.
00:03:54.480 And the last woe exposes the idolatry, the engine that drives such nations
00:03:59.200 They have made money and power and national security into their gods, offering these allegiance at all costs
00:04:06.180 And so people become slaves to their own national empire.
00:04:10.840 Now the practices described here aren't unique to Babylon, but that's part of the point.
00:04:15.620 Given the human condition, most nations eventually become Babylon
00:04:21.060 And so this is how God's answer to Habakkuk in this book becomes God's answer to all later generations
00:04:27.820 to anyone who lives in a world ruled by other Babylons
00:04:31.720 But it leaves the question hanging -
00:04:33.220 is God going to let this cycle, the rise and fall of Babylon-like empires go on forever?
00:04:38.640 And that question is what chapter 3 is about.
00:04:40.860 We're told that this is a prayer of Habakkuk
00:04:43.500 and it begins by Habakkuk pleading with God to act now in the present, like He has in the past in bringing down corrupt nations
00:04:52.520 And what follows is a very ancient poem
00:04:55.080 It first describes a powerful terrifying appearance of God
00:04:59.300 It's very similar to the opening poems of Micah and Nahum
00:05:02.660 And similar to the appearance of God at Mount Sinai in the book of Exodus
00:05:06.440 There's cloud and fire and earthquake
00:05:09.140 When the Creator shows up to confront human evil, everybody will be paying attention.
00:05:14.580 Habakkuk then goes on to describe this future defeat of evil as a future exodus.
00:05:20.120 So just like God came as a warrior and He split the sea in His battle against Pharaoh,
00:05:25.280 Habakkuk says that God will once more bring His judgment down on the head of the evil house.
00:05:30.920 So Pharaoh, like Babylon, has become here an archetype of violent human nations.
00:05:36.460 But at the same time we're told that when God confronts evil, He will save His people and His anointed one.
00:05:43.480 It's a reference to the king from the line of David
00:05:46.740 And so in this poem, the exodus story of the past has become an image of the future exodus God will perform
00:05:54.400 He will once again defeat evil and bring down the Pharaohs and the Babylons of this world
00:05:59.740 He'll bring justice to all people and rescue the oppressed and the innocent
00:06:04.460 And it's this hope that enables Habakkuk to conclude the book with hopeful praise
00:06:09.280 that even if the world's falling apart with food shortage or drought or war or whatever
00:06:14.400 he will choose trust and joy in the covenant promises of God.
00:06:18.960 And so Habakkuk by the end of this book becomes a shining example of how the righteous live by faith
00:06:26.420 Habakkuk recognises just how dark and chaotic the world and our lives can become
00:06:31.440 and he invites us into a journey of faith, of trusting that God loves this world more than we do and that He will one day deal with its evil
00:06:42.500 and that's what the book of Habakkuk is all about.
