00:00:03.070 The book of Esther. It's one of the moreexciting and curious books in the Bible.
00:00:07.779 The story is set over 100 years after the Babylonianexile of the Israelites from their land.
00:00:13.300 And while some Jews did return to Jerusalem,remember Ezra and Nehemiah, many did not.
00:00:19.060 And so the book of Esther is about aJewish community living in Susa,
00:00:22.500 the capital city of the ancient Persian Empire.
00:00:25.800 The main characters in the story are two Jews,
00:00:28.300 Mordecai and then his niece Esther.
00:00:30.800 And then there's the king of Persia who's something of a drunken pushover in this story.
00:00:35.400 And then there's the Persian official Haman, the cunning villain.
00:00:39.220 Now this is a curious book in the Bible mainly for the fact that God is never even mentioned, not once,
00:00:45.700 which might strike you as kind of odd.I mean isn't the Bible about God.
00:00:49.030 But this is a brilliant technique by theauthor, who's anonymous by the way.
00:00:53.400 It's an invitation to readthis story looking for God's activity,
00:00:58.030 and there are signs of it everywhere.
00:01:00.460 The story is full of very odd quote"coincidences" and ironic reversals,
00:01:05.770 and it all forces you to see God's purpose atwork but behind the scenes.
00:01:10.390 Let's just dive into the story.
00:01:12.000 The book opens with the king of Persia throwing two elaborate banquet feasts that last a total of 187 days.
00:01:19.200 And it's all for the grandiose purpose of displaying hisgreatness and splendor.
00:01:23.500 On the last day of the banquet feast, he's really drunk
00:01:26.700 and he demands that his wife Queen Vashti appear at the party to show off her beauty.
00:01:31.700 She refuses and so in a drunken ragethe King deposes Vashti
00:01:36.300 and makes the silly decree that all Persian men should now be the masters of their own homes.
00:01:42.040 Then he holds a beauty pageant because he wants toto find a new queen. This is like a really bad soap opera.
00:01:47.100 But it's right here that we're introduced to Esther and Mordecai.
00:01:50.500 Esther hides her Jewish identityand enters the beauty pageant - and wins!
00:01:55.100 And the king is so obsessed with Esther thathe elevates her to become the new queen of Persia.
00:02:00.800 Now after this, and even more serendipitous,
00:02:03.500 is the fact that Mordecai just happens to overheartwo Royal Guards plotting to murder the king.
00:02:09.900 And so he informs Esther, who in turn informs the kingand Mordecai gets credit for saving the king's life.
00:02:16.700 Now right here, from the beginning,God's not mentioned anywhere,
00:02:20.100 but this all seems providentially ordered.
00:02:22.800 What is it that God's up to? You have to keep reading.
00:02:25.989 We're next introduced to Haman who'snot actually a Persian, he's called an Agagite.
00:02:30.900 He's a descendant of the ancientCanaanites (remember 1st Samuel chapter 15).
00:02:36.100 The king elevates Haman to thehighest position in the kingdom
00:02:39.300 and he demands that everybody kneel before Haman.
00:02:42.730 Well when Mordecai sees Haman, herefuses to kneel,
00:02:46.360 which of course fills Haman with rage,and when he finds out that Mordecai's
00:02:48.600 And when he finds out that Mordecai's Jewish,Haman successfully persuades the king
00:02:53.500 to enact this crazy decree todestroy all of the Jewish people.
00:02:58.400 And to decide the date of the Jews' annihilation,Haman rolls the dice.
00:03:03.400 A die is called "Pur" in Hebrew. Tuck that away for later.
00:03:06.519 Eleven months later, on the thirteenth of Adar,all the Jews will die.
00:03:11.620 Haman and the king then have a drinkingbanquet to celebrate their really horrible decision.
00:03:17.260 So the focus now turns to Mordecai and Estherwho are the only hope for the Jewish people.
00:03:22.700 They make a plan that Esther's goingto reveal her Jewish identity to the king
00:03:27.000 and ask him to reverse the decree.
00:03:29.400 But approaching the king without a royal request is,according to Persian law, an act worthy of death.
00:03:37.239 So in a key statement, Mordecai, he'sconfident that even if Esther remains silent
00:03:42.000 that deliverance for the Jewswill arrive from another place.
00:03:45.800 And then Mordecai wonders aloud, he says "who knows"maybe you become queen for this very moment".
00:03:52.750 Esther responds with bravery and shepurposes to go to the king with her amazing words
00:03:57.900 "If I perish, I perish."
00:04:00.250 Then in what unfolds we watch the ironicreversal of all of Haman's evil plans.
00:04:06.200 So Esther hosts the king and Haman at a first banquet
00:04:09.300 and she says she wants to makea special request of both of them
00:04:13.000 at an exclusive banquet the following day.
00:04:15.730 So Haman leaves the banquet totallydrunk and he sees Mordecai in the street.
00:04:20.470 He fumes with anger.
00:04:22.300 And he orders that a tall stake be built so that  Mordecai can be impaled upon it in the morning.
00:04:28.419 It seems like things can't get any worsefor the Jews and for Mordecai.
00:04:32.530 But all of a sudden the story pivots.
00:04:35.000 It just so happens that night the king,he can't sleep.
00:04:39.300 And he has the royal chroniclesread to him for good bedtime reading.
00:04:42.800 And he just happens to hearabout how Mordecai had saved the king's life.
00:04:47.300 He had totally forgotten.
00:04:48.759 So in the morning, Haman enters torequest Mordecai's execution
00:04:53.220 and the king in that moment orders Haman tohonor Mordecai publicly for saving his life.
00:04:59.470 So now Haman has to lead Mordecai around the cityon a royal horse telling everyone to praise him.
00:05:04.720 Now this moment in the story, it's apivot for the whole book.
00:05:09.490 It's Haman's downfalland Mordecai's rise to power.
00:05:12.600 Watch how this works.
00:05:13.960 The day after is Esther's 2nd banquet.
00:05:16.600 So the king and Haman arrive.
00:05:18.300 And Esther informs the king thatfirst of all she's Jewish
00:05:21.460 And second that Haman has enacted a decreeto murder her,
00:05:25.300 and to murder Mordecai, who saved his life,and to murder all of the Jews.
00:05:29.620 Now the king's had a lot to drink, so when he hears this news he goes into yet one more drunken rage.
00:05:35.800 And he orders that Haman be impaledon the very stake he made for Mordecai.
00:05:40.800 It's ironic and agrizzly way for Haman to go.
00:05:43.990 Haman's execution however, doesn't solvethe problem of the decree to kill all of the Jews.
00:05:49.120 So the focus now turns to Esther andMordecai as they make a plan to reverse the decree.
00:05:54.000 They discover that the King can'trevoke a decree that he's already made.
00:05:58.180 So instead the king commissionsMordecai to issue a counter decree.
00:06:01.700 On the appointed day that all of the Jewswere supposed to be killed, the 13th of Adar,
00:06:06.550 now the Jews are ordered to defend themselvesand to destroy any who plotted to kill them.
00:06:12.200 Then Mordecai, Esther, and Jews everywherehold banquets and feasts to celebrate this new decree.
00:06:17.529 And Mordecai is elevated to a seat beside the king.
00:06:20.829 Eventually the decree day comes. And the Jews triumph over their enemies.
00:06:26.169 First, they destroy Haman's family and then anyother Persian officials who had joined in Haman's plot.
00:06:31.700 And then on a second day, they get permissionto destroy any who plotted against them
00:06:36.400 throughout the entire kingdom.
00:06:37.929 This results in joy and celebration asthe Jews are rescued from annihilation.
00:06:42.099 The story then tells about how Esther and Mordecai established by decree
00:06:46.419 this annual two-day feast of Purimto commemorate their deliverance from destruction.
00:06:51.800 And the name of the feast comes fromHaman's dice, remember "pur-im".
00:06:56.100 The book concludes with a short epilogue as Mordecaiis elevated to second in command in the kingdom.
00:07:01.900 And we are told now with his royal greatness and splendor, as the Jews thrive in exile.
00:07:07.500 Now step back.
00:07:08.859 Notice how this whole story has been designed.
00:07:11.400 The story was full of moments of ironic reversal.
00:07:14.400 But we can now see the whole story isstructured as ironic reversal.
00:07:19.000 Right down to the details.
00:07:20.619 So the King's splendor and feasts and decrees
00:07:23.100 are mirrored by Mordecai's splendorand feasts and decrees at the end.
00:07:26.919 Esther and Mordecai, they first save the king
00:07:29.600 but now in the end they save all of the Jews.
00:07:32.409 Then you have Haman's elevation andedicts and banquet
00:07:35.700 that gets reversed by Mordecai's elevationand edict and banquet.
00:07:40.200 And then at the center, you have Esther and Mordecai'splanning scenes and then Esther's two banquets
00:07:45.600 that act as a frame aroundthe greatest moment of reversal in the whole story:
00:07:50.319 Haman's humiliation and Mordecai's exaltation.Beautiful.
00:07:55.000 Another fascinating feature of this book,is the moral ambiguity of the characters.
00:07:58.700 There's a lot of drinking and anger and sex andmurder, of which Mordecai and Esther are a part.
00:08:04.569 Not to mention their violation of many commands in theTorah, like marrying Gentiles or eating impure foods.
00:08:10.800 And so the story's not putting Mordecai and Esther forward as moral example,
00:08:16.300 as if it endorses all of their behavior.
00:08:18.400 But they are put forward as models oftrust and hope when things get really bad.
00:08:22.700 And so the book of Esther comes back to thatquestion with which we begin:
00:08:26.420 Why God is not mentioned?
00:08:28.800 The message of this books seems to be that
00:08:30.800 when God seems absent, when His people are in exile,when they're unfaithful to the Torah
00:08:36.000 does this mean that God is done with Israel?Has God abandoned His promises?
00:08:40.200 And the book of Esther says, no.
00:08:42.440 It invites us to see that God can and does workin the real mess and moral ambiguity of human history.
00:08:50.200 and He uses the faithfulness of even morallycompromised people to accomplish His purposes.
00:08:56.200 And so the book of Esther asks us to be willing
00:08:58.700 to trust God's providence even whenwe can't see it working.
00:09:02.400 And to hope that no matter how bad things get,God is committed to redeeming His world.
00:09:08.500 And that's what the book of Esther is all about.
