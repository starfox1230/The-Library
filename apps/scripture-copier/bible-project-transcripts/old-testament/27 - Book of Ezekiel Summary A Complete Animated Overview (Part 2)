00:00:02.950 The book of the prophet Ezekiel.
00:00:04.830 In the first video,
00:00:05.670 we were introduced to Ezekiel the priest.
00:00:07.780 And he's sitting among the Exiles in Babylon.
00:00:10.340 And he's confronted by the awesome glory of God's temple presence.
00:00:14.280 But it's appearing to him in Babylon.
00:00:16.680 And then Ezekiel discovers why.
00:00:18.800 It's because of Israel's idolatry and injustice
00:00:21.820 that has compelled God to abandon His own temple.
00:00:25.100 And while there is still hope for the future,
00:00:27.600 the book went on to develop Ezekiel'smessage of divine judgment.
00:00:31.100 First for Israel and then for the nations around Israel.
00:00:34.280 And then a key moment happened in chapter 33.
00:00:36.900 Ezekiel receives a report
00:00:38.780 that the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem is over
00:00:41.260 because the city has fallen,
00:00:43.720 the temple is destroyed.
00:00:45.180 Ezekiel's grimwords of warning came true.
00:00:49.030 The exile was the most horrendouscatastrophe that ever happened to Israel.
00:00:52.720 And it raised the big questions ofwhether God was done with Israel for good.
00:00:57.399 But remember at the end of chapter 11,
00:00:59.599 God promised that there was still a future beyond exile for Israel.
00:01:03.680 And so the rest of the book is designed to explore Ezekiel's vision of hope.
00:01:08.020 First for Israel.
00:01:09.080 Then for the nations.
00:01:10.560 And then for all of creation.
00:01:12.900 The hope for Israel begins with God
00:01:15.060 promising to raise up a new David--
00:01:17.800 a future Messianic King
00:01:19.720 who's going to be the kind of leader
00:01:21.460 that Israel needed but never got.
00:01:23.530 And this new Israel who is going to comeunder the Messianic King's rule
00:01:28.090 is going to be a transformed people.
00:01:30.490 God's going to deal with the heart of their problem of rebellion
00:01:33.840 by giving them new hearts.
00:01:35.580 It's just like Moses promised at the endof the book of Deuteronomy.
00:01:38.640 God says He's going to remove their hard hearts
00:01:41.240 and send His Spirit into His people
00:01:43.840 to give them new soft hearts
00:01:46.040 that can love and obey their God.
00:01:48.040 And this idea gets developed in the next strange vision.
00:01:50.840 Ezekiel sees a huge valley
00:01:52.960 filled up with dry human bones and skeletons.
00:01:56.580 And God tells him that it's an image,
00:01:58.440 a metaphor for Israel's spiritual state.
00:02:01.240 So their rebellion against God
00:02:02.920 that resulted in exile and the literal death of many people.
00:02:06.480 But it was also a metaphorical death of their covenant relationship.
00:02:10.240 And God tells Ezekiel that His Spirit
00:02:12.300 is coming to bring His people back to life.
00:02:15.040 And so this wind comes and itcauses all of the bones to stand up
00:02:19.080 and it fills them with breath and life.
00:02:21.240 And then skin grows over the bones.
00:02:23.240 And then all of a sudden Ezekiel sees all of these new humans
00:02:26.620 standing in front of him.
00:02:28.080 Now this vision, it's recalling the story about the creation of humans in Genesis chapter two
00:02:33.060 where God made humans out of dirt and divine breath.
00:02:36.740 And so Israel and all humanity have rebelled resulting in death.
00:02:40.600 And so the only hope is that God wouldperform a new act of creation and remake humans
00:02:46.660 in such a way that they can truly live
00:02:49.340 in a relationship of love with God and with each other.
00:02:52.720 And so after God is going to deal with the evil
00:02:55.660 that's in the hearts of his own people,
00:02:57.380 some questions still remain unresolved.
00:02:59.460 Like what about the evil that is still rampant out there among the nations?
00:03:03.080 And what about the future of God'sdwelling place in the temple?
00:03:06.300 And this is what the final two sections of the book are about.
00:03:09.220 So first come chapters 38 and 39.
00:03:11.640 And they promised God's final defeat of evil among the nations
00:03:15.920 which gets personified by a ruler
00:03:18.060 who's named GOG from the land of Magog.
00:03:21.099 Now this name is derived from agenealogy of ancient kingdoms and lands
00:03:25.569 from Genesis chapter 10.
00:03:27.109 And it referred to powerful nations from the distant past.
00:03:30.080 And so Ezekiel picks up thisancient biblical name
00:03:33.040 as an image of any and all violent kingdoms.
00:03:36.320 And so we find that Gog gets allied with seven nations
00:03:40.311 that come from all four directions ofthe compass.
00:03:42.940 It's clearly an image that represents all of the nations.
00:03:46.140 This also helps us understand whyEzekiel describes Gog
00:03:49.660 with images that he used earlier in the book
00:03:52.340 to describe the king of Tyre and the king of Egypt, Pharaoh.
00:03:55.980 For Ezekiel Gog is an amalgam ofall of the worst most violent people in the Bible.
00:04:01.880 Gog is the archetype of humanrebellion against God.
00:04:05.590 The basic story in these chapters is that
00:04:07.530 Gog resists God's plan to restore His people.
00:04:10.560 And so just like Pharaoh in the Exodus story,
00:04:12.940 Gog comes to destroy the people.
00:04:15.140 But God unleashes His justice on Gog.
00:04:17.760 And it's in a flurry of scenes that don't actually make very good literal sense if you read them in sequence.
00:04:23.040 Because first Gog and hisarmies are consumed by an earthquake.
00:04:26.080 But then they're consumed by fire, two different times.
00:04:28.760 And then after that
00:04:29.940 God comes and strikes Gog and his army down in the fields
00:04:33.040 where they lay unburied for months.
00:04:35.160 It's clear that these scenes are full of symbol and imagery.
00:04:38.920 Ezekiel has pulled out his entire poetic"tool set" here
00:04:42.240 to describe how God is determined
00:04:44.460 to finally defeat human evil that has ruined his world.
00:04:48.260 And it's so that he can pave the way for a new creation.
00:04:51.800 And so once evil is finally dealt with among the nations,
00:04:54.960 the last section of the book describes how God's presence
00:04:58.260 is going to one day return to His people and His temple to bring cosmic restoration.
00:05:03.620 So Ezekiel first gets this long elaborate vision
00:05:07.180 of a new temple and a new city.
00:05:09.280 He's given this heavenly tour guide whoshows them around the new temple complex
00:05:13.449 and it's much larger and more majesticthan even Solomon's Temple.
00:05:17.460 There's a new altar, new priests,
00:05:19.440 a whole new system of worship.
00:05:21.000 And then after this elaborate tour,
00:05:22.900 God's glorious throne chariot that he saw back in his first vision
00:05:26.720 comes back and it enters the new temple.
00:05:29.740 Now the meaning of these temple visions
00:05:31.340 has been a source of debate for a long, long time.
00:05:34.360 So some Christian and Jewish readers believe
00:05:36.900 that this vision will be fulfilled literally one day.
00:05:39.800 And that these chapters offer the actual blueprints
00:05:42.600 of the new temple that will be built
00:05:44.280 when the Messiah returns and brings God's kingdom.
00:05:47.360 But many other Jewish and Christian readers think that this vision,
00:05:50.560 like all of Ezekiel's other visions, is full of symbols.
00:05:54.430 They depict the reality of God's presencereturning to His people in the Messianic Kingdom
00:05:59.300 but not necessarily in the form of an actual building.
00:06:02.589 Whichever view you take, it's importantthat Ezekiel never calls the city, "Jerusalem."
00:06:07.000 And chapters 47 and 48 show why.
00:06:10.060 Ezekiel sees this tiny stream pouringout of the temple threshold and steps.
00:06:14.979 And then it quickly becomes this raging river.
00:06:17.620 And then it flows out of the temple and the city into the desert
00:06:21.440 into one of the most desolate places on planet earth, the Dead Sea valley.
00:06:25.280 And then that river it leaves behind a trail of trees and life.
00:06:29.140 And then the Dead Sea gets transformed into a living sea
00:06:32.620 that's teeming with plants and animals.
00:06:35.280 All of this imagery comes fromthe Garden of Eden in Genesis chapters one and two.
00:06:39.660 And we see just how cosmicEzekiel's vision really is.
00:06:43.320 God's plan has always been to restore all humanity
00:06:46.740 and all creation back to His life-giving presence.
00:06:49.400 And so the book ends with thename of this garden city --
00:06:52.640 "the Lord is there."
00:06:54.700 And so Ezekiel's visions come to a close
00:06:56.860 full of hope for a new future.
00:06:59.780 New humans living in a new world
00:07:01.920 that's animated by God's life-giving Spirit.
00:07:04.920 It's a world permeated with God's love and justice.
00:07:08.830 And that's what the book of Ezekiel is all about.
