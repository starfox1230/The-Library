# https://www.youtube.com/watch/QJOju5Dw0V0

00:00:03.030 The book the first and second Samuel.
00:00:05.130 They're two separate books in our modern Bibles but that division is due simply to scroll length
00:00:10.230 It was originally written as one coherent story
00:00:13.150 We're just going to cover the book of first Samuel in this video
00:00:15.490 So after Israel was rescued from slavery in Egypt they made a covenant with God at Mount Sinai
00:00:20.800 and eventually came into the promised land
00:00:23.260 and there, Israel was supposed to be faithful to God and obey the covenant commands
00:00:27.780 Before the book of Samuel judges showed how Israel failed at that task big time
00:00:33.840 It was a period of moral chaos and it showed israel's need for wise faithful leaders
00:00:40.120 The book of Samuel provides an answer to that need
00:00:42.920 The book of Samuel's story focuses on three main characters
00:00:46.420 The prophet Samuel where the book gets its name and then King Saul and after that King David
00:00:52.000 In all three of them transition Israel from a group of tribes ruled by judges
00:00:56.440 into a unified kingdom ruled by King David in Jerusalem
00:01:00.720 and the book of Samuel has a fascinating design
00:01:03.320 that weaves the story of these three characters together in four main parts
00:01:07.620 Samuel he's the key leader and prophet in the first section of the book
00:01:11.860 but then he also plays a key role in the next section which is Saul's story and its told in two movements
00:01:17.720 Saul rises to power and then his failures. In the second part is about his downfall in his tragic death
00:01:24.340 In the drama of Saul's demise is matched by David's exciting rise to power
00:01:29.700 and then David's story is told in two movements
00:01:32.560 First he rides the wave of his success followed by his own tragic failure
00:01:37.060 and the slow self destruction of his family and then his kingdom
00:01:40.560 The book concludes with an epilogue that reflects back over the whole story
00:01:44.640 So let's dive in and see how this all unfolds
00:01:47.280 Part 1 picks up from the chaos of the book of Judges
00:01:50.600 and we're introduced to a touching storyabout a woman named Hannah
00:01:55.080 and she's grieved because she has never been able to have children
00:01:58.840 and by God's grace she finally has a son named Samuel
00:02:03.480 And in joy she sings this amazing poem in chapter two
00:02:07.440 And the poem is all about how God opposes the proud and exalts the humble
00:02:12.280 about how despite tragedies and human evil God isworking out his purposes in history
00:02:18.520 and also it's about how God will one day raised up an anointed king for his people
00:02:23.820 and Hannah's poem has been placed here at the beginning of the book to introduce these key themes
00:02:28.680 that were gonna see throughout the whole story like the next one
00:02:32.240 Samuel grows up and becomes a great prophet and leader for the people of Israel
00:02:37.060 at the same time that the Philistines rise to power as Israel's arch nemesis
00:02:42.400 And in this crucial battle the Israelites get arrogant
00:02:46.140 and instead of praying and asking God forhelp they trot out the Ark of the Covenant
00:02:51.240 as this kind of magic trophy that will automatically grant them victory in battle
00:02:55.640 and so because of their arrogant presumption
00:02:58.540 God allows Israel to lose the battle and the Ark is stolen
00:03:02.860 so the Philistines they take the Ark and they place it in the temple of their God Dagon
00:03:07.960 and then the God of Israel defeats the Philistines and their God Dagon
00:03:12.500 without an army by sending plagues on the people
00:03:16.200 and then the Philistines don't want the ark anymore obviously and they send it back to Israel
00:03:20.740 And the point of this little story seems to be this
00:03:23.540 God is not Israel's trophy and he opposes pride among the Philistines
00:03:29.060 but also among his own people and so Israel needs to remain humble and obedient
00:03:34.580 if they want to experience God's covenant blessing
00:03:38.000 which opens up into the next large section
00:03:41.020 The Israelite come to Samuel and they say hey we want to King like all the other nations have
00:03:45.820 Go find one for us and so Samuel he's kind of ticked off and he goes to consult with God
00:03:51.320 and God says yes their motives are all wrong
00:03:54.180 but if the king is what they want give them one
00:03:57.440 and so we're introduced as a figure of Saul
00:03:59.860 now Saul is a tragic figure because he begins full of promises, tall, he's good looking
00:04:05.860 He is a perfect candidate for a king but he has deep character flaws
00:04:10.660 he's dishonest, he lacks integrity and he seems incapable of acknowledging his own mistakes
00:04:17.000 and so these flaws become his downfail
00:04:19.600 he wins some battles at the beginning but his flaws went so deep
00:04:23.500 he eventually disqualified himself byblatantly disobeying God's commands
00:04:28.300 and so the aging Samuel confronts Saul and Israel
00:04:32.500 he had warned the people that they would only benefit from a king whose humble and faithful to God
00:04:38.400 otherwise the kings of Israel will bring ruin
00:04:41.620 so he informs Saul that God is going to raise up a new king to replace him
00:04:46.360 and so Saul's downfall begins
00:04:49.420 as God at the same time is working behind the scenes to raise up that new king
00:04:54.320 It's an insignificant shepherd boy named David
00:04:57.520 he's the least likely candidate to be king
00:05:00.580 but the famous story of David and Goliath shows
00:05:03.360 that God's choice of David is not based on his family status
00:05:07.540 but simply on his radical and humble trust in the God of Israel
00:05:12.460 and so this story embodies all of the themes of Hannah's poem
00:05:15.980 proud Saul and Goliath are broughtlow while humble David is exalted
00:05:22.060 From here we watched Saul slowly descend into madness while David rises to power
00:05:27.440 so David starts working for Saul as a general
00:05:30.340 and he's winning all of the battles and he's also winning all of the frame
00:05:33.840 and so Saul gets jealous and he starts chasing David around, hunting him, trying to kill him
00:05:39.630 David's done nothing wrong and so Davidsimply runs and waits in the wilderness
00:05:44.260 and here we see David's true character he has multiple opportunities to kill Saul
00:05:49.900 but he doesn't, he simply trust that despite Saul's evil, God will raise up a king for his people
00:05:57.140 What's interesting too is that many of the poems of David
00:06:00.260 that you find in the Book of Psalms are linked to this very period of his life
00:06:04.260 and they all expressed thesame attitude of trust
00:06:07.620 and so this section of the book ends with Saul coming to a grisly death after losing a battle with the Philistines
00:06:14.380 First Samuel tells some of the most intricate well told stories you find anywhere in the Bible
00:06:19.600 and the characters Saul and David they're portrayed very realistically
00:06:23.660 and the authors putting them forward as character studies so that you can find yourself in them
00:06:29.280 so Saul's story, we see a warning
00:06:31.940 it's crucial that we reflect on our own character flaws
00:06:35.920 and how they harm us and other people
00:06:38.600 and with God's help we need to humble ourselves and deal with our dark side
00:06:43.000 so that Saul's story doesn't become ours
00:06:45.600 David on the other hand is presented as an example of patience and trust in God's timing in our lives
00:06:52.560 and so he's running in the wilderness being chased by Saul
00:06:55.900 David had every reason to think that God had abandoned him
00:06:59.480 but that's not what he thinks and so David's story encourages us to trust
00:07:04.080 that despite human evil God is working out his purposes
00:07:08.880 to oppose the proud and to exalt the humble
00:07:12.220 and that's what first Samuel is all about
