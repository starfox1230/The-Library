00:00:02.820 The book of the prophet Isaiah
00:00:04.860 In the first video we explored chapters 1 to 39
00:00:07.600 Which was  Isaiah's message of judgment and hope for Jerusalem
00:00:10.900 He accused Israel´s leader of rebellion against God and said that through Assiria and then Babylon
00:00:17.540 Israel´s kingdom would come crashing down in an act of God´s judgment
00:00:21.560 and so chapter 39 concluded with Isaiah predicting Jerusalem´s fall to babylon
00:00:26.140 and the exile
00:00:27.580 and a hundred years after Isaiah it all sadly came to pass
00:00:31.100 but Isaiah´s greater hope was for a new purified Jerusalem where God´s kingdom would be restored through the future messianic king
00:00:38.320 and all nations would come together in peace
00:00:41.300 and so chapters 40 and following explore this great hope
00:00:45.600 the first main section chapters 40 through 48 open with an announcement of hope and comfort for Israel
00:00:52.120 the people are told that the babylonian exile is over and that Israel´s sin has been dealt with and a new era is beginning
00:00:58.700 so they should all return home to Jerusalem where God himself will bring his kingdom and all nations will see his glory
00:01:05.500 Now stop for a moment because this opening announcement raises a big question
00:01:10.380 that is ¿who is saying all of this? who´s voice are we hearing in these words of hope?
00:01:15.860 the perspective of the profet in these chapters is that of somebody whose living after the exile
00:01:21.340 in other words in the time period described by Ezra and Nehemiah
00:01:24.980 but Isaiah died 150 years before any of that so what are we supposed to make of this
00:01:30.280 Oh they´re many who think that is still Isaiah in his own day speaking
00:01:34.420 but  that he´s been profetically transported--so to speak-- 200 years into the future
00:01:39.160 and that he is speaking to the future generations as if the exile has passed
00:01:43.860 however the book of Isaiah itself gives us some clues that something else is probably going on
00:01:48.720 in chapters 8 and 29 and 30 we´re told that after Isaiah was rejected by Israel´s leaders
00:01:54.960 that he wrote and sealed up in a scroll all of his messages of judgement and hope
00:02:00.400 and that he passed it on to his disciples as a witness for days to come
00:02:05.180 eventually Isaiah died waiting for God to vindicate his words. Now remember chapters 1 to 39 were designed to show us that Isaiah predictions of judgement
00:02:14.640 were fulfilled in the exile, he´s a true prophet. And so after exile is over Isaiah´s disciples who have treasured his words for so long
00:02:23.140 open up the scroll and began applying his words of hope to their own day
00:02:28.260 so on this view the book of Isaiah consist of that first collection of Isaiah´s words
00:02:32.860 as well as the writings of his profethic disciples that God uses to extend Isaiah´s message of hope to future generations
00:02:40.520 whichever view you end up taking everybody agrees that these chapters are announcing that the future
00:02:45.920 hope has come, that God is fulfiling Isaiah´s prophetic promises
00:02:50.600 and so the prophet hopes that Israel will respond
00:02:53.020 by becoming God´s servant
00:02:54.600 that is after experiencing God´s justice and mercy through history
00:02:59.260 that they will now begin to share with the nations who God truly is
00:03:04.220 but that´s not what´s happening Israel instead of bearing witness to the nations is actually complaining
00:03:10.140 and even accusing God. They say:"the lord doesn´t pay attention to our trouble
00:03:14.620 in fact he´s ignoring our calls. The babylonian exile -- and understandably--  caused Israel to lose faith
00:03:21.820 in their God. I mean maybe he is not that powerfull, maybe the gods of babylon are way greater than our God
00:03:27.440 and so the rest of these chapters 41 to 47 are set up like a trial scene
00:03:31.860 God is responding to this doubts and accusations with the following arguments:
00:03:36.040 he says first: that the exile to babylon was not divine neglect
00:03:39.480 rather it was divinely orchestrated as a judgement for Israel´s sin
00:03:43.660 and second it was for Israel´s sake that God raised up Persia to conquer babylon so they could come back home
00:03:50.980 fulfilling Isaiah´s words
00:03:53.100 So the right conclusion that Israel should draw is that their God is the king of history
00:03:58.480 not the idols of the nations. In the fall of Babylon and the raise of persian king Sirus
00:04:03.300 Israel should see God´s hand at work and so become his servant telling the nations who he is
00:04:08.560 But by the end of the trial chapter 48 we find that Israel is still as rebellious and hardhearted as their ancestors
00:04:15.460 as so God disqualifies them as his servant but God´s still is on a mission to bless the nations and so
00:04:21.279 so the prophets says God´s going to a new thing to solve this problem
00:04:25.700 which moves into the next section 49 to 55. We´re introduced to a figure who´s called God´s servant
00:04:31.240 who´s going to fulfill God´s mission and do what Israel has failed to do.
00:04:35.460 God gives this servant the title Israel, and sends this person on a mission to -first of all-  restore
00:04:41.740 the people of Israel back to their God, but second to become God´s light to the nations.
00:04:46.720 and we´re told that this servant is empowered by God´s spirit to announce good news and to bring God´s kingdom over all of the nations
00:04:54.260 it sounds just like the messianic king from chapters 9 and 11, but then we learn the surprising way of how this servant will bring God´s kingdom
00:05:02.680 he is going to be rejected, and beaten and ultimately killed by his own people
00:05:08.020 in reality as he´s been accused and sentenced to death he is dying on behalf of the sin of his own people
00:05:15.680 the prophet says the servant´s death is the sacrifice of atonement for the people´s evil and rebelion
00:05:21.540 and then after his death, all of a sudden, the servant is just Alive again, and we hear that by his death he provided a way to make people righteous
00:05:30.240 That is to put them in a right relationship with God
00:05:33.160 and so this section concludes by describing two ways people can respond to the servant
00:05:37.700 some will respond with humility and turn from their sins and accept what God´s servant did on their behalf
00:05:43.620 these people are called "the servants" and also " the seed" remember the holy seed from chapter 6
00:05:49.460 these are the ones who will experience the blessing of the messianic kingdom
00:05:53.760 but there are others who are called simply "the wicked" they reject both the servant and his servants
00:06:00.400 which brings us to the final sections of the book 56 to 66 where the servants inherit God´s kingdom
00:06:06.760 these chapters are beautifuly designed as a simetry that brings together all of the themes of the book
00:06:12.400 at the very center are three beautiful poems that describe how the spirit empowered servant
00:06:17.880 is announcing the good news of God´s kingdom to the poor and he reafirms all of the promises of hope from earlier in the book
00:06:24.700 the new Jerusalem inhabited by God´s servants will be the place from  which God´s justice  and mercy
00:06:30.340 and blessings flow out to all the nations of the world and surrounding these poems are to  long prayers of repentance
00:06:36.860 where the servants confess Israel´s sin and they griev over all of the evil they see in the world arround them
00:06:42.820 and so they ask God to forgive them and that his kingdom would come here on earth as it is on heaven
00:06:48.900 now in each side of these prayers are collections of more poems that contrast the destiny of the servants
00:06:54.760 with that of the wicked who prosecute them. God says he´s going to bring his justice to all who pollute
00:07:00.220 his good world with their evil and selfishness and idolatry and it is going to remove them from his city forever
00:07:07.060 but the servants those who are humble before God and who repent and own their evil
00:07:12.320 they are forgiven they will inherit the new Jerusalem which we discover is an image for an entirely renewed creation
00:07:19.600 were death and suffering are gone forever and this brings us to the very outter frame of this part of the book
00:07:26.500 in this renewed world of God´s kingdom people from all nations are invited to come and join the servants of God´s covenant family
00:07:34.540 so that everyone could  know their creator and redemer and so the book of Isaiah end
00:07:39.580 with a very grand vision of the fulfilment of all of God´s covenant promises
00:07:44.200 through the suffering servant king God creates a covenant family of all nations
00:07:49.520 who are awaiting the hope of God´s justice and bringing a renewed creation
00:07:54.660 where God´s kingdom finally comes here on earth as it is in heaven
00:07:59.840 and that´s the very powerful hope of the book of Isaiah
