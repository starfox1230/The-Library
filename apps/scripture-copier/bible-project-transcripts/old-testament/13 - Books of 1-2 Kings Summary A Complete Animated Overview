00:00:02.920 The book of first and second kings
00:00:04.740 Although they are two separate books in our Bibles
00:00:06.920 They were originally written as one book telling a unified story
00:00:10.560 that continues on from the book of Samuel that came before it
00:00:13.889 So David has unified the tribes of Israel into a kingdom
00:00:16.929 and God promised that from his line would come a Messianic king
00:00:20.249 who would establish God's kingdom over the nation's and fulfill the promises made to Abraham
00:00:25.109 So the Book of Kings tells the story of the long line of Kings that came after David
00:00:30.089 and none of them lived up to that promise
00:00:32.729 In fact, they run the nation of Israel right into the ground
00:00:36.289 The book is designed to have five main movements
00:00:39.289 the story begins and ends focus on Jerusalem
00:00:42.769 First with Solomon's reign in the construction of the temple
00:00:45.689 and then in this last section ending with jerusalem's destruction and Israel's exile to Babylon
00:00:51.120 and the story leading up to this tragedy is what makes up the center three sections
00:00:56.120 which explain how Israel split into two rival kingdoms
00:00:59.220 how God tried to prevent the corruptionof Israel by sending the prophets
00:01:03.240 and how exile became unavoidable consequence of Israel's sins
00:01:07.680 The book opens with two chapters about the kingdom passing from the aging David to his son Solomon
00:01:13.480 and David's final words to Solomon they're very similar to those of Moses and Joshua and Samuel to the people
00:01:18.960 It's a call to remain faithful to the commands of the covenants
00:01:21.940 and to give allegiance to the God of Israel alone
00:01:24.920 but David's words bring somewhat hollow here
00:01:27.040 because David and Solomon then go on to conspire how they're going to consolidate this new kingdom
00:01:31.620 through a whole series of political assassinations
00:01:34.380 so it's not off to a great start
00:01:36.040 Solomon's brightest moment comes when he asked God for wisdom to lead Israel
00:01:40.680 and he even complete David's dream to make a temple for the God of Israel
00:01:44.400 Here the story actually stops and describes the design of this temple in detail
00:01:49.580 just like the tabernacle design in the Torah
00:01:52.360 there's all these gold and jewels and depictions of angels and fruit trees
00:01:56.340 It's all symbolism echoing back to the garden of eden
00:01:59.620 it's the place where heaven and earth meet where God's presence dwells with his people
00:02:04.520 but no sooner does Solomon finish the temple
00:02:06.759 but he makes them really horrible choices and the Kingdom falls apart
00:02:11.090 he starts marrying the daughters of other kings hundreds of them for political alliances
00:02:16.240 and then he adopts their gods and introduces the worship of those gods into Israel
00:02:21.220 Solomon then accumulates huge amounts of wealth he built a huge army
00:02:25.600 He even Institute slave labor for all of his building projects
00:02:29.170 Now if you go back to the Torah and look at God's guidelines for Israel's kings in Deuteronomy 17
00:02:35.280 Solomon is breaking every one
00:02:37.720 so by the time that he dies
00:02:40.049 Solomon resembles Pharaoh the king of Egypt more than he does his father David
00:02:44.260 the next section of the book opens with Solomon's son, Rehoboam, acting just like his father
00:02:49.620 it's a very sad story of greed and lust for power
00:02:53.100 he tries to increase taxes for slave labor
00:02:55.960 and under the leadership of Jeroboam the northern tribes reject this
00:03:00.420 they rebelled and secede and form their own rival Kingdom
00:03:03.769 and so now in the story you have the southern kingdom of Judah
00:03:07.440 centered in Jerusalem with Kings from the line of David
00:03:10.380 and now this new northern kingdom called Israel
00:03:13.440 who's capital will be Samaria eventually
00:03:16.140 Jeroboam also goes on to build two new temples to compete with Solomon's temple in the south
00:03:21.470 he put the Golden Calf in each one torepresent the God of Israel
00:03:25.110 The connection to Exodus 32 and the Golden CalfIt's all quite explicit
00:03:29.790 From this point on the story goes back and forth from north to south tracing the fate of both kingdoms
00:03:35.100 Each one had about 20 successive kings
00:03:38.080 and as the author introduces each king he evaluates their reign by a few criteria
00:03:43.020 did they worship the God of Israel alone or did they promote the worship other gods
00:03:47.900 did they deal with idolatry among the people
00:03:50.520 and did they remained faithful to the Covenant like David or do they become corrupt and unjust
00:03:56.140 and according to these criteria the author finds no good kings in northern Israel zero for twenty
00:04:02.300 And then in southern Judah only eight out of 20 get a positive rating
00:04:06.340 which connects to another huge purpose in this book
00:04:08.600 and that to introduce the role of the prophetkey figures in israel's history
00:04:13.140 so in the Bible, prophets were not fortune tellers rather they spoke on behalf of the God of Israel
00:04:19.000 and they played the role of Covenant watchdog
00:04:22.019 which means they called out idolatry and injustice among the Kings and the people
00:04:26.379 they were constantly reminding Israel oftheir calling to be a light to the nations
00:04:31.320 that they should obey the commands of the Torah
00:04:33.600 and so the prophets challenged Israel to repent and follow their God
00:04:37.500 In these centres sections for each King, God then raises up prophets to hold them accountable
00:04:43.400 the most prominent prophets over the northern ones are Elijah and his disciples Elisha
00:04:48.120 right here in the center of the book
00:04:49.860 Elijah was a wild man of a prophet living out in the desert
00:04:53.460 and his arch nemesis was the northern King Ahab and his Canaanite wife Jezebel
00:04:58.380 together these two had instituted the worship of the Canaanites God Baal over Israel
00:05:03.520 and so in a famous story Elijah challenged four hundred  and fifty prophets of Baal
00:05:08.340 to a contest to see which God was a real
00:05:10.319 so they both built altars and prayed totheir gods
00:05:13.420 but only the God of Israel answers with fire
00:05:16.640 After this, Ahab uses his royal power to murder an Israelite farmer and then steal his family's vineyard
00:05:23.040 and the Elijah again confront Ahab's injustice and he announces the downfall of his house
00:05:29.900 Elijah eventually passes the mantle ofhis prophetic leadership to a young disciple named Elisha
00:05:34.760 who asks for two times the authority of Elijah
00:05:38.360 but what's fascinating here is how the author is recounted 7 miraculous feats for Elijah
00:05:43.270 and then he offers stories of 14 acts of power from Elisha
00:05:48.570 Both prophets were clearly remarkable men and they played the same role confronting Israel's Kings
00:05:54.639 for idolatry and injustice and ultimately they were unsuccessful in turning Israel back from apostasy
00:06:01.260 In the next section, the northern kingdom has rocked by a bloody revolution started by a king named Jehu
00:06:07.760 who destroys Ahab's family and although Jehu was at first commissioned by God
00:06:12.860 his violence just gets out of control
00:06:15.480 and it creates the spiral of political assassinations and rebellions from which Israel never recovered
00:06:21.920 coup follows coup after Jehu
00:06:24.440 and each King follows other gods allows horrible injustice it all leads up to second Kings chapter 17
00:06:31.390 the big bad empire of Assyria swoopsdown and takes out the northern kingdom altogether
00:06:36.640 and the capital city of Samaria is conquered
00:06:39.780 and the Israelites were exiled and scattered throughout the ancient world
00:06:43.920 now chapter 17 is key
00:06:45.580 the author stops the story and offers this prophetic reflection and what's just happened
00:06:50.800 he blames the downfall of the northern kingdom on the idolatry
00:06:54.320 and covenant unfaithfulness of Israel and its kings
00:06:57.200 and so God has allowed them to face the consequences of their decisions
00:07:01.860 The final movement of the book tells the story of the lone southern kingdom
00:07:06.040 In here, we meet very heroic kings likeHezekiah who trust God
00:07:10.980 when the armies of Assyria come knocking on Jerusalem's door
00:07:14.280 or Josiah who discovers this lost scroll of the Torah in the temple
00:07:19.120 So he start to reading it. He's convicted
00:07:21.160 and he institutes religious reforms to remove idolatry in Canaanite influences from the land
00:07:26.940 but Judah is just too far gone
00:07:30.840 The King right in between these two, Menassah. He's the worst by far
00:07:34.880 so he not only introduces the worship of idols statues into the Jerusalem Temple,
00:07:39.780 he also institutes child sacrifice
00:07:42.900 And so God sends prophets to say the time is up. Israel has reached the point of no return
00:07:48.900 The final chapters tell the story of the Babylonian Empire coming to invade Jerusalem destroy the temple
00:07:55.190 and carry the people and the royal line of David off into exile
00:07:59.310 and so the story ends leaving us wondering has God done with Israel
00:08:03.010 has he done with a line of David
00:08:04.670 Well, the final paragraph zooms about forty years forward into the exile
00:08:09.310 and it tells very odd story. It's about Jehoiachin, a descendant from David
00:08:14.410 who would have been king and he was back in Jerusalem
00:08:16.910 and the king of Babylon releases him from prison and invite them to eat at the Royal table for the rest of his life
00:08:22.790 and the book ends
00:08:24.150 so it's not much but it's a story that gives a glimmer of hope
00:08:28.360 that God has not abandon the line of David
00:08:32.140 so the question now is how is that going to fulfill his promises to Abraham to David
00:08:36.799 How he is going to bless the nations and bring the Messianic Kingdom
00:08:40.000 and answer those questions you have to read on into the wisdom and the prophetic books
00:08:44.900 but for now that's the Book of Kings
