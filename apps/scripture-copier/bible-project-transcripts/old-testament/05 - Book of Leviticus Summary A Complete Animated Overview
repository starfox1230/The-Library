00:00:03.040 The book of Leviticus is the third bookof the Bible and it's set right after
00:00:07.160 the exodus of the Israelites from theirslavery when God brought them to the
00:00:11.020 foot of Mount Sinai and invited Israelinto a covenant relationship. Now they
00:00:15.670 had quickly rebelled and broken thecovenant. And God had wanted for his glorious
00:00:19.989 presence to come and live right in themidst of Israel in the form of this
00:00:23.779 Tabernacle, but Israel's sin has damagedthe relationship. So, at the end of the
00:00:29.200 previous book, Exodus, Moses as Israel'srepresentative could not even enter
00:00:34.559 God's presence in the tent. The Book ofLeviticus opens by reminding us of this
00:00:39.180 fundamental problem. It says the Lordcalled to Moses from the tent. So the
00:00:44.700 question is, "How can Israel in their sinand selfishness be reconciled to this
00:00:49.900 holy God?"  That's what this book is allabout--how God is graciously providing a
00:00:55.130 way for sinful, corrupt people to live inhis holy presence. Now let's pause for a
00:01:00.720 second and explore this reallyimportant idea that God is holy. It's
00:01:05.280 fundamental to understanding this book.The word holy means simply to be set
00:01:09.260 apart or unique. And in the Bible, God isset apart from all other things because
00:01:14.490 of his unique role as the Creator of all,as the author of life itself. And so if
00:01:19.070 God is holy, then the space around God isalso holy. It's full of his goodness and
00:01:25.010 his life and purity and justice. So ifIsrael, who is unjust and sinful, wants
00:01:31.229 to live in God's holy presence, they tooneed to become holy. Their sin has to
00:01:36.960 be dealt with. Thus, book of Leviticus. Now the book has a really amazing
00:01:41.409 symmetrical design. It explores the threemain ways that God helps Israel to live
00:01:46.860 in his presence. The outer sections aredescriptions of the rituals Israel was
00:01:50.970 to practice in God's holy presence. Thenext intersections focus on the role of
00:01:55.070 Israel's priests as mediators betweenGod and Israel and inside of that are
00:01:59.259 two matching sections that focus onIsrael's purity. And then right here at
00:02:03.290 the center of the book there's a keyritual, the Day of Atonement, that brings
00:02:06.950 the whole book together. The bookconcludes with a short section where
00:02:10.758 Moses calls on Israel to be faithful tothis covenant.
00:02:13.880 Let's dive into the book. The firstsection explores the five main types of
00:02:18.240 ritual sacrifices that Israel was toperform. Two of these were ways that, in
00:02:22.950 Israel, I could say "thank you" to God byoffering back to God the symbolic tokens
00:02:27.900 of what God has first forgiven them. Three other sacrifices were different ways of
00:02:31.890 saying sorry to God. So here in Israel, Iwould offer up the lifeblood of an
00:02:37.270 animal while confessing that their sinhas created more evil and death in God's
00:02:43.060 good world. But instead of destroyingthis person, God of course wants to
00:02:47.150 forgive them. And so this animalsymbolically dies in their place and atones,
00:02:51.780 which means it covers for their sin. And so through these rituals the
00:02:56.550 Israelites were constantly beingreminded of God's grace but also of his
00:03:01.040 justice and the seriousness of theirevil and its consequences. The second set
00:03:06.060 of rituals lays out the seven annualfeasts of Israel. And each of these retold
00:03:11.090 a different part of the story about howGod redeemed them from slavery in Egypt
00:03:15.810 and brought them through the wildernesson their way to the promised land.  And by
00:03:19.310 celebrating these feasts regularly,Israel would remember who they were and
00:03:24.220 who God was to them. Now the sectionsabout Israel's priests:  you have Aaron
00:03:28.800 and his sons first ordained to enterinto God's presence on behalf of Israel
00:03:32.980 and then in this matching section wefind the qualifications for being a
00:03:37.610 priest. The priests were called to thehighest level of moral integrity and
00:03:42.090 ritual holiness because they representedthe people before God but then also
00:03:46.520 represented God to the people. Now wefind out why the priests' holiness matter
00:03:51.750 so much. Back here in this first section,right after the family of Aaron was
00:03:55.910 ordained, two of his sons waltz rightinto God's presence and flagrantly
00:04:01.340 violate the rules. And so they areconsumed by God's holiness on the spot.
00:04:06.740 It's a haunting reminder of the paradoxof living in God's holy presence because
00:04:12.120 it's pure goodness, but it becomesdangerous to those who rebell and
00:04:17.089 insult God's holiness. And so it'simportant that Israel's priests become
00:04:21.750 holy and also that all of the peopleof Israel become
00:04:25.180 holy, which is what the nextintersections are all about.
00:04:28.490 Chapters 11 through 15 are about theritual purity required of all the
00:04:32.259 Israelites and chapters18-20 are about the moral
00:04:35.449 purity of the people. Here's what'sunderneath all of this purity and
00:04:39.289 impurity language. Because God is holy, and he's set apart, the Israelites need to
00:04:44.440 be in a state of holiness themselves.When they enter into his presence, this
00:04:48.380 was called being clean or pure. God'spresence was off limits to anybody who
00:04:53.460 was not in a holy state. And this wascalled being unclean or impure. Now in
00:04:58.530 Israel I could become impure in just afew ways: by contact with reproductive
00:05:04.169 body fluids, by having a skin disease, bytouching mold or fungus, or by touching a
00:05:09.949 dead body. Now for the Israelites, all ofthese were associated with mortality,
00:05:14.430 with the loss of life. Which gets us tothe core symbol of all these ideas. You
00:05:19.590 become impure when you're contaminated by touching death, so to speak. And death
00:05:25.370 is the opposite of God's holinessbecause God 's essence is life. Now this is
00:05:29.970 really key: simply being impure was notsinful or wrong. Touching these kinds of
00:05:35.349 things was a normal part of everydaylife and impurity was a temporary state.
00:05:39.860 It just lasted a week or two and then it'sover. What was wrong or sinful was to
00:05:45.400 waltz into God's presence carrying thesesymbols of death and impurity on my body.
00:05:50.820 Don't do that. Now the last way ofbecoming impure was by eating certain
00:05:54.280 animals. And the kosher food laws arefound right here in this section. Now
00:05:58.630 there have been lots of theories aboutwhy certain animals were considered
00:06:02.479 impure and off-limits. To promote hygiene or to avoid cultural taboos--the text
00:06:08.409 just isn't explicit. But the basic pointof all of these chapters is really clear.
00:06:12.430 Altogether these work as an elaborateset of cultural symbols that remind
00:06:18.080 Israel that God's holiness was to effect allareas of their lives.
00:06:22.960 This corresponding section over here isabout Israel's moral purity.  The
00:06:26.909 Israelites were called to livedifferently than the Canaanites.
00:06:29.660 They were to care for the poorinstead of overlooking them. They were to
00:06:33.570 have a high level of sexual integrity,and they were to promote justice
00:06:37.740 throughout their entire land. Now, here atthe center of the book we find a long
00:06:41.770 description of one of Israel's annualfeasts, the Day of Atonement. Odds are that
00:06:46.950 not every Israelite's sin and rebellionwould be covered through the individual
00:06:51.230 sacrifices and so once a year the highpriest would take two goats. One of these
00:06:56.320 would become a purification offering andatone for the sins of the people and the
00:07:01.400 other was called the scapegoat. Thepriest would confess the sins of
00:07:05.030 Israel and symbolically place them onthis goat and then it would be cast out
00:07:09.890 into the wilderness. Again, a verypowerful image of God's desire to remove
00:07:15.920 sin and its consequences from his peopleso that God can live with them in peace.
00:07:21.480 The book concludes with Moses callingIsrael to be faithful to all of the
00:07:25.910 terms of the covenant and he describesthe blessings of peace and abundance
00:07:30.070 that will result if Israel obeys all ofthese laws. He also warns them that if
00:07:34.610 they are unfaithful and dishonor God'sholiness, it will result in disaster and
00:07:39.490 ultimately exile from the land promisedAbraham. Now if you want to see how
00:07:43.980 Leviticus fits into the big storyline,it's helpful to look at the first
00:07:48.020 sentence of the next book of the Bible,Numbers. It begins,  "The Lord spoke to
00:07:53.150 Moses 'in' the tent," so we can see thatMoses is now able to enter God's
00:07:58.490 presence on behalf of Israel. The Book ofLeviticus, it worked! So, despite
00:08:03.220 Israel's failure, God has provided a wayfor their sin to be covered so that God
00:08:08.280 can live with sinful people in peace. Andthat's what the book of Leviticus is all
00:08:14.380 about.
