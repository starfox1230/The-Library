00:00:03.060 The book of Genesis is the first book of the Bible and it's storyline divides into two main parts
00:00:09.580 There's chapters 1-11, which tell the story of God and the whole world, and then there's chapters 12-50
00:00:15.500 which zoom in and tell the story of God and just one man, Abraham, and then his family.
00:00:20.880 And these two parts are connected by a hinge story at the beginning of chapter 12.
00:00:25.200 And this design, it gives us a clue as to how to understand the message of the book as a whole and how it
00:00:30.620 introduces the story of the whole Bible. So the book begins with God taking the disorder and the
00:00:36.260 darkness described in the second sentence of the Bible and God brings out of it order and beauty and
00:00:42.900 goodness and he makes out of it a world where life can flourish.  And God makes these creatures called humans
00:00:48.680 or "adam," in Hebrew.  He makes them in his image, which has to do with their role and purpose in God's world.
00:00:56.040 So humans are made to be reflections of God's character out into the world.
00:01:01.380 And they're appointed as God's representatives to rule his world on his behalf, which in context
00:01:07.760 means to harness all its potential, to care for it, and make it where even more life can flourish.
00:01:14.260 God blesses the humans.  It's a key word in this book.  And he gives them a garden, a place from which they
00:01:20.580 begin starting to build this new world. Now the key is that the humans have a choice about how they're
00:01:26.160 going to go about building this world and that's represented by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
00:01:31.100 Up till now, God has provided and defined what is good and what is not good.  But now God is giving humans the
00:01:38.740 dignity and the freedom of a choice: Are they going to trust God's definition of good and evil or are they
00:01:44.440 going to seize autonomy and define good and evil for themselves?  And the stakes are really high.
00:01:49.460 To rebel against God is to embrace death because you're turning away from the giver of life himself.
00:01:56.560 This is represented by the Tree of Life.  And so in chapter 3, a mysterious figure, a snake, enters into the story.
00:02:03.440 The snake's given no introduction other than it's a creature that God made.
00:02:08.100 And it becomes clear that it's a creature in rebellion against God and it wants to lead the humans into rebellion and their death.
00:02:15.880 The snake tells a different story about the tree and the choice.
00:02:19.300 It says that seizing the knowledge of good and evil are not going to bring death and that it's actually the
00:02:25.180 way to life and becoming like God themselves.  Now the irony of this is tragic because we know the humans
00:02:31.640 are already like God--they were made to reflect God's image.  But instead of trusting God, the humans seize autonomy,
00:02:38.900 they take the knowledge of good and evil for themselves, and in an instant the whole story
00:02:44.720 spirals out of control.  The first casualty is human relationships.  The man and the woman
00:02:49.460 they suddenly realize how vulnerable they are. Now they can't even trust each other.  And so they make clothes
00:02:54.580 and they hide their bodies from one another. The second casualty is that intimacy between God and humans is
00:03:01.560 lost.  So they go, run, and hide from God.  And then when God finds them, they start this game of
00:03:07.640 blame-shifting about who rebelled first.  Now right here this story stops and there's a series of short poems
00:03:13.420 where God declares to the snake, and then to the humans, the tragic consequences of their actions.
00:03:19.080 God first tells the snake that despite it's apparent victory, it is destined for defeat, to eat dust.
00:03:26.300 God promises that one day a seed, or a descendant, will come from the woman, who's going to deliver a lethal strike to the snakes head.
00:03:35.140 Which sounds like great news, but this victory is going to come with a cost because the snake, too,
00:03:40.720 will deliver a lethal strike to the descendant's heal as it's being crushed.
00:03:45.200 It's a very mysterious promise of this wounded victor. But in the flow of the story so far, you see that
00:03:52.320 this is an act of God's grace. The humans, they've just rebelled.  And what does God do?
00:03:56.600 He promises to rescue them. But this doesn't erase the consequences of the humans' decision.
00:04:02.840 So God informs them that now every aspect of their life together--at home, in the field--it's going to be
00:04:09.320 fraught with grief and pain because of the rebellion, all leading to their death.
00:04:15.460 From here, the story then spirals downward.  Chapters 3-11, they trace the widening ripple effect
00:04:21.300 of the rebellion and of human relationships fracturing at every level.
00:04:26.300 So there's the story of two brothers, Cain and Abel.  Cain is so jealous of his brother that he wants to murder him.
00:04:32.440 And God warns him not to give in to the temptation but he does anyway.  He murders him in the field.
00:04:37.860 So Cain then goes on to build a city where violence and oppression reign.  And this is all epitomized in this story
00:04:44.500 of Lamech.  He's the first man in the Bible to have more than one wife.  He's accumulating them like property.
00:04:50.880 And then he goes on to sing a short song about how he's more violent and vengeful than Cain ever was.
00:04:57.580 After this we get an odd story about the "sons of God, " which could refer to evil, angelic beings,
00:05:04.880 or it could refer to ancient kings who claimed that they descended from the gods.
00:05:10.720 And like Lamech, they acquired as many wives as they wanted and they produced the Nephilim, these great warriors of old.
00:05:17.620 Whichever view is right, the point is that humans are building kingdoms that fill God's world with violence and even more corruption.
00:05:25.700 In response, we are told that God is broken with grief, humanity is ruining his good world and they're ruining each other.
00:05:32.180 And so out of a passion to protect the goodness of his world, he washes it clean of humanity's evil with a great flood.
00:05:39.860 But he protects one blameless human--Noah, and his family.  And he commissions him as a new Adam.
00:05:46.820 He repeats the divine blessing and commissions him to go out into the world.  And so our hopes are really high
00:05:52.120 but then Noah fails too. and also in a garden. He goes and he plants a vineyard and he gets drunk out of his mind.
00:05:59.340 And then one of his sons, Ham, does something shameful to his father in the tent.  And so, here we have our new "adam," naked and ashamed,
00:06:08.780 just like the first.  And the downward spiral begins again.  It all leads to the foundation of the city of Babylon.
00:06:15.980 The people of ancient Mesopotamia, they come together around this new technology they have--the brick.
00:06:21.120 And they can make cities and towers bigger and faster than anybody's ever done before.  And they want to build
00:06:26.580 a new kind of tower that will reach up to the gods and they will make a great name for themselves.
00:06:32.960 It's an image of human rebellion and arrogance.  It's the garden rebellion now writ large.
00:06:39.960 And so God humbles their pride and scatters them.  Now this is a diverse group of stories but you can see
00:06:47.800 they're all exploring the same basic point: God keeps giving humans the chance to do the right thing
00:06:54.260 with his world and humans keep ruining it.  These stories are making a claim that we live in a good world that we have turned bad--
00:07:03.700 that we've all chosen to define good and evil for ourselves and so we all contribute
00:07:08.480 to this world of broken relationships, leading to conflict, and violence, and ultimately death.
00:07:15.720 But there's hope. God promised that one day a descendant would come--
00:07:20.380 the wounded victor who will defeat evil at its source.  And so despite humanity's evil, God is determined to bless and rescue his world.
00:07:29.780 And so the big question is, of course, "What is God going to do?" And the next story, the hinge, offers the answer.
00:07:36.540 But for now, that's what Genesis 1-11 is all about.
