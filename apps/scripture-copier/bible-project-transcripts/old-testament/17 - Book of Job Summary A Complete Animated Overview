00:00:02.940 The book of Job. It's a profound and veryunique book in the Bible for lots of
00:00:07.120 reasons. The story is set in a very obscureland that's far away from Israel, Uz.
00:00:12.750 The main character, Job, he's not even anIsraelite. And the author, who's anonymous,
00:00:17.990 doesn't even set the story in any clearperiod of ancient history. This all seems
00:00:22.740 intentional though. It's like the authordoesn't want us to be distracted by
00:00:26.830 historical questions but rather to focussimply on the story of Job and on the
00:00:31.900 questions raised by his experience ofsuffering. The book of Job has a very
00:00:35.829 clear literary design. It opens andcloses with a short narrative prologue
00:00:39.940 and then epilogue. And then the central bodyof the book is dense Hebrew poetry,
00:00:44.519 representing conversations between Joband four dialogue partners called "the
00:00:49.370 friends." These conversations are thenconcluded by a series of poetic speeches
00:00:53.530 given by God to Job. Let's dive in to seehow it works together. The prologue
00:00:58.289 introduces us to Job and we're told thathe's the blameless, upright man who
00:01:02.249 honors God. He's a super good guy. Andthen all of a sudden were transported
00:01:06.280 into the heavenly realms and God isholding court with his staff team. It's a
00:01:10.700 very common image in the Old Testamentdescribing how God runs the world. And
00:01:14.800 among the heavenly beings is a figurecalled "the Satan,"  which in hebrew
00:01:18.610 means "the Accuser" or "the Prosecutor."It's like we're watching a court scene.
00:01:22.770 God presents Job as a truly righteousman and then the accuser challenges
00:01:28.350 God's policy of rewarding righteous peoplelike Job. He says the only reason Job
00:01:33.180 obeys you is because you bless him withprosperity. Let Job suffer-- then we'll
00:01:38.350 see how righteous he actually is. And thenGod agrees to let the accuser inflict
00:01:43.090 suffering on Job. Now it's at this pointin the story that most of us go, "What? Why
00:01:48.080 did God do that?" and then we assume thatthis book is going to answer that
00:01:51.500 question--why God allows good people tosuffer. But as you read on, the book
00:01:56.080 doesn't answer that question. Nothingin the book ever answers that question.
00:02:00.890 The prologue is setting up the realquestions this book is trying to get at.
00:02:04.940 Questions about God's justice andwhether God operates the universe
00:02:09.100 according to the strict principle ofjustice. And the response to those
00:02:12.870 questions comes as you read through tothe end of the book, not at the beginning.
00:02:17.140 The ultimate reason for Job suffering issimply never revealed. So the prologue
00:02:22.270 concludes with a suffering andbewildered Job who's rebuked by his wife
00:02:26.340 and he's approached by three friends whoare going to try and provide wisdom and
00:02:30.010 counsel. Their names are Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite.
00:02:35.110 They are all non-Israelites, like Job.
00:02:37.220 And they represent thebest of ancient Near Eastern thinking
00:02:41.800 about God and suffering in the humancondition. And this moves into the main
00:02:45.750 part of the book. First Job speaks. Thisis how this section of the book works:
00:02:49.800 first, Job is going to speak and then will follow a response from a friend.
00:02:53.570 Then Job will respond to that friend and thenanother friend will respond to Job's
00:02:57.370 response and so on, back and forthfor three cycles. And this whole
00:03:01.010 debate has focused on three questions: "IsGod truly just in character?" and "Does God
00:03:06.600 run the universe on the strict principleof justice?" And if so, then how is Job's
00:03:11.640 suffering to be explained? As we're goingto see, Job and the friends, they're
00:03:15.860 working from a huge assumption aboutwhat God's justice ought to look like in
00:03:20.630 the world, namely that every single thingthat happens in the universe should
00:03:25.060 operate according to the strictprinciple of justice. So if you're a wise,
00:03:29.019 good person and you honor God, goodthings will happen to you. God will
00:03:32.750 reward you. But if you're evil and stupidand do sinful things, bad things will
00:03:37.440 happen to you. God will punish you. NowJob's constant arguments throughout his
00:03:41.320 speeches is this: first of all, that he'sinnocent and so the implication of that
00:03:45.799 is that his suffering is not a divinepunishment. Now we know from the prologue,
00:03:50.459 both of these things are true. Remember,God Himself said Job is righteous and
00:03:55.820 blameless. And so Job concludes his argumentby accusing God.  God either doesn't run
00:04:01.150 the world according to justice, or evenworse, God Himself is simply unjust. The
00:04:06.489 friends, on the other hand, they beg todiffer.
00:04:08.620 Their argument is that God is just. Theimplication being that God always runs
00:04:13.610 the world according to justice in thisway and so they conclude by accusing not
00:04:17.940 God, but Job. Job must have donesomething really, really bad for God to
00:04:22.830 punish him like this. They even startmaking up possible sins that Job must
00:04:26.970 have committed. Job protests all of this.In fact, he gets so fed up with the
00:04:30.850 friends that he eventually just gives upon them. He takes up his case directly
00:04:34.320 with God. Now something to be aware of isthat Job, he's on an emotional roller
00:04:39.540 coaster in these poems. He used to thinkthat God is just, but now he can't
00:04:43.500 reconcile that with his suffering. And so,in some outbursts Job will accuse God
00:04:48.230 of being a bully. Once he even declares thatGod has orchestrated all the injustice
00:04:52.890 in the world. But the moment he utters thatthought, he's terrified of it because he
00:04:57.240 wants to hope and believe that God istruly just.  Job is all over the place in
00:05:02.490 this section. And so he makes one laststatement of his innocence and then he
00:05:06.740 demands that God show up personally toexplain himself. Now it's at this point
00:05:11.270 that a surprise friend shows up,
00:05:13.710 Elihu the Buzite.  Now, he's not anIsraelite but he does have a Hebrew name.
00:05:18.140 And Elihu has the same assumption asJob and the friends. . He argues that God
00:05:22.810 is just and that that implies that Godalways operates the universe according
00:05:26.740 to justice. But then Elihu draws a moresophisticated conclusion about why good
00:05:32.140 people suffer. It may not be punishmentfor sin in the past.
00:05:36.640 God might inflict suffering as a warning tohelp people avoid sin in the future. Or
00:05:41.669 God might use pain and suffering tobuild character or to teach people valuable
00:05:45.760 lessons. Elihu doesn't claim to know whyJob is suffering but one thing he is certain
00:05:50.690 of: Job is wrong to accuse God of beingunjust. Job doesn't even respond to Elihu and
00:05:57.120 the dialogues come to a close . It's likethe wisdom of the Ancients has been
00:06:01.080 spent and the mystery remains. And thenall of a sudden God shows up in a
00:06:06.310 whirlwind and he responds to Jobpersonally. He first responds to Job's
00:06:10.890 accusation that he is unjust andincompetent at running the universe. So
00:06:15.460 God takes Job on a virtual tour of theuniverse and he starts asking him all these
00:06:19.940 questions about the order and origins ofthe cosmos. Was Job ever around when God
00:06:25.440 architected the earth or organized theconstellations? Has Job ever commanded
00:06:29.360 the sunrise or controlled the weather?
00:06:31.900 God has his eyes on all of these cosmicdetails that Job has never even
00:06:36.620 conceived of. Then God starts going intodetail describing the grazing habits of
00:06:41.590 mountain goats and how deer give birth,or the feeding patterns of lions and
00:06:46.260 wild donkeys. What's the point of allthis? Remember the assumption of Job and
00:06:50.510 his friends about what it looks likefor God to run the world according to
00:06:54.289 justice.
00:06:55.280 Underneath that assumption is a deeperone that Job and  his friends have a wide
00:07:00.260 enough perspective on life to make sucha claim about how God ought to run the world.
00:07:05.320 And God's response with this virtual tour,it deconstructs all of these assumptions.
00:07:09.900 It first of all shows that theuniverse is a vast, complex place and
00:07:14.950 that God has his eyes on all of it--everydetail. Job on the other hand, has only
00:07:20.330 the small horizon of his life experienceto draw from. His view of the world is
00:07:24.740 very limited and so what looks likedivine injustice from Job's point of
00:07:29.490 view needs to be seen in an infinitelylarger context. Job is simply not in a
00:07:34.680 position to make such a huge accusationabout God. After the virtual tour, God
00:07:39.300 asks Job if he would like to micromanagethe world for a day according to the
00:07:44.070 strict principle of justice that Job andhis friends assume; punishing every evil deed of
00:07:49.909 every person at every moment withprecise retribution.
00:07:53.979 The fact is that carrying out justice ina world like ours, it's extremely complex.
00:07:58.760 It's never black and white like Job andthe friends seem to think. Which leads to
00:08:03.580 God's last point. He starts describingthese two fantastic creatures,  Behemoth
00:08:08.099 and Leviathan, which some people thinkare poetic depictions of the hippo and
00:08:12.289 crocodile. More likely they refer towell-known creatures from ancient Near
00:08:16.550 Eastern mythology that are usedelsewhere in the Bible as symbols of the
00:08:21.310 disorder and danger that exists in God'sgood world. These creatures, they're not
00:08:26.190 evil. God is actually quite proud of them. But they're not safe either. The point is
00:08:30.779 that God's world is amazing
00:08:32.760 and very good but it's not perfect oralways safe. God's world has order and
00:08:37.909 beauty but it's also wild andsometimes dangerous, just like these two
00:08:42.679 fantastic creatures. And so we come backto the big question of Job's suffering.
00:08:47.220 Why is there suffering in God's world--whether it's from earthquakes or wild
00:08:51.580 animals or from other humans. Goddoesn't explain why. What he says is that
00:08:56.170 we live in an extremely complex, amazingworld that at this stage at least is not
00:09:02.330 designed to prevent suffering. And that'sGod's response. Job challenged God's
00:09:07.400 justice. God responds that Job doesn'thave sufficient knowledge about our
00:09:11.910 universe to make such a claim.
00:09:13.780 Job demanded a full explanation fromGod and what God asked Job for is trust
00:09:18.560 in His wisdom and character. And so, Jobresponds with humility and repentance. He
00:09:24.330 apologizes for accusing God and heacknowledges that he's overstepped his
00:09:28.150 bounds. Then all of a sudden the bookconcludes with a short epilogue. First
00:09:32.510 God says that the friends were wrong,that their ideas about God's justice
00:09:36.590 were just too simple-- not true to thecomplexity of the world or God's wisdom.
00:09:41.170 And then God says that Job has spokenrightly about him. Now this is surprising
00:09:46.430 because it can't apply to everything
00:09:48.850 Job said. I mean we know Job drew hastyand wrong conclusions, but God still
00:09:53.650 approves of Job's wrestling. How Jobcame honestly before God with all of his
00:09:58.630 emotion and pain and simply wanted totalk to God himself. And God says that's
00:10:03.660 the right way to process through all ofthis, through the struggle of prayer. The book
00:10:08.390 concludes with Job having his health, hisfamily, his wealth,
00:10:11.490 all restored-- not as a reward for goodbehavior but simply as a generous gift
00:10:16.300 from God. And that's the end of the book.The book of Job, it doesn't unlock the
00:10:20.590 puzzle of why bad things happen to goodpeople. Rather it does invite us to trust
00:10:25.770 God's wisdom when we do encountersuffering rather than try and figure out
00:10:30.480 the reason for it. When we search forreasons we tend to either simplify
00:10:34.930 God--like the friends-- or like Job,accuse God, but based on limited
00:10:39.930 evidence. And so the book is inviting us to honestlybring our pain and our grief to God and
00:10:45.110 to trust that God actually cares andthat he knows what he's doing. And that's
00:10:49.670 what the book of Job is all about.
