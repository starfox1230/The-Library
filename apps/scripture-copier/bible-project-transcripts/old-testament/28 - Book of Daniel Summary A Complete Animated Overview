00:00:02.880 The Book of Daniel.
00:00:04.230 The story is set rightafter Babylon's first attack on Jerusalem
00:00:07.899 and they had plundered the city and itstemple and taken a wave of Israelites into exile.
00:00:12.440 Among them were four men fromthe royal family of David.
00:00:15.780 Daniel, whose later named Belteshazzar
00:00:18.120 and his three friends, who you probably know by their Babylonian names:
00:00:21.700 Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.
00:00:23.839 This booktells of their struggles to maintain
00:00:25.440 hope in the land of their conquerors.
00:00:28.369 The book's design seems pretty simple at first--
00:00:30.780 Chapters one through six containsstories about Daniel and his friends in Babylon
00:00:35.360 while chapters 7 through 12contain the visions of Daniel about the future.
00:00:39.280 But this two-part shape is madeeven more interesting by another design feature.
00:00:43.180 And that's the book's language.
00:00:45.060 It begins in Hebrew, the language of the Israelites.
00:00:47.720 But chapters 2 through 7 are written in Aramaic,
00:00:50.720 a cousin language toHebrew spoken widely among the ancient empires.
00:00:54.550 But then in chapters 8 through 12 itgoes back to Hebrew.
00:00:57.430 This design shows how chapters 2 through 7 are a coherent section
00:01:01.070 but it also highlights the importance of chapters two and seven
00:01:04.870 for understanding the later chapters of the book.
00:01:07.390 Let's just dive in.
00:01:08.390 Chapter one introduces the basic attention of the first half of the book.
00:01:12.580 Daniel and his friends. They're really wise and capable.
00:01:15.159 And they're recruited to serve in theRoyal Palace of Babylon.
00:01:18.280 But they're pressured to give up theirJewish identity by living and eating
00:01:21.100 like Babylonians and violating theJewish food laws found in the Torah.
00:01:25.200 So they refuse and they choose faithfulness to the Torah and it puts them in danger.
00:01:29.900 But God delivers them and they end upbeing elevated by the king of Babylon.
00:01:33.700 After this begins the Aramaic sectionwhich you'll see has this really cool
00:01:37.719 symmetrical design.
00:01:39.159 So first the king of Babylon has a dream
00:01:41.400 that it turns out only Daniel is able to interpret.
00:01:44.500 It's about a huge statue madeof four types of metal
00:01:47.960 and it symbolizes a sequence of kingdoms and the head is Babylon.
00:01:52.270 But then a huge rock comes flying in and it shatters the statue
00:01:56.310 and it becomes this huge mountain.
00:01:57.980 Now this dream is the first of many symbolic visions in the book
00:02:01.780 and this one introduces the basicstory line of them all.
00:02:04.840 Daniel says that the statue represents a train of human kingdoms following from Babylon
00:02:09.539 and they will all fill God'sworld with violence.
00:02:12.320 But one day God's kingdomwill come and will confront and humble the arrogant kingdoms of this world
00:02:18.100 and fill the world with the healing justice of God's reign and rule.
00:02:22.500 After this, chapter 3 tells the famous story of Daniel's three friends
00:02:25.820 who refused to bowdown and worship a huge idol statue,
00:02:29.100 which like the statue in chapter 2represents the king in his imperial power.
00:02:33.740 So the friends are persecuted.They're thrown into a fiery furnace.
00:02:37.120 But God delivers them from death and they're exalted by the king
00:02:40.780 who now acknowledges their God is the true one.
00:02:43.440 After this come a pair of stories about two Babylonian kings,
00:02:47.020 the father, Nebuchadnezzar and then his son, Belshazzar.
00:02:50.420 They're both filled with pride because of their imperial power.
00:02:53.800 And so, like in chapter two, God warns them both through dreams and then visions,
00:02:58.380 which also like  chapter 2 only Daniel can interpret.
00:03:01.830 He says that both kings are to humble themselves before God
00:03:04.990 and both kings arrogantly resist.
00:03:07.910 So Nebuchadnezzar isstricken with madness.
00:03:10.330 He becomes like a beast in the field.
00:03:12.320 But then he humbles himself before God and his humanity returns to him.
00:03:16.360 He's restored as king.
00:03:18.390 This is in contrast with his sonBelshazzar who doesn't humble himself before God
00:03:23.080 and he's assassinated thatvery night.
00:03:25.650 Now these two stories draw this imagery from Genesis chapters one and two and Psalm 8
00:03:31.360 where humans are depicted as theroyal image of God.
00:03:34.920 He has given them authority to rule over the beasts of the field, the birds of the air
00:03:39.700 on behalf of God who is the world's true king.
00:03:42.620 But when human kingdoms forget that,
00:03:44.940 when they rebel and make themselves and their power into a "god,"
00:03:48.680 they become less than human like violent beasts who will face God's justice.
00:03:53.700 Which brings us to chapter six, the pair of chapter three.
00:03:56.940 And this time it's Daniel who is being persecuted
00:03:59.080 because he refuses to pray and worship the king as a god.
00:04:02.340 And so like the friends, he'ssentenced to death and he's thrown into a lion's den.
00:04:06.480 But God delivers him fromthe beasts
00:04:08.560 and like the friends, the king exalts Daniel and praises his God,
00:04:12.299 which brings us to chapter 7.
00:04:14.020 It's the pair of chapter 2 and the center of the book
00:04:16.560 where all its themes come together.
00:04:18.539 It's another dream but it's Daniel's thistime.
00:04:21.070 And ironically he cannot understand the dream until an angelic messenger explains it to him.
00:04:25.940 He sees a series offour beasts: the one like a lion
00:04:29.120 then like a bear, then one like a wingedleopard.
00:04:32.440 Each of these symbolizing an arrogant kingdom.
00:04:34.900 And last of all is a super beast identified as a really evil empire
00:04:38.960 and it has lots of horns -- a commonsymbol for kings in the Old Testament.
00:04:43.340 And there's one specific horn
00:04:45.360 who is an image of an arrogant king who exalts himself above God
00:04:49.510 and persecute God's people.
00:04:51.250 Now they are symbolized by a figurecalled the "Son of Man"
00:04:54.250 who is an image for both God's covenant people but alsofor their King from the line of David.
00:04:59.120 But then all of a sudden, God, who iscalled the Ancient of Days,
00:05:02.100 comes and He sets up His throne.
00:05:03.960 He destroys the superbeast and He exalts the Son of Man on the clouds
00:05:08.340 where he comes up to sit atGod's right hand
00:05:11.100 and share in God's rule over the nations.
00:05:13.480 We can look back nowand see how all of these stories  in the first half fit together.
00:05:18.000 The three stories of faithfulness despite persecution.
00:05:21.400 These are meant to offer hope to God-suffering people among the nations.
00:05:25.140 But they suffer because human kingdoms have rebelled against God and become beasts.
00:05:30.370 And so these visions encourage patience that God's people are to wait for him
00:05:35.680 to bring his kingdom and rule over ourworld and vindicate his suffering people.
00:05:40.120 But it raises the question about whenGod is going to do that and that's what
00:05:43.990 these final three visions set out toexplore.
00:05:46.570 In chapter 8, Daniel has another vision about the final two beasts of chapter 7.
00:05:51.130 But this time they are symbolized by aram who we're told is an image of the empire of the Medes and Persians.
00:05:56.820 And then by a goat who is an image of ancient Greece.
00:06:00.040 And out of the goat come a whole bunch of horns,
00:06:02.320 one of which symbolizes the evil kingfrom chapter 7.
00:06:05.620 And we're told more about him. That he will attack Jerusalem
00:06:09.060 and exalt himself above God and defile the temple with idols.
00:06:12.910 However in the end he will be destroyed by God
00:06:15.710 who will exalt His people and His kingdom.
00:06:18.450 Now by chapter 9, Daniel is very puzzled
00:06:20.810 especially as to when all of this is going to take place.
00:06:23.400 So he consults the scroll of the prophet Jeremiah
00:06:26.360 where God said that Israel'sexile would only last 70 years
00:06:30.190 so for Daniel the 70 years is almost upand
00:06:32.920 so he asked God to fulfill His promisesoon.
00:06:35.700 But an angel comes and informs him
00:06:37.870 that Israel's sin and rebellion hascontinued and so their time of exile and
00:06:42.910 oppression will continue on seven times longer than Jeremiah envisioned.
00:06:47.800 Daniel is deeply disturbed by this andhe has one final vision.
00:06:52.150 We're shown the same sequence ofkingdoms. It's Persia and then Greece and
00:06:55.900 Alexander the Great followed by lesserkings all leading up to this final king of the north,
00:07:01.740 who will invade Jerusalem, set up idols in the temple and exalt himself above God.
00:07:06.730 But then all of a sudden this king comes to ruin.
00:07:09.970 Now there's been endless debate about what all of these visions refer to.
00:07:14.310 Many see a clear connection to the exploits of the Syrian king Antiochus in the 160s BC.
00:07:20.360 He killed many faithful Jews inJerusalem and set up idols in the temple.
00:07:24.610 Others think it points forward to theRoman Empire's role in the execution of Jesus
00:07:29.300 and the destruction of Jerusalemand the Temple in AD70.
00:07:32.680 And still others think it will be fulfilled in future events that have yet to happen when Jesus will return.
00:07:38.740 Now the problem is that the symbols and the numbers they don't quite match any of these views perfectly.
00:07:44.700 But it opens up the possibility that in a sense they are all right.
00:07:48.790 The book of Daniel has been designed to offer hope to all future generations of God's people.
00:07:54.040 It did so in the days of Antiochus'Empire and it has ever since.
00:07:58.360 This is why Jesus could use imagery from Daniel to describe and confront the oppressive leaders he confronted in Jerusalem.
00:08:06.160 This is why John the visionary who wrote the Revelation could adapt Daniel's visions
00:08:10.240 and apply them to Rome of hisday and also all future oppressive empires.
00:08:15.720 And so the point of Daniel isthat all generations of readers can find here a pattern and a promise.
00:08:21.940 It's a pattern that human beings andtheir kingdoms become violent beasts
00:08:26.500 when they glorify their own power, when they redefine right and wrong
00:08:30.160 and don't acknowledge God is their true king.
00:08:32.530 But Daniel also holds out a promise that one day God will confront the Beast.
00:08:37.620 He will rescue His world and His people by bringing His kingdom over all nations.
00:08:43.059 And so for every generation, this bookspeaks a message of hope that should motivate faithfulness.
00:08:49.260 And that's what the book of Daniel is all about.
