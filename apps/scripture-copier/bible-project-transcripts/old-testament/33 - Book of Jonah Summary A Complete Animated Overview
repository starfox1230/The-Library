00:00:03.288 The Book of Jonah
00:00:04.603 A subversive story about a rebellious prophet
00:00:06.863 who hates God for loving his enemies.
00:00:09.600 Jonah’s unique among the prophets of the Old Testament
00:00:12.200 because they’re typically collections of God’s words spoken through the prophet.
00:00:16.448 But this book doesn’t actually focus on the words of the prophet;
00:00:19.402 rather it’s a story about a prophet,
00:00:21.402 a really mean and nasty prophet.
00:00:24.551 Jonah appears only one other time in the Old Testament;
00:00:27.210 it’s during the reign of Jeroboam II,
00:00:29.595 one of Israel’s worst kings.
00:00:31.300 And Jonah prophesized in his favor;
00:00:33.000 promising that he would win a battle
00:00:35.000 and regain all his territory on Israel’s’ northern border.
00:00:37.500 Now it’s important to know,
00:00:39.000 that the prophet Amos also confronted Jeroboam
00:00:41.595 and through him God specifically reversed Jonah’s prophesy;
00:00:45.000 promising that Jeroboam would lose all those same territories
00:00:48.300 because he was so horrible.
00:00:49.800 So before the story of Jonah even begins,
00:00:52.400 we are suspicious of Jonah’s character.
00:00:54.800 The book of Jonah has abeautiful design with all this literary
00:00:58.039 pairing and symmetry.
00:00:59.500 So you have chapters 1and 3, telling the story of Jonah's encounter with non-Israelites,
00:01:04.200 first with, some sailors and then with Jonah's hatedenemies, the Ninevites.
00:01:08.600 And each part offers a comic contrast between Jonah's selfishness and the pagans’ humility and repentance
00:01:15.400 Chapters two and fourcontain prayers of Jonah;
00:01:18.400 one is a prayer of repentance, kind of,
00:01:21.200 and the other is a prayer in which Jonah chews out God for being too nice.
00:01:25.300 Now thiscareful design of the book is matched by a really  unique style of narration.
00:01:30.800 The story's full of all of these stereotyped characters,
00:01:33.900 who ironically dothe exact opposite of what you think they would do.
00:01:37.500 So you have the prophet,the man of God, who rebels and hates his own God.
00:01:41.900 You have the sailors who aresupposed to be really immoral but
00:01:44.630 actually they have soft repentant heartsand turn to God in humility.
00:01:48.300 You have the king of the most powerful murderousempire on the planet
00:01:52.560 and he humbles himself before Godbecause of Jonah's five-word sermon.
00:01:56.800 And even the king's cows repent.
00:01:59.100 This kind ofstory fits what today we would call satire.
00:02:02.200 These are stories about well-knownfigures who are placed in extreme
00:02:05.900 circumstances and they use humor andirony to critique their stupidity and character flaws.
00:02:12.400 Let's just dive in and we'llsee how all the pieces work together.
00:02:15.459 The story opens as God addresses Jonah andcommissions him to go preach against the
00:02:19.420 evil and injustice in Nineveh, thecapital city of the Assyrian Empire, Israel's bitter enemy.
00:02:25.800 But instead ofgoing east to Nineveh, Jonah goes in the opposite direction,
00:02:29.800 finding a ship goingas far west as you can go to Tarshish.
00:02:33.200 Now the big question here is, why?
00:02:35.600 Why does Jonah run?Is he afraid? Does he just not like the Ninevites?
00:02:40.000 And were not told yet.
00:02:41.800 So the man of God tries to run from God.
00:02:44.600 And he boards a ship full of pagan sailors.
00:02:47.200 He goes down into the ship and then he falls asleep.
00:02:50.000 So God sends a huge storm to wake up His prophet.
00:02:54.400 Well, ironically the sailors above-board are wide awake to everything that's happening.
00:02:58.800 They can discern that there's a divine power atwork here.
00:03:02.000 So they throw the dice and they discovered that Jonah, he is the culprit.
00:03:06.000 So they ask Jonah to explain himself and Jonah spouts off a wholebunch of religious mumbo-jumbo he says
00:03:11.810 "Yeah, I'm Hebrew and I worship the LORDthe God who made the sea and the dry land."
00:03:17.000 What a joke, right?
00:03:18.530 God made the sea and the dry landalright,
00:03:21.000 and Jonah's dumb enough to run from this God by getting on a boat?
00:03:24.700 Andwhen the sailors ask Jonah what they should do,
00:03:27.600 he says "kill me, by throwing meoverboard."
00:03:30.500 Which kind of seems noble at first
00:03:32.700 until you realize this couldactually be his most selfish move yet.
00:03:36.590 I mean what better way to avoid going toNineveh.
00:03:39.600 So he puts his blood on these
00:03:41.389 innocent sailors hands by trying toforce them to kill him.
00:03:45.519 They're reluctant, of course. And theyrepent to God even as they tossed him over.
00:03:49.700 The storm subsides and they end upfearing the God of Israel.
00:03:53.900 And unlike Jonah, they actually worship God.
00:03:56.600 But Godfoils Jonah's plans to escape Nineveh.
00:03:59.700 As Jonah's sinking,
00:04:01.000 God provides this strange watery tomb for him,
00:04:04.500 the stomach of a large fish.
00:04:06.400 Now, of course under normal circumstances this would be certain death,
00:04:10.000 but in this story, everything's upside down.
00:04:12.700 And so Jonah'ssubmarine death becomes his passage back
00:04:16.700 to life.
00:04:17.329 Cramped in the stomach of this beast,Jonah utters a prayer;
00:04:20.399 where he never technically says that he's sorry
00:04:22.800 but he does thank God for not abandoning him
00:04:25.340 and he promises that he will obey Godfrom this point on no matter what.
00:04:29.300 And God's response is quite comic: the whale vomits
00:04:33.080 Jonah back onto dry land.
00:04:34.700 So once again Godcommissions Jonah to go and preach in Nineveh
00:04:38.000 and Jonah complies.
00:04:39.600 We're toldthat Nineveh was a gigantic city;
00:04:42.100 it would take days to walk through.
00:04:44.000 So Jonah getsone day in and here is his message
00:04:47.600 "Forty more days and Nineveh will beoverturned."
00:04:51.000 It's five words in Hebrew.
00:04:52.600 Now, his sermon is very short and it's alsoodd; I mean look at what's missing.
00:04:57.500 There's no mention of what the Nineviteshave done wrong
00:05:00.200 or of what they should do to respond.
00:05:02.400 There's no mention of whomight overturn them.
00:05:04.800 And most noticeable,
00:05:05.860 there's no mention of God.
00:05:07.500 What's going on here?
00:05:09.000 Has Jonah intentionally given the bare minimum of information?
00:05:13.000 It's like he's trying to sabotage his own message
00:05:15.300 or ensure the Ninevites destruction.
00:05:17.600 There's just no effort onJonas part here. Whatever his motives are,
00:05:21.830 the plan doesn't work.
00:05:23.500 Because no sooner does heutter this five-word sermon that
00:05:26.540 the king of Nineveh, the entire city includingall its cows, repent in sorrow and ashes.
00:05:31.960 So for the second time, these evil paganshow themselves to be more responsive
00:05:37.050 than God's own prophet.
00:05:38.800 So God forgives the Ninevites.
00:05:40.200 And He doesn't bring destruction on the city
00:05:42.500 Now here's thebrilliant part of the story.
00:05:44.720 The last word of Jonah's short sermon"overturned" means just that "turned over".
00:05:50.200 And it can refer to a city beingoverthrown or destroyed, like Sodom and Gomorrah.
00:05:55.300 But it can also be used ofsomething being transformed,
00:05:58.500 like turned over and changed into its opposite.
00:06:01.600 And socomically Jonah's words actually came true
00:06:05.650 but not in the way that he intended.
00:06:08.000 Nineveh does get turned over as Jonah's enemies repent and find God's mercy.
00:06:12.500 Thefinal chapter brings all the pieces together.
00:06:14.900 Jonah, he's fuming mad.
00:06:16.800 And he utters his second prayer.
00:06:18.800 He first tells God why he ran away back in chapter one.
00:06:22.500 It was not because he wasafraid.
00:06:24.200 Rather it was because he knew that God was so merciful.
00:06:28.000 And this is great,Jonah actually quotes
00:06:31.100 God's own description of Himself from the book ofExodus
00:06:33.900 and he throws it back in God's face as an insult
00:06:37.000 He says he knew that God is compassionate and that He would find
00:06:39.700 and that He would find some way to forgive these horrible Ninevites.
00:06:43.400 You can just hear the disgust in Jonah's voice.
00:06:45.600 Jonah then cuts off the conversation.
00:06:47.600 And he prays that God would kill him on the spot
00:06:50.500 He'd rather diethan live with the God who forgives His enemies.
00:06:54.200 Fortunate for Jonah, God doesn'tcomply
00:06:56.500 and simply asks if Jonah's anger is even justified.
00:06:59.800 Jonah  ignores thequestion and he goes outside the city
00:07:02.300 to camp on a nearby hill waiting to seewhat might happen,
00:07:06.100 you know, the Ninevites might repent of their repentance and get roasted after all.
00:07:10.600 What happens next is very odd.
00:07:12.000 God provides this viney plantto shade Jonah from the sun
00:07:15.800 and that makes him quite happy.
00:07:17.600 But then God sends a tiny worm to eat up the plant
00:07:20.700 and so Jonah loses his shade.
00:07:22.800 And there in theheat of the sun, Jonah asks again that God kill him.
00:07:27.000 So God again, asks Jonah if hisanger is justified and Jonah barks back
00:07:32.440 "Absolutely just let me die!" And thoseare Jonah's last words in the story.
00:07:37.940 God's final words or what concludesthe book.
00:07:41.200 He says that this whole vine incident was an attempt to get through to Jonah.
00:07:45.500 Right, Jonah got all concerned and  emotional over this vine,
00:07:48.600 which he only enjoyed for a day.
00:07:51.200 And God asked Jonah
00:07:52.600 "you know, aren't humans a bit more valuable thanvines?
00:07:56.200 I mean, isn't it ok if God might
00:07:58.800 feel the same kind of emotion andconcern for the city of Nineveh,
00:08:03.000 that's full of thousands of people, who havelost their way and also their cows?"
00:08:07.000 And that's how the book ends, with God askingJonah for permission to show mercy to His enemies.
00:08:12.800 And what is Jonah's answer? Thestory doesn't say. Because that's not the point.
00:08:16.600 The point is that the book is trying to mess with you. And God’s questions
00:08:20.800 And God's questions here actually addressed to you,the reader.
00:08:25.200 Are you ok with the fact that God loves your enemy?
00:08:29.500 And so this book holds a mirror upto the one who reads it.
00:08:33.700 In Jonah we see the worst partsof our own character magnified,
00:08:39.000 which should generate humility and gratitudethat God would love his enemies
00:08:43.799 and put up with the Jonah in all of us.
00:08:46.200 And so this strange storyactually becomes a message
00:08:50.130 of good news about the wideness ofGod's mercy that ought to challenge us to the core.
00:08:56.600 And that's the book of Jonah.
