00:00:02.930 The book of the Prophet Hosea. Hosea livedin the northern kingdom of Israel which
00:00:07.080 he sometimes calls Ephraim or Jacobabout two hundred years after they had
00:00:11.430 broken off from southern Judah. Rememberthe story from 1 Kings.
00:00:15.700 Hosea was called to speak on God´s behalf duringthe reign of one of Israel's worst Kings
00:00:19.740 Jeroboam the second. The nation wasdescending into chaos, and in the year
00:00:24.140 722 the big bad Assyrian empire swoopedin, and decimated Israel.
00:00:29.970 Again, see the story in 2nd Kings and Hosea had seenall of this coming.
00:00:34.840 the book is a collection of sometwenty-five years of his preaching and
00:00:38.170 writing it's almost all poetry and thiswhole collection has been designed to
00:00:42.000 have three main sections.
00:00:44.149 Lets just dive in you'll see how it works.The opening part tells the story of Hosea´s
00:00:48.340 broken marriage to a woman namedGomer, who commits adultery. Now it's not
00:00:53.120 totally clear whether Gomer slept aroundwith other men before or only after they
00:00:57.559 got married, but they did have threechildren together and things fell apart.
00:01:01.750 The important point is that God tells Hoseathat despite Gomer´s unfaithfulness He is
00:01:07.560 to go find her, to pay off her debts toher lovers, and to commit his love and
00:01:12.400 faithfulness to her once again, and thenGod says that all of this: the broken and
00:01:17.220 repaired marriage, the children, it's alla prophetic symbol telling the story of
00:01:21.880 God's relationship to Israel. So God hasbeen like a faithful husband to Israel,
00:01:26.220 He rescued them out of slavery, He broughtthem to Mount Sinai where He entered
00:01:29.700 into a covenant with them. He asked themto be faithful to Him alone, but then He
00:01:33.830 brought Israel into the promised landand they took all the abundance that He
00:01:37.490 gave them and they dedicated it to theworship of the Canaanite god Baal,
00:01:41.850 and so God has a legitimate reason. He could end the covenant and divorce
00:01:46.110 Israel and He thinks about doing so butinstead, He says that He's going to
00:01:50.540 pursue Israel again and renew Hiscovenant with them.  And He says why.
00:01:55.500 It's purely because of His own love,compassion and faithfulness. Hosea  then spells
00:02:00.689 out what all this means. He saysthe consequences for Israel's rebellion
00:02:04.820 will be imminent defeat by other nationsand exile.  But there's hope for future
00:02:09.229 restoration.
00:02:10.550 One day Israel will once again repentand come back to worship their God and
00:02:15.290 Hosea says He will place over them a newmessianic King from the line of David
00:02:19.880 who will bring God's blessing. And so thisopening section introduces all the main
00:02:24.540 ideas of the book.
00:02:25.830 Israel has rebelled and God's going tobring severe consequences but, God's own
00:02:31.020 covenant love and mercy are morepowerful than Israel's sin. And so in
00:02:36.010 the remaining sections of the book Hosea´s poetry explores these themes in more depth.
00:02:40.140 So there are two collections of hisaccusations and warnings for Israel and
00:02:44.350 then each of these is concluded by avery hopeful poem about God's mercy and
00:02:49.080 hope for the future.
00:02:50.310 So chapters 4 through 10, Hoseaexplores the causes and effects of
00:02:54.410 Israel's unfaithfulness. He says numeroustimes that Israel lacks all knowledge or
00:02:59.210 understanding of God. The Hebrew word "to know" which is Yadá it's more than just
00:03:04.490 intellectual activity it describedpersonal relational knowledge
00:03:09.860 Is the difference between just knowing aboutsomeone and then actually knowing that someone.
00:03:14.810 And God wants Israel to know Himlike that, in a relationship.
00:03:20.340 He wants them to experience His love for them andbecome the kind of knowledge that
00:03:24.950 transforms their hearts and lives sothat they love Him in return.
00:03:29.770 And so this is why Hosea is constantly exposing thehypocrisy of Israel's worship.
00:03:34.060 He constantly shows how they're breakingthe Ten Commandments, how they're
00:03:37.060 allowing grave injustice in theircommunities and then they go to their
00:03:41.250 sacred temples and they offer sacrificesto God like everything is just fine.
00:03:45.709 But it's not fine and not only because of their hypocrisy but because they're
00:03:50.310 worshiping all of these other gods too. He mentions many times their altars to Baal
00:03:54.570 at the cities of Bethel and Gilgal andnot only have they given their
00:03:59.130 allegiance to other gods Hosea repeatedly accuses Israel for trusting in their
00:04:02.959 political alliances with Egypt andAssyria. So instead of trusting God to
00:04:07.600 protect them they want to become likethese nations and rely solely on
00:04:11.750 military power and God says it's all goingto come crashing down on their head
00:04:17.000 because in not too long
00:04:18.870 Assyria will turn on them
00:04:20.649 and come to ravage their lands.  In this other section of warning  Hosea gives
00:04:25.520 an ancient Israelite history lesson toshow how this family's been unfaithful
00:04:29.889 from the beginning so he alludes to thepatriarch Jacob´s lying and treachery
00:04:35.080 --remember Genesis 27 and 28-- he alludes toIsrael's rebellion in the wilderness
00:04:40.039 --remember the Book of Numbers-- he alludes to their appointment of the corrupt King
00:04:44.229 Saul who led the people into sin anddisaster --remember the stories in 1
00:04:48.870 Samuel-- this is all Hosea´s  way ofsaying "some things in this family never
00:04:53.840 change." So what hope does Hosea have. What we know from Chapter 3
00:04:58.669 that God's going to do something to save and restore His people and that´s what
00:05:03.070 these two concluding chapters explore.Chapter 11 is beautiful. The poem depicts
00:05:08.669 God as a loving father who raised Hisson Israel and then shared everything
00:05:12.669 with him but the son grew up and rebelledand turned on the father, taking
00:05:17.560 advantage of His generosity and so inthis poem God is emotionally torn apart.
00:05:22.620 One moment He's angry and naturally Hesays He's going to bring severe
00:05:27.229 consequences but the next moment He'sheartbroken and then he says that He's
00:05:31.949 moved by His mercy and compassion andHe's going to forgive the son that He
00:05:36.750 loves. He says how can I give you up, Ephraim?  My heart churns inside of Me all my
00:05:42.599 compassion is aroused. And so while God did allow Israel to be conquered by Assyria
00:05:47.479 face the consequences... that's not God's final word
00:05:51.740 there's still hope. And that's what the last chapter is about.  Hosea calls Israel
00:05:56.639 to repent and turn back to their God but he knows that it won't last because it
00:06:00.830 never has before. And God says that one day He will heal their waywardness and
00:06:06.289 love them freely.   God goes on to describethis new healed Israel as a lush tree
00:06:13.000 that will grow deep roots and broadbranches and offer shade and fruit to all
00:06:17.860 of the nations. It's an image of God'spromise to Abraham - how Israel was to
00:06:22.680 become a blessing to the nations andGod is saying if that's ever going to happen
00:06:26.930 it's going to require an
00:06:28.969 act of God's grace and healing power torepair the deep brokenness and sinful
00:06:35.009 selfishness of the human heart so thatGod's people can receive His love and
00:06:40.779 love Him in return.
00:06:42.589 This is what God promises to do. Afterthis poem concludes we find the very
00:06:47.129 last words of the book.  They´re like anappended note. They're likely from the
00:06:51.659 author who collected Hosea´s  poetry andnow wants to speak to you the reader for
00:06:56.089 a second and he says who is wise anddiscerning to understand all of this, in
00:07:01.199 other words, Hosea´s poems. The ways of the Lord are right. The righteous walk
00:07:06.309 in them,  but the rebellious stumble in them, so theauthor wants you to know that Hosea´s
00:07:11.959 ancient poetry to northern Israel is notlocked in the past.   It reveals deep truth
00:07:18.349 about God's character and purposes andhuman nature and while God should and
00:07:23.849 does bring His justice on human evil, Hisultimate purpose, His heart, is to heal
00:07:30.029 and to save His people and that's what the book of Hosea is all about.
