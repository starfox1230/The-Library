00:00:02.920 The book of the prophet Joel. It's a shortcollection of prophetic poems that are
00:00:07.170 both powerful and puzzling. Joel isunique among the prophets for a few
00:00:11.580 reasons. First of all, there's no explicitindication of when this book was written.
00:00:15.809 It's most likely the period of Ezra-Nehemiah after the return from the exile
00:00:20.190 because he mentions Jerusalem and thetemple but there doesn't seem to be any
00:00:24.490 Kings. Also unique is that Joel isclearly familiar with many other
00:00:28.800 scriptural books; he alludes to or quotesfrom the prophets Isaiah, Amos, Zephaniah,
00:00:34.160 Nahum, Obadiah, Ezekiel, Malachi, even thebook of Exodus, and this is connected
00:00:39.510 with the last unique feature and that'sthat Joel never accuses Israel of any
00:00:43.820 specific sin. So like many of the otherprophets he announces that God's
00:00:47.790 judgment is coming to confront Israel'ssin but he never says why and that's
00:00:53.170 most likely because Joel assumes thatlike him you have been reading the books
00:00:57.640 of the prophets and so you already knowall about Israel's rebellion. Now all
00:01:01.769 together these three features helpus understand this fascinating little
00:01:05.630 book: that Joel is a biblical author whowas himself immersed in earlier biblical
00:01:10.759 writings and his reflection on themhelped him make sense of the tragedies
00:01:15.079 of his day, but also they gave him hopefor the future. Let's dive in and we'll
00:01:19.460 see how this book works. In chapters 1 and 2Joel focuses on the day of the LORD.
00:01:23.509 This is a key theme in the prophets andit describes events in the past when God
00:01:28.320 appeared in a powerful way to save Hispeople or confront evil, think about
00:01:33.020 the plagues in the book of Exodus. Butthe prophets saw in these past events
00:01:37.630 pointers to a future time when God wouldagain confront evil among his people but
00:01:42.840 also among the nations and bringsalvation to the whole world. And so here, in
00:01:46.880 chapters 1 and 2, Joel has brought twoparallel poems together that focus on this
00:01:51.840 theme, so chapter one is about a past dayof the Lord. He begins by announcing a
00:01:56.689 recent disaster that a locust swarm hasdevastated Israel and his description of
00:02:01.630 the swarm recalls the day of the Lordagainst Egypt, remember the eighth plague
00:02:05.969 from Exodus chapter 10, except this timethe locusts are being sent against
00:02:10.229 Israel, and so Joel calls on the eldersand the priests to lead the people in
00:02:15.580 repentance and prayer and then Joelactually himself repents along with all
00:02:20.290 of the priests. Chapter 2 comes alongside andit has the same poetic design and flow
00:02:25.370 of thought; so Joel announces another dayof the Lord except this time it's future
00:02:30.130 not past. It's an imminent disastercoming on Jerusalem. And he begins
00:02:34.350 describing what seems like another waveof locusts but he uses military and
00:02:39.100 cosmic imagery so the locusts becomeGod's army, like cavalry and soldiers
00:02:43.840 that are marching and destroyingeverything in their path. And the Sun has
00:02:47.360 darkened and the earth quakes and Joel says"The day of the Lord is dreadful; who
00:02:52.130 can endure it?" And so once more Joelcalls on the people to pray and repent.
00:02:56.610 And he says how: to rend your hearts notyour garments and return to your God.
00:03:02.640 In other words Joel knows thatrepentance can be just a show that you
00:03:06.310 put on to get out of trouble. And he saysGod's not interested in that. He wants
00:03:10.410 genuine change, for His people to stoptheir selfishness and evil, and then Joel
00:03:15.360 says why Israel should repent: becauseGod is gracious and compassionate, He's
00:03:20.290 slow to anger and He's full of love. He'squoting here from the book of Exodus
00:03:24.890 about how God forgave Israel after theymade the golden calf, and from that story
00:03:30.239 Joel learned that God's mercy and loveis more powerful than His wrath and
00:03:35.000 judgment and so he leads the priests inacts of repentance and prayer asking God
00:03:39.989 to spare His people. Then right afterthese two poems the scene shifts and we
00:03:44.510 have a short narrative about God'sresponse to the repentance of Joel and
00:03:48.470 the people: "So God was filled withpassion for His land and He had pity on
00:03:53.790 His people", and then God says He's goingto reverse the devastating effects of
00:03:58.580 this day of the LORD and turn it fromjudgment into salvation. So first, He's
00:04:02.959 going to defeat the threatening invaderswhich were presumably the locusts and He's going
00:04:07.989 to turn them all away to their own ruin.
00:04:10.100 Then He's going to restore thedevastated land and bring it back to
00:04:14.810 life making it up abundant once more. Andfinally, God says He's going to bring His
00:04:19.850 divine presence among His people, it willbecome real and accessible to everyone.
00:04:25.220 Now up to this point the poems tell apowerful story about Joel leading Israel
00:04:30.170 to see how their sin led to disaster anddivine judgment and that with the God of
00:04:34.630 mercy there is always hope. But Joelsees in all of these past events an image
00:04:40.490 of the future
00:04:41.710 day of the Lord. And so in the finalsection of the book Joel writes three
00:04:45.570 more poems that match God's three-partresponse and he weaves together images
00:04:51.080 from other prophetic books and expandsit all into a vision of hope for all
00:04:54.870 creation. So first the hope of God'spresence among His people gets expanded
00:04:59.280 into a promise about how one day in thefuture God's own spirit, His personal
00:05:04.120 life presence, will fill not just thetemple but all of His people. And here
00:05:08.810 Joel is drawing upon the promises ofIsaiah, and Jeremiah and Ezekiel that God's
00:05:13.720 Spirit would come to transform andempower His people so that they can
00:05:17.910 truly love and follow Him. Joel then picksup God's promise that He'll confront the
00:05:22.490 threatening invader. And Joel sees in theseravaging locusts a similarity to the
00:05:27.520 arrogant violent nations of his own daythat ravaged and oppressed people.
00:05:32.190 And so he draws upon the promises of Isaiah, and Zephaniah and Ezekiel about the future
00:05:37.070 day of the Lord when God will confrontevil among all the nations and turn their
00:05:42.000 violence back on themselves
00:05:43.950 bringing justice to right all wrongs. Andfinally Joel picks up the images of the
00:05:48.890 land's restoration, and he sees herea hope for the renewal of all creation.
00:05:53.770 So he draws on the promises of Isaiah andEzekiel and Zechariah that God's final
00:05:58.260 day of justice will be followed by arestoration of the entire world,
00:06:02.840 a new Eden where God's presence inJerusalem will flow out like a river and
00:06:08.410 bring about cosmic renewal. And so Joel'spoem ends with God's forgiveness and
00:06:13.540 mercy opening up a whole new creation.And so this little book of Joel, it
00:06:18.950 explores profound ideas about how human sin and
00:06:22.350 failure wreak such devastatingdestruction in our world, about how God
00:06:26.870 longs to show mercy to those who willjust own up to their sin and confess it,
00:06:32.160 and about how all of that leads us tohope that God will one day defeat evil
00:06:37.110 in our world but also inside of us andbring His healing presence to make all
00:06:42.090 things new. And that's what thebook of Joel is all about.
