00:00:03.920 The Song of Songs:  it's a well known but not so well understood
00:00:07.200 book of the Bible
00:00:08.340 It's 8 chapters of love poetry
00:00:10.100 And while there is an introduction, and a conclusion,
00:00:14.160 the book doesn't have any kind of rigid literary design
00:00:17.500 And that's because it's a collection of poems.
00:00:19.100 They're not meant to be dissected, or taken apart.
00:00:22.440 They're meant to be read as a flowing whole and simply enjoyed.
00:00:26.000 The first line of the book tells us that it's "the Song of Songs,"
00:00:29.160 which is a Hebrew idiom like, "the Holy of Holies" or "the King of Kings,"
00:00:32.920 it's a Hebrew way of saying, "the greatest thing"!
00:00:35.940 So this is the greatest song of all songs.
00:00:38.980 Then we're told in the first line that this "Song of Songs" is of Solomon –
00:00:43.260 – which could mean that he's the author, his name does begin the book after all.
00:00:47.580 But as you read the poems, you discover that the main
00:00:50.940 voice is that of a woman, called "the Beloved."
00:00:53.220 And while there is also a male voice, it does not
00:00:56.280 seem to be Solomon's.
00:00:57.760 Solomon is mentioned a couple times in the poem, but
00:01:00.600 he's never a speaker, and you do have to admit Solomon
00:01:03.480 is a very odd candidate as the author of this book, given
00:01:06.240 the fact that he had seven hundred wives...
00:01:09.760 For the lovers in the Song of Songs, they are the only ones in the world for each other.
00:01:14.560 So the "of Solomon" likely means "in the wisdom tradition of Solomon."
00:01:20.200 He was known for his wisdom, his poetry, his love of learning about every part of life.
00:01:25.880 And Solomon became the father of Wisdom Literature in Israel.
00:01:28.600 And so his legacy is here carried on, through a collection of love poems
00:01:32.740 that explore the human experience of love and sexual desire.
00:01:36.820 The opening poem introduces us to the basic theme of this book:
00:01:40.860 we hear the voice of the young woman, who delights in her man, a shepherd.
00:01:45.200 Now she's not married to him yet, but it becomes clear that they're engaged and they cannot wait
00:01:50.240 to be together.
00:01:51.580 From the introduction, the poems flow back and forth
00:01:55.100 from the woman's voice, to the man's, shifting from
00:01:57.880 scene to scene without any kind of clear, linear
00:02:00.100 sequence or storyline.
00:02:01.620 The poems move in the symphonic cycles
00:02:03.640 and key images and ideas get repeated and developed
00:02:07.500 So, one of the basic themes uniting the poems is the
00:02:10.860 intense desire this couple has for each other,
00:02:13.760 expressed through their constant seeking and finding.
00:02:16.780 So, after the opening poem, they're separated, but on
00:02:19.680 the hunt for one another.
00:02:21.140 So the woman calls out, or she'll wake up from a dream
00:02:24.460 and go looking for her lover, and more than once they'll
00:02:27.620 find each other, they'll embrace. And then right when
00:02:30.400 things start to get a bit racy, the scene will suddenly end.
00:02:32.920 And the new one will start: they're separated, looking for each other, and on it goes.
00:02:36.220 Another repeated theme is the joy of the couple's physical attraction for one another.
00:02:41.360 Multiple times they'll pause and describe each other
00:02:44.620 with these elaborate metaphors, and here it's very helpful to know
00:02:47.580 that these images and metaphors in Hebrew poetry
00:02:50.500 are not primarily visual.
00:02:52.260 If you try and paint a picture of these people, based on the metaphors
00:02:56.640 you will end up with something that looks very, very strange.
00:02:58.780 What you're supposed to do, is reflect on the meaning
00:03:01.460 of these images, as they relate to the man and the woman.
00:03:04.920 So you'll read through the poetic cycle, and the tension will keep building
00:03:08.300 and their desire and joy and attraction, and this spiraling
00:03:12.300 repetition is a poetic way of heightening and focusing
00:03:15.180 on the mystery and power of sexual love.
00:03:17.820 It all comes together in the conclusion, which
00:03:20.500 pauses to summarize what these poems are all about.
00:03:24.320 Love is as strong as death, its passions are as severe
00:03:28.320 as the grave, its flashes are of fire,
00:03:30.800 a divine flame. Many waters cannot extinguish love,
00:03:33.860 rivers cannot sweep it away. If one were to give all the
00:03:38.560 wealth of ones house for love, he would be utterly scorned.
00:03:42.400 The poem highlights the power and intensity of love –
00:03:45.520 how it's both beautiful, but also dangerous.
00:03:48.880 Like fire, love can destroy people if it's abused, or be
00:03:53.440 life-giving if it's protected.
00:03:55.840 Ultimately love expresses the insatiable human longing
00:03:59.520 to know and be fully known and desired by another.
00:04:03.360 Love is one of the most transcendent and mysterious
00:04:05.840 experiences in human life, and as part of the Bible's
00:04:09.680 wisdom tradition, this book says it's a gift from God.
00:04:12.560 After this, there's an odd poem about Solomon trying to do what the previous poem just said
00:04:18.399 was impossible: to buy love.
00:04:21.120 The woman rejects Solomon's offer and then the book
00:04:24.080 concludes with the man and the woman
00:04:25.440 – they're separate once more on the hunt for each other.
00:04:28.400 He calls to hear her voice, she begs him to run away
00:04:31.440 with her, and that's how the book ends.
00:04:35.280 Just totally open-ended.
00:04:37.040 But that's a lot like love!
00:04:38.640 Which never truly concludes, because there's always
00:04:41.680 more to discover and pursue in your beloved.
00:04:45.200 And so true love has no end.
00:04:47.600 And neither does this book.
00:04:49.440 Now, through history, the big question raised by the Song of Songs is,
00:04:52.880 "what on earth is love poetry doing in the Bible?"
00:04:56.160 There have been three main interpretations of this book
00:04:58.400 throughout history.
00:04:59.840 In Jewish tradition, it's been read as an allegory:
00:05:01.920 each character a symbol. So the woman is Israel, the
00:05:04.880 man is God, and their love is the symbol of covenant between God and Israel
00:05:09.600 made at Mount Sinai and the giving of the Torah.
00:05:11.680 This view flowed into the Christian tradition, but the characters were swapped.
00:05:16.400 So it's about Christ's love for His people
00:05:19.200 the Church. And this interpretation was inspired
00:05:21.520 by Paul's words in Ephesians 5:
00:05:23.600 – that a Christian husband's love for his wife is a symbol of Christ's love for the Church.
00:05:28.560 What's interesting is that in the last hundred years,
00:05:31.120 archaeological discoveries among Israel's ancient neighbors
00:05:34.240 and Egypt and Babylon, has turned up all kinds of ancient love poetry
00:05:38.640 that's very similar in language and imagery to the Song of Songs.
00:05:43.200 We see that love poetry was a meaningful part of Israel's
00:05:46.960 cultural environment, which has led most scholars
00:05:50.160 today to view the Song of Songs as what it presents itself to be:
00:05:52.160 an arrangement of Israelite love poetry reflecting on the divine gift of love.
00:05:57.280 But, that doesn't mean it's only ancient love poetry.
00:06:01.280 There's a key feature of these poems that sticks out when you
00:06:05.280 read them as a part of the Old Testament. And that's the
00:06:08.320 overwhelming use of garden imagery.
00:06:09.920 There are powerful echoes of the garden of Eden and
00:06:12.880 the idyllic scene between the married couple in the early chapters of Genesis.
00:06:17.280 So the image of the man and the woman naked
00:06:20.000 and vulnerable, but completely unified and safe with one another
00:06:24.480 – this resonates in the background of the Song of Songs.
00:06:28.160 It's as if in these poems, we are witnessing the love of a
00:06:31.760 couple whose relationship is untainted by selfishness and sin.
00:06:36.240 And so ultimately the Song holds out hope that even
00:06:39.600 though our own relationships are so often distorted by
00:06:43.120 selfishness, love is a transcendent gift.
00:06:46.000 And it's meant to point us to something greater, to the
00:06:49.200 gift of God's love that will one day permeate and transform
00:06:53.600 His beloved world. And that is what the Song
00:06:56.960 of Songs is all about.
