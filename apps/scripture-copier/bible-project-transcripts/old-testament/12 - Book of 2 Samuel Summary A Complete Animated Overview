00:00:03.020 The book of 2nd Samuel. Check out the video on First Samuel where we were introduced
00:00:06.850 to the book's three main characters:Samuel, Saul and David and
00:00:11.530 then also to the book's literary designwhich first introduced Samuel and then
00:00:16.199 traced the rise and fall of king Saul incontrast to the rise of king David.
00:00:21.260 2nd Samuel tells the story of Davidas Israel's King and in two movements;
00:00:26.260 there's a season of success and a blessing, followed by a huge moral failure and then sad consequences.
00:00:32.880 And then the book ends with this well-crafted conclusion that reflects back on the good and the bad in David's life,
00:00:39.200 generating hope for a future king to come from his line.
00:00:42.820 So 2nd Samuel picks up after Saul's death and David surprises everyone by composing this
00:00:48.360 long poem where he laments the death ofthe very man who tried to murder him.
00:00:53.890 And so once again the author is presenting David's humility and compassion;
00:00:58.110 he's a man who grieves the death even of his own enemies.
00:01:02.120 After this, David experiences a season of success and God's blessing. All of the Israelite
00:01:07.240 tribes they come to David then theyask him to unify all the tribes as
00:01:10.859 their king so the first thing David doesas king, is to go to the city of
00:01:15.139 Jerusalem, he conquers it, and heestablishes it as Israel's capital city
00:01:19.709 which he renames as Zion. And from there David goes on and he wins many battles
00:01:25.069 and expands Israel's territory. Now after making Jerusalem the political capital
00:01:29.270 of Israel he wants to make it theirreligious capital as well and so he has
00:01:33.740 the Ark of the Covenant moved into thecity and then in 2nd Samuel 7, he
00:01:39.060 tells God now that Israel has apermanent home he thinks that God's
00:01:43.749 presence should also get a permanenthouse so he asks if he can build a
00:01:47.569 temple for the God of Israel but God says toDavid: "Thank you for that thought but
00:01:52.340 actually I'm going to build you a house,a dynasty." Now 2nd Samuel 7, this is a
00:01:58.079 key chapter for understanding thestoryline of the whole Bible because God
00:02:02.639 here makes a promise to David that fromhis royal line will come a future king
00:02:07.919 who's going to build God's temple hereon earth and set up an eternal kingdom
00:02:12.540 and it's this
00:02:14.150 messianic promise to David that gets pickedup and developed more in the Book of
00:02:18.459 Psalms and also in the books of theprophets and it's this king that gets
00:02:22.629 connected to God's promise to Abraham.The future messianic kingdom will be how
00:02:28.090 God brings His blessing to all of thenations and it's right here in the midst
00:02:33.109 of all this divine blessing that thingsgo horribly wrong. David makes a fatal
00:02:37.329 mistake. Not fatal for him, but for aman named Uriah. One of David´s prized
00:02:41.769 soldiers. So from his rooftop Davidsees Uriah´s wife Batsheba, bathing. David
00:02:47.700 finds her, he sleeps with her, gets herpregnant and then he tries to cover the whole
00:02:51.340 thing up by having Uriah assassinatedand then marrying her. It is just horrible. So when
00:02:56.430 David´s confronted by the prophet Nathan about all of this, he immediately owns up
00:03:01.540 to what he's done. He is broken, he repents. He asks God to forgive him and God does
00:03:06.159 forgive him but, God doesn't erase theconsequences of David's decisions. And so
00:03:11.889 as a result of this horrible choiceDavid's family, his kingdom, and all falls
00:03:17.150 apart and makes this section a tragicstory, much like Saul´s downfall.
00:03:22.209 So David´s sons end up repeating his own mistakes but in even more tragic ways so
00:03:27.109 Amnon sexually abuses his sisterTamar and then their brother Absalom
00:03:32.389 finds out about all of this and hasAmnon assassinated and then Absalom goes
00:03:36.930 and he hatches the secret plan to ousthis father David from power and he
00:03:41.230 launches this full-scale rebellion andso for a second time David is forced to
00:03:45.879 flee from his own home and go hide inthe wilderness, except this time he is
00:03:50.459 not an innocent man. The rebellion ends when David's son is murdered. And it
00:03:55.930 breaks David's heart and so once again he laments over the very man who tried to
00:04:01.019 kill him.
00:04:01.959 David´s last days find him back on histhrone but as a broken man
00:04:06.190 man, he's wounded by the sad consequencesof his sin. The book concludes with a
00:04:10.690 well-crafted epilogue. With stories that are out of chronological order, but they
00:04:15.620 have this really cool symmetricalliterary design. So the outer pair of
00:04:19.980 stories come from earlier in David'sreign and they compared the failures of
00:04:23.880 Saul and then of David, and how each of them hurt other people through their bad
00:04:28.960 decisions. The next inner pair of stories are about David and his band of mighty
00:04:33.500 men, who went about fighting thePhilistines and what's interesting is
00:04:36.730 that both sections have a story ofDavid's weakness in battle, so in contrast
00:04:42.270 to the victorious David of chapters 1 through 9, here we see a vulnerable David, who is
00:04:47.460 dependent on others for help. The center of the epilogue has two poems that act
00:04:52.630 like memoirs, and David reflects back on his life and he remembers times when God
00:04:57.290 graciously rescued him from danger, and he sees these as moments where God was
00:05:02.960 faithful to His covenant promise to him and to his family. Both poems conclude by
00:05:08.900 looking back onto the hope of God'spromise of a future king who will build
00:05:13.750 that eternal kingdom. Now these poems and then God´s promise also connect back to
00:05:19.380 Hannah´s poem that opened the book. And so these key passages from the beginning
00:05:23.900 now the middle and the end of the bookbring the book's themes all together.
00:05:27.870 Despite Saul and David´s evil, God remained at work moving forward His redemptive
00:05:33.990 purposes. And God opposed David and Saul´s arrogance, but He exalted David when he
00:05:39.630 humbled himself. And so the future hope of this book reaches far beyond David
00:05:43.669 himself. It looks to the future to themessianic king who will one day bring
00:05:48.180 God's kingdom and blessing to all of thenations. And that´s what the book of Samuel
00:05:53.280 is all about.
