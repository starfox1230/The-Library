00:00:02.800 The book of the prophet Haggai.
00:00:05.220 It is one of the smaller prophetic books
00:00:07.200 but crucially important in the overall story of the Hebrew Bible.
00:00:11.020 For centuries, Hebrew prophets had been accusing Israel of breaking their covenant with God through idolatry and injustice.
00:00:17.740 They warned that God would send the great empire of Babylon to take out Jerusalem,
00:00:22.020 destroy the temple and haul off the people into exile.
00:00:25.860 It all happened in the year 587 BC but that was not the end of the story.
00:00:30.800 The prophets also believed that there was still hope and that God
00:00:33.840 would one day bring back a transformed remnant of his people Israel to live in a new Jerusalem
00:00:39.920 where God's presence would live in their midst.
00:00:42.440 When we turn to Haggai, the year is 520 BC, nearly 70 years after the exile.
00:00:48.040 The Babylonian Empire has recently collapsed and the world is now ruled by the Persians.
00:00:53.260 They allowed the return of any exiled Israelites who wanted to go back to Jerusalem, which still lay in ruins.
00:00:59.560 So, under the leadership of a high priest named Joshua and Zerubbabel,
00:01:03.620 an heir from the line of David, and a group of exiles they all returned
00:01:07.980 and begin to rebuild the city and their lives.
00:01:10.760 Remember the story from the book of Ezra chapters 1 to 6 .
00:01:13.740 So, our hopes are high and the future seems very bright.
00:01:16.720 But it is not, actually, at least from Haggai's point of view.
00:01:20.720 The book consists of four sections that summarize Haggai's message given to the people of Jerusalem
00:01:25.400 over the course of four months.
00:01:27.160 He opens by accusing the people of misplaced priorities.
00:01:30.260 So, yes, they have come back to Jerusalem  but they are spending
00:01:33.140 all of their time and resources rebuilding their own fancy houses
00:01:36.920 while the temple still lay in ruins from its destruction from 70 years ago.
00:01:41.840 So Haggai asks, are your own houses really more important than your allegiance to God?
00:01:47.320 This neglect, Haggai says, is tantamount to the covenant rebellion of their ancestors,
00:01:52.660 which is why the land is still unproductive,
00:01:55.240 why they have been struck with famine and drought.
00:01:58.300 Here, Haggai is quoting from the list of covenant curses in the book of Deuteronomy.
00:02:02.520 So, Haggai's challenging words are followed by a story of the people's response.
00:02:07.440 Remember the story in Ezra chapter 5.
00:02:10.100 We are told as Zerubbabel, Joshua, the remnant of the people were provoked by Haggai's message,
00:02:15.480 and they were motivated. They started rebuilding the temple.
00:02:18.280 In the next section Haggai follows up one month later.
00:02:21.200 He addresses some problems of shattered expectations among the people.
00:02:25.080 The temple that they are rebuilding is really pretty unimpressive.
00:02:29.120 It is nothing compared to the glory of the temple Solomon built here some 500 years earlier.
00:02:34.060 So morale was really low for finishing the project.
00:02:37.340 So Haggai reminds the people of the great prophetic promises of the future kingdom of God and about this temple.
00:02:43.620 He draws from the earlier prophets especially Isaiah and Micah about the new Jerusalem
00:02:48.900 and that it would be the place from which God would redeem the whole world
00:02:52.660 and where all nations would come and participate in God's kingdom, resulting in an era of peace.
00:02:57.720 So the temple plays a key role in God's plans for the future.
00:03:01.560 Haggai calls on the people to work in hope despite the disappointing circumstances.
00:03:07.760 In the third section, Haggai follows up two months later with a call to covenant faithfulness.
00:03:12.460 He engages some priests in a conversation about ritual purity.
00:03:16.000 Remember all the key ideas from the book of Leviticus.
00:03:18.820 He says if someone goes and touches a dead body and becomes ritually impure or marked by death
00:03:25.100 and then they go and touch some food, is that food impure too?
00:03:29.240 The priests, knowing the book of Leviticus, say, "Yes, it is impure."
00:03:33.220 Then Haggai turns this into a parable.
00:03:35.700 He says this is how it is with the people of Israel and what they are putting their hands to in rebuilding the temple.
00:03:42.060 If the current generation does not humble themselves, if they do not turn
00:03:45.890 from injustice and apathy then Haggai says whatever they build with their hands,
00:03:50.960 including this new temple will be impure too.
00:03:54.160 Haggai's challenge is that it is only by true repentance and covenant faithfulness
00:03:59.000 that their building efforts will result in God bringing his kingdom and blessing.
00:04:03.340 So, in a sense, Israel's future lay in their hands.
00:04:06.440 God is waiting for his people to be faithful.
00:04:09.060 So, the choice that Haggai is laying before the exiled generation
00:04:12.520 is very similar to the challenge Moses gave the wilderness generation before entering the land.
00:04:17.519 Their obedience will lead to blessing and success while faithlessness will lead to ruin.
00:04:23.040 The book concludes with Haggai's summary of the future hope of God's kingdom.
00:04:26.740 He is going to make the new Jerusalem the center of His glorious international kingdom.
00:04:31.240 From there He will confront and defeat evil among the nations.
00:04:34.900 He reminds people of the defeat of Pharaoh's army and the exodus story.
00:04:38.500 God will fulfill here his promise to David and establish the King from his line.
00:04:43.340 In Haggai's day, that was represented by Zerubbabel.
00:04:46.780 And so the book ends with the choice of a bright future just hanging there
00:04:51.440 So the question is, will Haggai's generation be faithful to God?
00:04:54.560 Will they experience the fulfillment of all these promises?
00:04:57.380 Will Zerubbabel be faithful?
00:04:59.380 Will he turn out to be the messianic king?
00:05:01.320 You have to just keep reading into the final two books of the prophets Zechariah and Malachi to find out.
00:05:07.480 But you can see how this little book contains a great challenge to every generation of God's people,
00:05:13.120 that our choices really matter,
00:05:15.840 and that the faithfulness and obedience of God's people is part of how God has chosen to work out His purposes in the world.
00:05:23.120 This surprising truth should motivate humility and action in God's people as they look forward to God's coming Kingdom.
00:05:31.800 That is the message of the book of Haggai.
