# https://www.youtube.com/watch/HPGShWZ4Jvk

00:00:03.160 The book of the prophet Malachi.
00:00:05.830 He lived about a hundred years after the Israelites had returned from their Babylonian exile.
00:00:10.040 And his message was directed to the people who had been living in Jerusalem for some time now.
00:00:14.880 The temple had been rebuilt a while ago and things were not going well.
00:00:19.660 Just remember the stories from Ezra and Nehemiah.
00:00:21.940 When the Israelites first returned from exile their hopes were high
00:00:25.580 they would return and rebuild their lives and the temple all of the great promises of the prophets would come true.
00:00:31.560 The Messiah would come and set up God's kingdom over a unified Israel and over the nations
00:00:36.200 and bring justice and peace for all.
00:00:38.280 But that is not what happened.
00:00:40.300 The Israelites who repopulated the city proved to be just as unfaithful to God
00:00:44.440 as their ancestors, resulting in poverty and injustice.
00:00:48.430 So in Malachi we find out just how corrupt this new generation has become.
00:00:53.000 The book is designed as a series of disputes.
00:00:55.620 Most sections begin with God saying something making a claim or an accusation
00:01:00.020 and then Israel will disagree or question God's statement.
00:01:03.640 Then God will respond and offer the last word.
00:01:06.680 This happens six times.
00:01:08.740 In the first three disputes.
00:01:10.300 God exposes Israel's corruption and in the final three disputes he confronts their corruption.
00:01:15.640 The overall impression you get from these arguments
00:01:18.850 and disputes is that the exile fundamentally didn't change anything in the people.
00:01:23.940 Israel's hearts are as hard as ever.
00:01:26.320 The first dispute starts when God says that he still loves his covenant people, despite their failures.
00:01:31.500 Israel rudely objects saying, "How have you shown us any love?"
00:01:35.640 So God reminds them of how he graciously chose the family of Jacob their ancestor to become the carrier
00:01:41.680 of God's covenant promises instead of Esau, his brother,
00:01:45.460 and the family that came from him, who eventually came to ruin.
00:01:49.180 Remember the stories from Genesis and the book of Obadiah.
00:01:52.263 So right from this first dispute, Israel is exposed as suspicious,
00:01:56.400 doubting God's love and faithfulness.
00:01:58.680 The second dispute exposes a problem with Israel's Second Temple.
00:02:02.020 God accuses the people of despising and defiling the temple
00:02:05.160 The people fire back, "How have we despised you?"
00:02:08.280 So God responds by focusing on the people,
00:02:10.620 how they are bringing shamefully lame offerings of these sick blemished animals
00:02:15.320 that show that they do not value or honor their God.
00:02:18.860 But it is not just the people. It is the priests, too, who run the temple.
00:02:22.400 Not only do they tolerate but participate in these corrupt forms of worship.
00:02:26.780 From top to bottom, God's people have proven faithless.
00:02:30.000 In the third dispute God accuses the Israelite men of treachery against him and their wives,
00:02:35.760 which, of course, they deny.
00:02:37.780 God exposes the toxic combination of idolatry and divorce taking place.
00:02:42.910 You have Israelite men marrying non-israelite women and then adopting the worship of their wives' ancestral gods into their homes.
00:02:50.180 Remember the story from Nehemiah chapter 13.
00:02:53.620 So Malachi connects this to a wave of men divorcing  their wives for no good reason.
00:02:59.860 The people are all fine with this.
00:03:01.360 Malachi says, "No, it is a betrayal of your covenant with God."
00:03:05.300 So Malachi transitions into the second set of disputes that confront Israel's rebellion.
00:03:10.800 The fourth dispute begins with the Israelites accusing God of neglect saying, where is the God of justice?
00:03:16.340 They see injustice and corruption abounding and God seems to do nothing.
00:03:20.620 God responds by saying that he will send a messenger who will prepare the people for God's personal return
00:03:26.860 in the day of the Lord. He will come like fire to purify His people
00:03:31.160 and to remove idolatry and sexual immorality and injustice
00:03:34.960 so that only the faithful remnant is left to become His people.
00:03:39.370 In the fifth dispute, God calls the people to turn back to him,
00:03:42.560 to which the people say, "How can we turn back?"
00:03:45.720 So God confronts their selfishness.
00:03:47.520 He shows how they have stopped offering a tithe of their income to the temple.
00:03:52.400 That word "tithe" just means "one-tenth".
00:03:55.040 It is the amount of their income and produce that Israelites were to annually donate to support the temple and its priests.
00:04:01.800 The practice is laid out in different parts of the Torah.
00:04:04.260 We know from Malachi and from the book of Nehemiah that the people were neglecting this responsibility.
00:04:09.860 So the temple was falling into disrepair.
00:04:12.238 So God confronts them. He says he wants to bless them with abundance, but only if they are going to be faithful.
00:04:18.168 In the final dispute that people accuse God and say that it is pointless to serve Him.
00:04:22.840 They observe wicked, prideful people succeeding in life and God does nothing.
00:04:27.880 God's response, for the first time in the book, is not a speech.
00:04:32.074 Rather, it is a short story about the faithful remnant in Israel, people who fear the Lord.
00:04:37.600 They love to get together and talk about how to honor God and serve Him.
00:04:42.120 So God orders that a scroll of remembrance be written for these people
00:04:46.660 so that they can read the scroll and remember God's character and promises.
00:04:50.640 Malachi is reflecting here on the divine gift of the scriptures,
00:04:54.800 how they point us to the past to remember what God has done
00:04:58.240 in order to inspire faithfulness and hope for the future
00:05:01.700 which leads to the conclusion of the book.
00:05:04.180 It picks up and develops the imagery of the fourth dispute
00:05:07.260 about the coming day of the Lord, but it develops it further.
00:05:10.209 God says that He has appointed a day of purifying judgment that will consume the wicked from among His people.
00:05:16.267 But what the conclusion adds is the future of the faithful remnant
00:05:20.230 because for them, the day of the Lord is not a threat;
00:05:23.860 it is a cause for joy. It will be like the rays of the rising sun that bring healing, life and hope for the future.
00:05:31.360 So Malachi's disputes come to a close but there is still a little bit more to this book.
00:05:36.440 The final three verses are not part of the disputes.
00:05:39.700 Actually, they function like a concluding appendix
00:05:42.550 bringing closure, not just to Malachi, but to the whole collection of the Torah and the Prophets.
00:05:48.240 First, the reader is called to remember the law or the Torah of my servant Moses.
00:05:54.060 This recalls the story and the laws of the covenant that you find in the first five books of the Bible.
00:05:59.240 Then we hear this summary of the books of the prophets:
00:06:02.520 I will send the prophet Elijah before the day of the Lord who will restore the hearts of God's people.
00:06:08.220 This conclusion summarizes the Torah and the prophets as a unified story that points to the future.
00:06:14.680 Israel was redeemed by God and then they betrayed him through their rebellion and hard hearts,
00:06:20.770 breaking the laws of the Torah.
00:06:21.920 But the Scriptures anticipate a future day when God is going to send a new prophet Moses, a new Elijah,
00:06:28.240 who will restore God's people and heal their hard hearts
00:06:32.320 Remember all of the promises from Deuteronomy, in Jeremiah and Ezekiel.
00:06:36.480 So, this concluding appendix presents the scriptures as a divine gift to read and to ponder and to pray over.
00:06:43.500 They tell the truth about the human condition, about our selfishness and our sin.
00:06:48.380 But they also announced God's promise that one day he would send a messenger
00:06:53.480 and then show up personally to confront evil, to restore his people, and bring his healing justice.
00:07:00.200 It is that future hope that Malachi and the Torah and all of the prophets are about.
