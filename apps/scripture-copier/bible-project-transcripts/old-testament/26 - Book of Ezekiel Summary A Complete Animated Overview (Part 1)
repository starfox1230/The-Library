00:00:00.000 The book of the prophet Ezekiel.
00:00:02.020 Ezekiel was a priest
00:00:03.400 who had been living in Jerusalem
00:00:04.920 during the First Babylonian Attack on the city.
00:00:07.500 And they spared the city
00:00:09.200 but they took a first wave of Israelite prisoners
00:00:11.420 and hold them off into exile.
00:00:13.220 And Ezekiel was among them.
00:00:14.960 So the book begins five years after all that.
00:00:17.640 And Ezekiel was sitting on the bank of an irrigation canal
00:00:20.980 near his Israelite refugee camp.
00:00:23.080 And it's his 30th birthday, no less--
00:00:25.280 the year that he would have been installed
00:00:27.220 as a priest in Jerusalem.
00:00:28.660 And then all of a sudden Ezekiel has this vision.
00:00:31.160 He sees a storm cloud approaching.
00:00:33.660 And then inside the cloud are four strange creatures
00:00:37.240 that have wings outstretched and touching each other.
00:00:40.480 And these creatures each had each four faces.
00:00:42.580 And then he saw four wheels-- one by each creature.
00:00:45.760 And then he saw that the wings of the creatures
00:00:47.980 were supporting this dazzling platform.
00:00:50.320 And on that platform is a throne.
00:00:52.720 And then sitting on that throne is this human-like creature
00:00:55.800 glowing and shrouded in fire.
00:00:58.440 And then all of a sudden Ezekiel realizes what he's seeing.
00:01:02.060 He calls it
00:01:03.140 "the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD."
00:01:07.060 It's God riding His royal throne chariot.
00:01:10.560 Now the word "glory."
00:01:11.360 In Hebrew it's "kavod."
00:01:12.900 It means "heavy" or "significant."
00:01:15.160 The biblical authors use this word
00:01:17.300 to describe the physical appearance and manifestation
00:01:20.640 of God's significance when He shows up in person.
00:01:24.260 These images in the vision,
00:01:25.480 they're very similar to what happened
00:01:26.900 when God appeared on Mount Sinai on the book of Exodus.
00:01:30.000 And is also very similar to the depictions of God's presence
00:01:33.680 over the Ark of the Covenant.
00:01:35.240 And that's actually the most shocking thing about Ezekiel's vision,
00:01:38.720 "What is God's glory doing in Babylon?"
00:01:41.920 It's supposed to be above the Ark of the Covenant
00:01:44.440 in the temple in Jerusalem.
00:01:46.300 And so the first section of the book opens to explore that question
00:01:50.620 as Ezekiel begins to accuse Israel of rebellion.
00:01:53.660 So God first speaks to Ezekiel from the throne chariot
00:01:56.640 and He commissions him as a prophet.
00:01:58.400 Ezekiel is to accuse Israel of breaking their covenant agreement with God in a couple of ways.
00:02:04.060 Israel has given their allegiance to other gods
00:02:06.400 and has been worshipping idols
00:02:08.340 and this has all led to
00:02:09.520 rampant social injustice and violence.
00:02:12.180 And so as a result,
00:02:13.100 God appoints Ezekiel to warn the people.
00:02:16.080 The first Babylonian attack
00:02:18.020 that took Ezekiel into exile
00:02:19.840 is going to be matched by another.
00:02:22.020 And Jerusalem, its temple,
00:02:23.820 all face imminent destruction.
00:02:26.360 So Ezekiel uses words and more
00:02:28.920 to get his message across.
00:02:30.340 He also performs sign acts.
00:02:32.820 These were a form of street theater.
00:02:34.920 Ezekiel would go out on public
00:02:36.700 and start behaving in this really bizarre ways
00:02:39.300 that were like parables of his prophetic message.
00:02:42.420 So he was supposed to build a tiny model of Jerusalem
00:02:45.640 and then staged an attack of it.
00:02:47.320 Or he was to shave off all of his hair
00:02:49.620 and then chop it up with a sword.
00:02:51.400 Or the most extreme,
00:02:52.520 he was to play the role of the scapegoat
00:02:54.560 on the Day of Atonement.
00:02:55.980 And he would lay on his side for over a year
00:02:58.800 eating food cooked over poop
00:03:01.340 as a sign of the nasty food that people would have to eat
00:03:04.560 during the siege of Jerusalem.
00:03:06.380 And perhaps the most disheartening thing of all
00:03:08.780 is the bad news God gave Ezekiel--
00:03:11.220 that no one was going to listen to him.
00:03:13.540 Israel would reject him
00:03:15.560 because of their rebellious and hard heart.
00:03:18.140 And this recalls Moses' description of the people after the wilderness rebellion
00:03:22.600 when he predicted that exile would one day happen.
00:03:25.660 And Ezekiel had the unfortunate privilege of seeing it all come to pass.
00:03:29.640 And so a dismayed Ezekiel, he begins to perform his task.
00:03:33.400 And after about a year he has another vision.
00:03:35.780 This one is about the temple.
00:03:37.000 He goes on this virtual tour of the temple
00:03:39.840 and he sees what's happening there in his absence.
00:03:42.200 And it is not good.
00:03:43.620 In the outer courtyard, in front of the temple,
00:03:45.860 he sees this large idol statue.
00:03:47.840 And then he sees the elders of Israelworshiping other gods,
00:03:51.360 both outside and inside the temple.
00:03:53.820 And then he sees the women of Israel,
00:03:55.860 they're worshiping a Babylonian god named Tammuz.
00:03:59.120 And the vision ends with God's glorious throne chariot
00:04:02.360 moving up and away from the temple.
00:04:04.700 It's leaving, going east headed towards Babylon.
00:04:08.060 And so in chapter 11 we come to see why and how
00:04:11.100 God's glory appeared to Ezekiel there in Babylon.
00:04:14.180 Israel's idolatry and their covenant violations.
00:04:17.320 It's become so blatant and offensive
00:04:19.500 that God has left His temple.
00:04:22.160 They've driven Him away
00:04:23.300 and He consigns it to destruction.
00:04:25.800 But God hasn't abandoned His people.
00:04:27.680 Rather He goes into exile with them.
00:04:30.360 And so at the end of this vision in chapter 11,
00:04:32.760 God promises that He will return a remnant of Israel back to the land.
00:04:36.880 And He'll transform them
00:04:38.200 by removing their heart of stone
00:04:39.680 and giving them a new soft heart of flesh.
00:04:42.760 So that they can love and truly follow their God after all.
00:04:46.120 This is a small glimmer of hope.
00:04:48.200 And it's quickly submerged under the reality of the imminent destruction.
00:04:52.480 But chapter 11, it's a key transition.
00:04:54.760 And it helps us understand how the rest of the book has been designed.
00:04:57.880 So the next three sections are all announcements of God's judgement.
00:05:01.820 First, on Israel.
00:05:02.700 Then, on the nations around Israel.
00:05:04.600 And then on Jerusalem itself.
00:05:06.660 But then after that,
00:05:08.280 the hopeful conclusion of chapter 11 gets developed
00:05:11.280 in the final 3 sections of the book.
00:05:13.080 First, hope for Israel.
00:05:14.900 Then for the nations.
00:05:15.820 And then for all creation.
00:05:17.920 Chapters 12-24 focus on God's judgment coming to Israel.
00:05:21.980 And this is a diverse collection of poems and essays.
00:05:25.300 And here Ezekiel shows his fondness for parable and allegory.
00:05:29.120 So he depicts Israel as a burnt useless stick,
00:05:32.320 or as a rebellious wife,
00:05:34.180 or as a dangerous raging lion that gets captured,
00:05:37.900 or as two promiscuous sisters.
00:05:39.900 These are all depictions of Israel's senseless rebellion and idolatry
00:05:44.060 that results in their ruin.
00:05:46.640 In this section, Ezekiel also acts like a lawyer.
00:05:48.780 He begins arguing to the case.
00:05:50.780 That first of all, Jerusalem's destruction is truly deserved
00:05:54.720 after centuries of covenant violation.
00:05:56.860 And that even if the most righteous people in the world
00:06:00.060 like Noah, or Daniel, or Job
00:06:01.840 were alive and praying for God to spare Israel
00:06:05.160 God would not accept their prayers.
00:06:07.260 It's far too late.
00:06:08.600 And so God's goodness actually demands
00:06:10.560 that He bring justice on this generation of Israel.
00:06:13.700 The exile has become inevitable.
00:06:16.260 They've reached the point of no return.
00:06:18.560 Following this, Ezekiel focuses first on the nations immediately around Israel.
00:06:23.380 And then on the two most powerful states in the region:
00:06:27.000 Egypt and then Tyre.
00:06:28.480 Israel has allied with these nations
00:06:30.480 and adopted their gods and their idols.
00:06:32.640 And so God accuses the kings of Tyre and Egpyt
00:06:35.380 for arrogantly viewing themselves as gods
00:06:38.300 who get to define right and wrong on their own terms.
00:06:41.340 And God holds these kings accountable for their pride
00:06:43.780 and he announces that He will use Babylon to bring them down
00:06:47.420 They will face God's justice along with everybody else.
00:06:50.520 Following these really intense sections
00:06:53.120 is a short story in chapter 33.
00:06:55.320 Ezekiel's met by a refugee
00:06:57.260 who's just arrived from Jerusalem
00:06:59.180 and he gives him the report.
00:07:00.560 The Babylon has attacked the city of Jerusalem.
00:07:03.140 That the city has fallen and the temple was destroyed.
00:07:06.900 Ezekiel's grim warnings have become a reality.
00:07:09.860 But remember the end of chapter 11,
00:07:12.060 that's not the end of the story.
00:07:14.060 And so on the next video,
00:07:15.480 we'll explore Ezekiel's profound vision of hope.
00:07:18.560 But for now, that's the first half of the book of Ezekiel.
