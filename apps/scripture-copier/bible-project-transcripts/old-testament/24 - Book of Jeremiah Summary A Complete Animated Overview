00:00:02.860 the book of the Prophet Jeremiah Jeremiah was an Israelite priests who lived and worked in  
00:00:07.660 Jerusalem during the final decades of the kingdom of southern Judah he was called as a prophet to  
00:00:12.430 warn Israel about the severe consequences of breaking their covenant with God through their  
00:00:16.600 idolatry and injustice and he even predicted that the Empire of Babylon would come as God's servant  
00:00:22.360 to bring this judgment on Israel by destroying Jerusalem taking the people into exile and sadly  
00:00:28.750 his words became reality Jeremiah lived through the siege and destruction of Jerusalem and  
00:00:34.150 witnessed the exile personally now this book came into existence in a really interesting way chapter  
00:00:40.030 36 tells us that after 20 years of Jeremiah's preaching in Jerusalem God called him to collect  
00:00:45.790 all of his sermons and poems and essays and commit them to writing which Jeremiah did by employing  
00:00:50.950 a scribe named Baruch who wrote down and compiled all of this material into a scroll now Baruch also  
00:00:56.620 gathered lots of stories about Jeremiah and he linked all the pieces together and so this is why  
00:01:01.840 the book reads like an anthology a collection of collections it's all been arranged to present this  
00:01:07.180 prophet as a messenger of God's justice and grace so the book begins with God calling Jeremiah to be  
00:01:13.600 a prophet and he's given a dual vocation he will be a prophet to Israel but also to the nation's  
00:01:19.600 and his words will both up rout and teardown but also plant and build up in other words he's going  
00:01:26.020 to accuse Israel and warn them of God's coming judgment but he also has a message of hope for  
00:01:31.300 the future now this opening perfectly summarizes the first large section chapters 1 to 24 it's a  
00:01:37.240 collection of Jeremiah's writings from before the Exile and the core idea here is that Israel has  
00:01:42.790 broken the covenant with God and violated all the terms of the agreement they made that are written  
00:01:47.740 in the Torah and in a number of ways they've adopted the worship of all kinds of Canaanite  
00:01:52.450 gods building idol shrines all over the land and jeremiah develops the metaphor of idolatry  
00:01:57.700 as adultery and uses the language of prostitution promiscuity unfaithfulness to describe how Israel  
00:02:05.140 has given their allegiance to other gods Jeremiah also repeatedly accuses Israel's leaders the  
00:02:11.380 priests Kings the other prophets have all become corrupt they've abandoned the Torah and covenant  
00:02:17.130 which has led to a tragic result rampant social injustice the most vulnerable people in Israelite  
00:02:24.000 communities the widows orphans and immigrants were all being taken advantage of in clear violation of  
00:02:30.090 the laws of the Torah and Israel's leaders didn't even seem to care so a classic place where all of  
00:02:35.820 these ideas come together is in Chapter seven it's called Jeremiah's temple sermon the Israelites are  
00:02:40.680 coming to worship their God in the temple as if everything is just fine but outside the temple  
00:02:45.510 they are worshiping other gods and some were even adopting the horrifying Canaanite practice  
00:02:50.520 of child sacrifice and so Jeremiah makes his very unpopular announcement the God of Israel is  
00:02:57.300 coming in judgment he's going to destroy his own temple and punish Israel by sending an enemy from  
00:03:03.690 the north this is an army that God would allow to conquer Jerusalem and as you read on you discover  
00:03:08.940 he's talking about the great Empire of Babylon and so this all leads up to a transition in chapter 25  
00:03:14.460 Israel hasn't turned back to their God and so in the first year of babylons new king Nebuchadnezzar  
00:03:19.860 God tells Jeremiah to announce that the Babylonian armies are headed for Israel and all of its  
00:03:25.050 neighbors to conquer them and take them into exile for 70 years he compares Babylon to a cup of wine  
00:03:31.110 filled to the brim with God's just anger at all of Israel's injustice and idolatry and God will make  
00:03:38.160 Israel and the nation's drink from this Cup now this chapter is key to the books design because  
00:03:44.070 everything that follows is going to focus on babylons coming attack first on Israel in chapters  
00:03:49.320 26 to 45 and then on the other nations in chapters 46 to 51 the section about Israel first contains  
00:03:56.430 stories about how Jeremiah begged Israel to turn back how he warned them right up to the last  
00:04:01.230 minute but the leaders of Israel kept rejecting him the section concludes with a large collection  
00:04:07.140 of stories about how Jerusalem was under siege and eventually destroyed by Babylon and about how  
00:04:12.210 Jeremiah was persecuted all through that time and eventually kidnapped and taken against his will to  
00:04:17.430 Egypt by a group of Israelite rebels now right here in the middle in between all of these dark  
00:04:22.980 stories of disaster and judgment is a collection of Jeremiah's messages of hope for Israel's future  
00:04:28.920 so he picks up on Moses diction that after Israel had broken the Covenant and gone into exile see  
00:04:35.080 Deuteronomy 30 God would not abandon his people rather he would renew his covenant with them and  
00:04:41.170 transform their hearts jeremiah develops this promise and he says that god is going to one day  
00:04:46.240 inscribe the laws of the Torah not on tablets but rather on the hearts of his own people he's going  
00:04:53.110 to heal their rebellion so that they can truly one day love and follow him fully and so one  
00:04:59.410 day Israel will return back to the land and the Messiah from the line of David is going to come  
00:05:04.630 and that's when all nations will come to recognize Israel's God as the true God so these chapters are  
00:05:10.990 showing that despite Israel's apostasy God is not going to let Israel sin get the final word  
00:05:16.270 rather his own faithfulness will bring about the fulfillment of his promises no matter what after  
00:05:23.020 this we find a large collection of poems about how God is going to use Babylon to judge the nations  
00:05:28.240 around Israel so Egypt Philistia Moab Edom Amman Damascus Hazor but then surprisingly the longest  
00:05:37.390 poems are saved for last and they're about God's coming judgment on Babylon itself so although God  
00:05:43.420 used this nation to execute as justice God doesn't endorse their violence in idolatry and so Babylon  
00:05:49.780 2 will come under the standard of God's justice and so Jeremiah denounces this nation's pride  
00:05:54.910 and injustice as well now Babylon is larger than life in these poems and it reminds us of the image  
00:06:01.540 of Babylon all the way back from Genesis chapter 11 Babylon has become the archetypal rebellious  
00:06:07.480 nation in their glorification of wealth and war God's going to give this nation over to its own  
00:06:13.360 destruction the book concludes with a story taken from the end of the book of second Kings it tells  
00:06:18.820 about babylons final attack on Jerusalem how they destroyed the city walls and burn the  
00:06:23.830 temple and took the people into exile the story shows how Jeremiah's warnings of judgment from  
00:06:29.140 chapters 1 through 24 were fulfilled but then the chapter ends with a short story about the captive  
00:06:35.290 Israelite king Jochen he's heir to the line of David and the king of Babylon releases him from  
00:06:40.750 prison and shows him favor and invites him to eat at the Royal table for the of his life and that's  
00:06:45.760 how the book ends so it's a little glimmer of hope and this recalls Jeremiah's promises of  
00:06:51.790 hope from chapters 32 33 God hasn't abandoned his people or the promise of a future coming king from  
00:06:58.480 David's line and so while this book contains a huge amount of warning and judgment the final  
00:07:05.140 words conclude with a note of hope for the future and that's what the Book of Jeremiah is all about
