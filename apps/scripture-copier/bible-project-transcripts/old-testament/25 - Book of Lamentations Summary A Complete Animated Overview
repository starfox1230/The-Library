00:00:02.630 the Book of Lamentations it's a unique book in the Old Testament that contains five poems from  
00:00:08.480 an anonymous author who survived and is now reflecting back on the Babylonian siege of  
00:00:13.880 Jerusalem and the destruction and exile that followed remember the whole story from the  
00:00:18.230 book of second Kings the fall of Jerusalem in the Exile was the most horrendous catastrophe  
00:00:23.660 in Israel's history up to this point so remember God had promised Abraham the land he'd given David  
00:00:29.150 victory to make Jerusalem Israel's capital and from David came the royal line of kings you had  
00:00:35.180 God's presence there in the temple and that's where the priests maintained the rituals of  
00:00:39.530 Israel's worship and after five hundred years of all of this history in the summer of 587 BC the  
00:00:45.860 city fell to Babylon it was all decimated and gone and so the Book of Lamentations is a memorial to  
00:00:52.910 the pain and confusion of the Israelites that followed this destruction now the lament poems  
00:00:58.190 found here are not unique in the Bible there's lots of them in the Book of Psalms and these  
00:01:02.270 biblical poems of lament they do a number of things they're a form of protest they're a way  
00:01:07.490 of drawing everybody's attention including God's attention to the horrible things that happen in  
00:01:12.380 this world that should not be tolerated they're a way of processing emotion so in these poems God's  
00:01:18.320 people vent their anger and dismay at the ruin caused by people's sin and selfishness and these  
00:01:24.590 poems are placed a voice confusion suffering makes us ask questions about God's character  
00:01:30.260 and promises and none of this is looked down on in the Bible just the opposite these poems of lament  
00:01:36.380 give a sacred dignity to human suffering and so these human words of grief that are addressed to  
00:01:42.170 God have now become part of God's Word to his people the design of these five poems is very  
00:01:48.290 intentional it's part of the book's message so chapters 1 through 4 are called acrostics which  
00:01:53.690 means alphabet poems each poetic verse begins with a new letter of the Hebrew alphabet which  
00:01:58.940 is made up of 22 letters now this very ordered and linear structure it's in stark contrast to  
00:02:05.000 the disorder of the pain and the confused grief that's explored in these poems so it's like Israel  
00:02:10.550 suffering is explored a-to-z and is trying to express something that is in Express chapter's  
00:02:16.790 wanted to each have one verse per letter giving them a really similar design but the themes are  
00:02:21.380 very different so chapter 1 focuses on the grief and shame of a figure called lady Zion the poet  
00:02:27.290 personifies the city of Jerusalem as a widow also called the daughter of Zion and she sits alone  
00:02:32.960 she's bereaved of her loved ones devastated no one comes to comfort her it's a very powerful metaphor  
00:02:39.200 and then lady Zion speaks she calls on the Lord to notice her fate and through this image the poet  
00:02:45.680 he's showing that the city's destruction brought a level of psychological trauma on the Israelites  
00:02:50.840 that can only be expressed as the experience of a funeral and the death of a loved one chapter 2  
00:02:57.860 focuses on the fall of Jerusalem and how it was a consequence of Israel's sin and was brought about  
00:03:03.380 by God's wrath which is a key word in this poem now it's important to remember that in the Bible  
00:03:09.320 God's wrath is not spontaneous volatile anger the biblical poets and prophets they used this word to  
00:03:15.860 talk about God's justice so Israel had entered a covenant agreement with God and for centuries  
00:03:22.190 they've been violating it by worshiping other gods perpetrating injustice so pressing the poor and  
00:03:27.470 so yes God is slow to anger but he eventually does get angry at human evil and he will bring  
00:03:34.730 his just anger in the form of punishment in the case of Jerusalem this involved allowing Babylon  
00:03:40.700 to come and conquer the city and so this poem is acknowledging that God's wrath is justified  
00:03:45.530 but this doesn't keep the poet from lamenting and asking God to show compassion once again chapter 3  
00:03:52.370 breaks this design pattern by having three verses per letter so it's the longest poem in the book  
00:03:56.900 and the voice is that of a lonely man speaking out of his suffering and grief as a representative of  
00:04:02.540 the whole people and what's interesting is that this chapter is full of language that's drawn from  
00:04:07.160 other parts of the Old Testament from the laments of Job and from other important lament Psalms and  
00:04:12.620 even from the suffering servant poems in Isaiah and the poet sees his hardship as a form of God's  
00:04:18.110 justice like chapter 2 said but paradoxically this is what gives the poet hope and it leads  
00:04:23.960 him to offer the only hopeful words in the whole book because of the Lord's covenant faithfulness  
00:04:28.790 weed Parrish His mercies never fail they're new every morning how great is your faithfulness Oh  
00:04:35.770 God so I say to myself the Lord is my inheritance therefore I will put my hope in him so the poet  
00:04:43.420 reasons if God is consistent enough to bring his justice on human evil then he'll also be  
00:04:48.340 consistent with his covenant promise to not allow evil to get the final word and so for this poet  
00:04:54.460 God's judgment is the seedbed of hope for the future chapter 4 goes back to the same alphabet  
00:05:00.640 structure as chapters 1 and 2 and it's a vivid and disturbing depiction of the two-year siege  
00:05:06.040 in Jerusalem and it contrasts how things used to be in Jerusalem of the past and how terrible they  
00:05:11.980 became in the siege so children used to laugh and play in the streets but now they beg for food the  
00:05:18.430 wealthy used to eat lavish meals but now they eat whatever they can find in the dirt and the  
00:05:24.040 royal leaders used to be full of splendor but now they're famished and dirty and unrecognizable and  
00:05:29.500 the anointed king from the line of David has been captured and dragged away so the poem's  
00:05:34.900 power comes from the shock of these contrasts and it's exploring the depth of the suffering that  
00:05:40.540 is real brought on itself now the final poem is unique because it breaks the design pattern it's  
00:05:46.180 the same length as all of the other alphabet poems but the alphabet order is gone it's like  
00:05:51.580 the poet can't hold it together anymore and his grief has exploded back into chaos the poem is  
00:05:57.520 a communal prayer for God's mercy Israel begs God not to ignore their suffering or abandon to them  
00:06:04.330 and the poem offers a long list of all of the different kinds of people who were devastated  
00:06:09.310 by the fall of the city they ask God not to forget these people and they lament on behalf of others  
00:06:16.180 giving voice to their pain suffering in silence is just not a virtue in this book God's people  
00:06:23.410 are not asked to deny their emotions but voice their protests to vent their feelings and pour  
00:06:29.620 it all out before God the book ends with something of a paradox the poet acknowledges that God is the  
00:06:35.110 eternal king of the world but also that Israel's circumstances make them feel like God is nowhere  
00:06:40.840 to be found and so the final words the book leave this tension totally unresolved it asks unless  
00:06:47.410 you've totally rejected us in the book ends the poet doesn't offer a nice neat conclusion much  
00:06:56.260 like our own experiences of pain and suffering the story of the Bible doesn't end here but this very  
00:07:02.230 important book shows us how lament and prayer and grief are a crucial part of the journey of faith  
00:07:08.590 of God's people in a broken world and that's what the Book of Lamentations is all about
