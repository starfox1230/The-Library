00:00:02.500 The book of the prophet Obadiah.
00:00:04.660 This is the shortest book in the whole Old Testament, it’s a mere 21 verses.
00:00:09.500 And at first glance, it does not look very promising.
00:00:12.160 It’s a series of divine judgement poems against the ancient people of Edom.
00:00:16.020 Which was a nation that neighbored Israel on the other side of the Dead Sea.
00:00:20.240 However, there is way way more going on here.
00:00:22.860 So first, here is the backstory.
00:00:25.100 The people of Edom were unique because they had a shared ancestry with the Israelites,
00:00:29.540 they both belonged to the family of Abraham,
00:00:32.240 who with Sarah, had their son Isaac,
00:00:35.180 who with his wife Rebekah, had two sons Jacob and Esau.
00:00:38.780 Now the book of Genesis told us the story of these two brothers
00:00:42.100 and to say the very least, they had a tense relationship.
00:00:44.960 They each later received the names Israel and Edom
00:00:48.200 which eventually became the name of the families that descended from them
00:00:52.000 and these families replayed the same difficult relationship of their ancestors.
00:00:56.400 Israel and Edom had enormous tensions throughout the centuries but they still shared that family bond.
00:01:02.340 And it’s that bond that was betrayed and shattered
00:01:05.440 in the tragic events of Jerusalem’s fall to Babylon.
00:01:08.860 So when Israel was invaded and conquered by Babylon,
00:01:11.700 the people of Edom took advantage by plundering other Israelite cities,
00:01:15.160 and then capturing, and even killing Israelite refugees.
00:01:19.200 Now in other prophetic books,
00:01:21.200 God held Israel’s neighbors accountable for this kind of violence
00:01:25.260 and so here Obadiah does the same for Edom.
00:01:27.960 The short book has two halves.
00:01:29.960 The first part is a series of accusations against the leaders of Edom,
00:01:33.120 specifically for their pride and self-exaltation.
00:01:36.640 Literally, as they lived up high in the desert rocks
00:01:40.080 but also metaphorically, they truly believed they were superior to the Israelites,
00:01:44.900 and it’s that pride that led the Edomites to not just stand idly by
00:01:49.400 when Babylon came to destroy Jerusalem but actually to participate in the destruction.
00:01:54.380 And so God says through Obadiah that Edom will be brought down from their height and destroyed.
00:02:00.360 As they have done to Israel, so it will be done to them.
00:02:04.480 Now right when you think you’re going to hear more about how Edom will meet its doom,
00:02:09.340 the topic suddenly shifts, in verse 15.
00:02:12.280 We hear this, “The day of the Lord is near against all nations.”
00:02:16.440 Now, why do we all of the sudden shift from Edom now to all nations?
00:02:20.120 This verse is a hinge piece and it links the first half of the book to the second half
00:02:25.560 where Obadiah announces the day of the Lord but not only for Edom,
00:02:29.360 he widens his focus to include all nations.
00:02:31.900 And Obadiah says that all prideful nations
00:02:35.020 that act like Edom will face God’s justice in the same way,
00:02:38.860 they’ll fall from their prideful heights and come to ruin.
00:02:42.540 Now the combination of these two sections,
00:02:44.240 one about Edom, the other one about all nations,
00:02:46.520 shows us why Obadiah was so interested in this tiny southern neighbor of Israel.
00:02:51.800 Obadiah sees Edom’s pride and fall as an example,
00:02:55.540 an image of how God will one day confront the pride of all nations and bring about their fall too.
00:03:02.060 It’s hardly coincidental that in Hebrew, the word Edom, or Edom,
00:03:06.200 is spelled with the exact same letters as the word humanity, or in Hebrew, Adam.
00:03:11.960 In Obadiah, Edom’s rise and fall is a parable
00:03:15.540 of how God’s justice will one day oppose pride and violence among all nations in the day of the Lord.
00:03:21.740 But as in all the prophets, God’s judgement is never his final word.
00:03:26.220 Specifically, remember the conclusion of the two books that came right before Obadiah, Joel and Amos.
00:03:32.040 Joel had painted a picture of what will happen after the day of the Lord against all nations.
00:03:36.860 He said that God would perform a new act of salvation in Jerusalem
00:03:41.040 and that all who humble themselves and call upon Him would be delivered
00:03:45.480 And in the conclusion of Amos, he said that after the day of the Lord has judged Israel’s evil,
00:03:50.660 God would raise up the house of David and build a new kingdom for Israel
00:03:55.100 that would include Edom and all the nations called by My name
00:03:58.940 And so the book of Obadiah has been placed right after Joel and then Amos
00:04:03.400 to expand on these very promises about the hope of God’s kingdom over all of the nations.
00:04:07.980 And so the book concludes with a very hopeful future.
00:04:11.320 God says that He’s going to restore His kingdom over the New Jerusalem
00:04:14.960 that He’ll repopulate it with a faithful remnant
00:04:18.760 God’s kingdom will expand to include all the territories and nations around Israel.
00:04:23.900 And so, this little book contributes to the larger portrait
00:04:27.820 of God’s justice and faithfulness that we’re seeing in the prophets.
00:04:31.700 The ancient pride and betrayal of the people of Edom
00:04:34.640 becomes an example of the greater human condition.
00:04:37.760 All of the ways that we betray and hurt each other, and God’s good world.
00:04:42.360 But there’s hope, Obadiah says.
00:04:44.520 Edom’s downfall points to the day when God will deal with the evil in our world
00:04:49.140 but also bring His healing kingdom of peace over all the nations
00:04:53.460 And that’s what the book of Obadiah is all about.
