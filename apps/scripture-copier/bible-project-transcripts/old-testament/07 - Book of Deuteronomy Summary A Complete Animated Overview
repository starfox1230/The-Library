# Book of Deuteronomy Summary: A Complete Animated Overview
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/q5QEH9bH8AU

00:00:03.040 The book of Deuteronomy is the fifth book of the Bible, and the final book of
00:00:06.970 the Torah. After the exodus from Egypt, Israel was at Mount Sinai for one year
00:00:11.690 entering into a covenant with their God. And then they had the disastrous
00:00:15.110 road trip through the wilderness and the exodus generation disqualified
00:00:19.050 themselves from entering into the land promised to Abraham. And so Deuteronomy
00:00:22.820 begins with Moses standing in front of this new generation explaining the Torah
00:00:28.210 and it's from here that the design and purpose of the book unfolds. Deuteronomy
00:00:32.390 is a series of speeches from Moses where he's calling the next generation of
00:00:36.320 Israel to be faithful to the covenant with their God.  At the center of the book
00:00:40.770 is a collection of laws, which are the terms of the covenant between God and
00:00:44.530 Israel. Some of the laws are new, but many are repeated from the laws given earlier
00:00:48.870 at Mount Sinai, and that's actually where this book gets its name -from the Greek
00:00:52.590 word “deuteronomion” which means “a second law”. Now surrounding these laws are two outer
00:00:58.800 sections of Moses’ speech. Each of these are broken up into two parts themselves.
00:01:02.730 Let’s just dive in and we'll see how this whole thing works. So Moses first of
00:01:06.500 all summarizes the story so far, and he highlights how rebellious the previous
00:01:10.510 generation was in contrast with God's constant grace and provision in the
00:01:15.260 wilderness and God did bring his justice on them,
00:01:17.830 yes, but he did not abandon his covenant promises. After this comes a series of
00:01:22.549 very passionate sermons where Moses calls on this new generation to be more
00:01:26.590 faithful than their parents were to the Covenant. He reminds them of the Ten
00:01:30.040 Commandments and then the centerpiece of the section is the famous line called
00:01:34.000 the Shema. Moses says “Listen Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord alone, and you
00:01:39.970 shall love the Lord your God with all of your heart, with all of your soul, and
00:01:44.140 with all of your might.” This became a very important daily prayer in Judaism
00:01:48.659 and it brings all of the themes of the book together. So the word “listen”, or shema
00:01:53.270 in Hebrew, it means much more than just to hear; its meaning includes responding
00:01:58.479 to what you hear, or in English we would say obey.  And the word “love” in Hebrew
00:02:02.850 also means much more than just an emotion or feeling; it’s about a decision
00:02:07.650 of wholehearted devotion to God that involves your will, and your emotions,
00:02:12.060 your mind and your heart. Now, for Israel their obedience and devotion to God
00:02:17.150 served a much larger purpose. Obedience to the laws is going to make Israel a
00:02:21.890 unique people among the nations, just like God said at Mount Sinai. They'll
00:02:25.620 become a kingdom of priests, and Moses now says how. Israel has the chance by
00:02:30.910 following the laws to show the whole world the wisdom and the justice of God.
00:02:35.270 The other key idea in the shema is that Israel was called to obey and be devoted to
00:02:39.980 the Lord alone, or literally in Hebrew it says “the Lord is one”. In context the point is
00:02:45.450 that the Lord is the one God Israel is to worship and obey. Israel's about to go
00:02:50.370 into the land of Canaan, where people worship idols gods that represent all
00:02:54.530 different aspects of creation: the sun, the weather, or sex and war. And in Moses’
00:02:59.730 view worshiping these God degrades humans and destroys communities, but worshipping
00:03:05.160 the God of Israel, who’s the Creator and the Redeemer- that will lead
00:03:09.110 to life and blessing. And so we come to the large collection of laws at the
00:03:13.580 center of the book and they're roughly arranged by topic, so the opening section
00:03:17.610 is about Israel's worship of their God. They were to have one central temple
00:03:21.160 where one God would be worshipped and also God was to be worshipped in
00:03:24.970 Israel's care for its poor. So for example, all Israelites were to set aside
00:03:29.040 one tenth of their annual income to be given to the temple, but another tenth was
00:03:34.260 to be set aside every three years and given to the poor. And these are the
00:03:37.850 kinds of laws that put Israel on the cutting edge of justice in comparison to
00:03:42.130 their ancient neighbors - and it was all bound up with their worship of God. The
00:03:46.640 next section outlines the character qualities of Israel's leaders so the
00:03:50.600 elders, the priests, the Kings, these were all placed under the authority of the
00:03:54.630 Covenant laws which God said that he would enforce by sending prophets to keep
00:03:59.360 the leaders accountable. So in contrast to Israel's neighbors where kings were
00:04:03.430 thought of as divine and a law in and of themselves
00:04:06.250 Israel's leaders were subordinate to the law and the prophets. Following this is a
00:04:10.930 large section of laws about Israel’s civil life, so rules about marriage, and family,
00:04:15.530 and business, and also about social justice - about their legal system and how
00:04:19.320 it was to protect widows,
00:04:20.738 and orphans, and immigrants. And then these are concluded by more laws about worship.
00:04:24.479 Now, here's some tips for reading all of these laws. Remember, first of all, these
00:04:28.860 are the terms of the Sinai covenant given specifically to ancient Israel
00:04:33.419 living in a culture that's very different from yours. And so, two, it's not
00:04:37.110 going to be helpful to compare these laws with modern laws from the very
00:04:41.020 different culture. Rather, these were given to set Israel apart, and so we need
00:04:45.750 to compare these laws with those of Israel's neighbors, like in Assyria or
00:04:49.940 Babylon. And when you do that all of a sudden laws that seemed harsh or bizarre
00:04:54.099 become much more clear. You see that God is pushing Israel to a higher level of
00:04:58.949 justice than was ever known before. And so finally try to discern what core
00:05:03.310 principles of wisdom or justice underlie any particular law, and you’ll discover some
00:05:08.599 really profound things. So here's an extra credit assignment: go see how
00:05:12.370 Paul the Apostle does this very thing in his first letter to the Corinthians,
00:05:15.690 chapter 9 vs nine, and he quotes a law from Deuteronomy, chapter 25 verse four,
00:05:21.460 It’s really interesting. So back to Moses - after he goes through all of the laws, he
00:05:25.919 issues a final challenge that Israel should listen to and love their God. He
00:05:30.380 first issues a warning and the ultimatum: if Israel listens to and obeys their God
00:05:35.449 everything's gonna go great- lots of divine blessing, but if they don't listen
00:05:39.580 and rebel…famine, plague, devastation, and ultimately exile from the land. And then
00:05:45.389 Moses forces a decision; he says: “Today I set before you all life or death,
00:05:50.639 blessing or curse, goodness or evil, so choose life by loving the Lord your God
00:05:56.969 and listening to him.” But then Moses says this, he says “I know that after I die
00:06:02.270 you're going to rebel and turn away from God and end up in exile.” Which is kind of
00:06:07.960 a downer, but then again, he's been with these people for decades and it becomes
00:06:11.729 clear that his hopes are not very high. But all is not lost, Moses says one day
00:06:17.330 when Israel is sitting in exile, at any point Moses says they can turn back to
00:06:22.469 their God who will, in his words, “circumcise your heart so that you may
00:06:26.680 love him with all your heart and soul
00:06:29.240 and live”. Now this is a vivid metaphor that's saying something is fundamentally wrong
00:06:33.270 with Israel's heart. It’s stubborn and hard, and it's the same thing wrong with
00:06:37.810 the heart of all of humanity.
00:06:39.680 This is going all the way back to the rebellion in the garden. Humans seized
00:06:43.169 autonomy from God; they wanted to define good and evil for themselves and they've
00:06:47.000 ruined God's good world as a result. But one day Moses says God is going to do
00:06:52.020 something to transform the hearts of his people so that they can truly listen
00:06:56.349 to and love God, from the heart, and be led back to true life. And this is the
00:07:01.470 promise that gets picked up by the later biblical prophets, Jeremiah and Ezekiel -
00:07:05.130 the hope for a new heart. So Moses ends his speech with a poem of warning, and
00:07:11.240 then a blessing, and then he walks up onto a mountain and he dies. And so the
00:07:16.520 torah draws to a close. All of the major plot tensions of the biblical story are
00:07:20.979 in place but left totally unresolved. So, when is the descendant of the woman
00:07:25.990 going to come in defeat evil? Or how is God going to rescue the whole world and
00:07:29.780 bless all nations through this family? And how can God's holiness be reconciled
00:07:34.630 with people who are continually rebellious? And how is God going to
00:07:38.190 transform the hearts of his people? You just have to keep reading to find out.
00:07:41.880 But for now, that’s what the book of Deuteronomy is all about.
