00:00:02.940 The book of Judges.
00:00:04.520 So remember after Joshua led the tribe of Israel into the Promised Land
00:00:08.520 he called them to be faithful to their covenant with God
00:00:11.540 by obeying the commands of the Torah.
00:00:13.540 And if they do this, they will show all the other nations what God is like.
00:00:17.380 So Judges begins with the death of Joshua
00:00:20.440 basically tells the story of Israel's total failure.
00:00:24.140 The book's name comes from the type of leaders Israel had in this period.
00:00:28.740 Before they had any Kings, the tribes were all governed by these "judges".
00:00:33.180 Now don't think of a courtroom.
00:00:35.520 These were regional, political, military leaders
00:00:38.580 more like a tribal chieftain.
00:00:41.020 And you need to be warned the book of Judges is very disturbing
00:00:44.180 and violent. It tells the tragic tale of Israel's moral corruption,
00:00:48.340 of its bad leadership,
00:00:49.940 and basically how they become no different than the Canaanites.
00:00:53.220 But this sad story is also meant to generate hope for the future,
00:00:57.360 and you can see this in how the book is designed.
00:00:59.860 There's a large introduction that sets the stage for Israel's failure
00:01:03.460 as they don't drive out the remaining Canaanites.
00:01:05.640 Then, the large main section of the book has stories about the growing corruption of Israel's judges.
00:01:11.900 And the progression here shows how Israel's leaders go from pretty good, to
00:01:14.880 ok, to bad,
00:01:16.740 to worse.
00:01:18.280 The concluding section is really disturbing
00:01:20.280 and shows the corruption of the people of Israel as a whole.
00:01:23.120 So let's dive in and we can explore each part a bit more.
00:01:26.500 The opening section begins with the tribes of Israel in their territories in the Promised Land,
00:01:31.100 and while Joshua defeated some key Canaanite towns,
00:01:34.700 there is still a lot of land to be taken,
00:01:37.000 and lots of Canaanites living in those areas.
00:01:39.540 And so chapter one gives a long list of Canaanite groups and towns
00:01:43.820 that Israel just failed to drive out from the land.
00:01:46.600 Now remember, the whole point of driving out the Canaanites
00:01:50.160 was to avoid their moral corruption and their way of worshiping the gods
00:01:54.960 through child sacrifice.
00:01:56.960 God had called Israel to be a holy people
00:01:59.540 and that does not happen.
00:02:01.760 Chapter 2 describes how Israel just moved in alongside the Canaanites
00:02:05.860 adopted all their cultural and religious practices.
00:02:09.039 and it's right here that the story stops.
00:02:12.280 For nearly a whole chapter, the narrator gives us an overview of everything that's about to happen
00:02:18.080 in the body of the book.
00:02:20.080 This part of Israel's history, the narrator says,
00:02:22.420 was a series of cycles moving in a downward spiral.
00:02:26.000 Israel became like the Canaanites,
00:02:28.260 and so they would sin against God.
00:02:30.460 So, God would allow them to be conquered and oppressed by the Canaanites,
00:02:33.840 and eventually the Israelites would see the error of their ways
00:02:37.040 and repent.
00:02:38.680 So God would raise up a deliverer of a judge from among Israel, who would defeat the enemy
00:02:42.980 and bring about an era of peace.
00:02:44.980 but eventually Israel would sin again and it will all start over.
00:02:49.160 This cycle provides the literary design and flow for the next main section of the book.
00:02:54.620 It gets repeated for each of the six main judges
00:02:57.560 whose stories are told here.
00:02:59.560 Now the stories of the first three judges
00:03:01.560 Othniel, Ehud and Deborah
00:03:05.200 they’re epic adventures - they're also extremely bloody stories.
00:03:09.820 Either the judge themselves or people who helped the judge -
00:03:13.160 they defeat their enemies and deliver the people of Israel.
00:03:16.820 The stories about the next three judges are longer
00:03:20.240 and they focus in on the character flaws of the judges
00:03:23.680 which get increasingly worse.
00:03:25.680 So Gideon, he begins pretty well, he's a coward of a man
00:03:29.180 but he eventually comes to trust that God CAN SAVE Israel through him
00:03:33.360 and so he defeats a HUGE army of Midianites with only three hundred men
00:03:37.660 carrying torches and clay pots.
00:03:40.840 But Gideon has a nasty temper and he murders a bunch of fellow Israelitas
00:03:45.640 for not helping him in his battle
00:03:47.700 and then it all goes downhill from there.
00:03:50.100 He makes an idol from the gold that he won in his battles
00:03:53.580 and then after he dies all Israel worships the idol as a god
00:03:57.420 and the cycle begins again.
00:04:00.600 The next main judge is Jephthah who's something of a mafia thug living up in the hills
00:04:05.320 and when things get really bad for Israel the elders come to him begging for his help.
00:04:09.620 And Jephthah was a very effective leader,
00:04:12.440 he won lots of battles against the Ammonites.
00:04:14.800 but he was so unfamiliar with the God of Israel he treats him like a Canaanite god -
00:04:19.940 he vows to sacrifice his daughter if he wins the battle.
00:04:23.620 This tragic story it shows just how far Israel has fallen,
00:04:28.780 they no longer know the character of their own God,
00:04:31.980 which leads to murder and to false worship.
00:04:35.180 The last judge Samson is by far the worst.
00:04:39.000 his life began full of promise, but he has no regard for the God of Israel.
00:04:44.140 He was promiscuous, violent and arrogant.
00:04:47.720 He did win brutally strategic victories over the Philistines
00:04:51.580 but only at the expense of his own integrity
00:04:54.220 and his life ends in a violent rush of mass murder.
00:04:58.640 Now a quick note here,
00:05:00.580 you´ll notice a repeated theme in the main section of the book
00:05:03.780 that at key moments God´s Spirit will empower each of these judges
00:05:07.800 to accomplish these great acts of deliverance.
00:05:11.140 Now the fact that God uses these really screwed up people
00:05:13.900 doesn´t mean he endorses all or even any of their decisions.
00:05:18.860 God is committed first and foremost to saving His people
00:05:22.260 but all he has to work with is these corrupt leaders
00:05:25.900 and so work with them he does.
00:05:28.340 This whole section is designed just to show how bad things have gotten -
00:05:31.800 you can´t even tell the Israelites and the Caananites apart anymore,
00:05:36.100 and that´s just the leaders.
00:05:38.360 The final section shows Israel as a whole hitting bottom.
00:05:41.760 There are two tragic stories here and they are not for the faint of heart.
00:05:46.220 They´re structured by this key line that gets repeated four times at the close of the book
00:05:51.760 In those days Israel had no king and everyone did what was right in their own eyes.
00:05:57.080 The first story is about an Israelite named Micah who built a private temple to an idol.
00:06:03.420 And that gets plundered by a private army sent by the tribe of Dan.
00:06:07.600 So they come and they steal everything and then they go and burn down the peaceful city of Laish
00:06:12.780 and murder all of its inhabitants, its a horrifying story.
00:06:17.120 When Israel forgets its God might makes right.
00:06:20.920 The final story of the book is even worse,
00:06:23.940 it's a shocking tale of sexual abuse and violence which all leads to Israel´s first civil war.
00:06:29.720 It's very disturbing and that´s the point.
00:06:33.540 These stories are meant to serve as a warning,
00:06:36.280 Israel´s descent into self destruction is a result of turning away
00:06:40.980 from the God who loves them and saved them out of slavery
00:06:44.680 in Egypt, and now Israel needs to be delivered again from themselves.
00:06:49.140 The only glimmer of hope in this story is found in this repeated line in the last part of the book.
00:06:54.600 It actually forms the last sentence of this story.
00:06:57.360 Israel has no king and so the stage is set for the following books to tell the origins of King David´s family,
00:07:05.460 the book of Ruth, and also the origins of kingship itself in Israel,
00:07:09.960 the book of 1 Samuel. But the story of Judges has value as a tragedy -
00:07:14.960 it's a sobering explanation of  the human condition, and ultimately it points out the need for God´s grace
00:07:22.120 to send a king who will rescue His people.
00:07:24.960 And that´s the book of judges.
