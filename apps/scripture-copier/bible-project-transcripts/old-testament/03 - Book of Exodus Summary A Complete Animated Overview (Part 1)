00:00:03.160 The book of Exodus. It's the second bookof the Bible and it picks up the storyline
00:00:07.720 from the previous book, Genesis,which ended with Abraham's grandson
00:00:11.320 Jacob leading his large family ofseventy people down to Egypt.
00:00:15.400 Now Jacob's eleventh son Joseph had beenelevated to second in command over Egypt
00:00:20.630 and he had saved his whole family in a  famine. And so Pharaoh the king of
00:00:23.910 Egypt offered the family to come livethere as a safe haven. And so eventually
00:00:28.779 Jacob dies there in Egypt and Joseph andall his brothers do too. About 400 years
00:00:34.720 pass and the story of the Exodusbegins. Now that name refers to the event
00:00:39.739 that takes place in the first half of the book--Israel's exodus from Egypt, but the book
00:00:44.649 has a second half that takes place atthe foot of Mount Sinai. In this video
00:00:48.969 we'll just focus on the first half, where centuries have passed and the Israelites
00:00:53.489 were fruitful and multiplied and theyfilled the land. Now this line is a
00:00:58.390 deliberate echo back to the blessingthat God gave all humanity back in the
00:01:02.739 Garden of Eden. And it reminds us of thebig biblical story so far.  Humanity
00:01:06.900 forfeited God's blessing through sin andrebellion and so God chose Abraham's
00:01:11.820 family as the vehicle through which hewould restore his blessing to all the
00:01:16.480 world. But the new Pharaoh does not viewIsrael as a blessing. He actually thinks
00:01:20.940 this growing Israelite immigrant group isa threat to his power. And so just as in
00:01:26.190 Genesis, humanity rebells against God'sblessing, so here
00:01:30.210 Pharaoh attempts to destroy the sourceof God's blessing, the Israelites. He
00:01:34.350 brutally enslaves them in forcedlabor and then he orders that all the
00:01:38.420 Israelite boys be drowned in the NileRiver. Now Pharaoh, he is the worst character
00:01:43.490 in the Bible so far. His kingdomepitomizes humanity's rebellion against
00:01:48.380 God. Pharaoh has so redefined good and evil according to his own interests that even
00:01:53.780 the murder of innocent children hasbecome good to him. And so Egypt has
00:01:58.610 become worse than Babylon from the book of Genesis and so now Israel cries out
00:02:03.470 for help against this new Babylon andGod responds.
00:02:07.120 God first turns Pharaoh's evil upside down, as an Israelite mother throws her boy
00:02:12.610 into the Nile River but in a basket. Andso he floats safely right down into
00:02:17.880 Pharaoh's own family. He's named Moses and he grows up to eventually become the man that
00:02:23.650 God will use to defeat Pharaoh's evil. In the famous story of the burning bush,  God appears to
00:02:29.450 Moses and commissions him to go toPharaoh and order him to release the
00:02:33.450 Israelites. And God says that he knowsPharaoh will resist and so he will bring
00:02:38.640 his judgment on Egypt in the form ofplagues. Then God also says that he will
00:02:43.990 harden Pharaoh's heart. And so we'reintroduced into the next main part of
00:02:48.680 the story--the confrontation between Godand Pharaoh.  Now what does this mean that
00:02:53.840 God says he will harden Pharaoh's heart? It's super important to read this section of
00:02:59.410 the story really closely in its sequence.In Moses and Pharaoh's first encounter
00:03:03.930 we're told simply that Pharaoh's heartgrew hard. There's no implication that
00:03:08.950 God did anything. And so in response Godsends the first set of 5 plagues, each
00:03:14.890 one confronting Pharaoh and one of hisEgyptian gods. And each time
00:03:19.660 Moses offers a chance for Pharaoh to humble himself and to let the Israelites go but
00:03:24.670 after each plague we're told that Pharaoheither hardened his heart or that his
00:03:29.070 heart grew hard. He's doing this of hisown will and so eventually it's with the
00:03:33.820 second set of 5 plagues that we begin tohear how God hardened Pharaoh's heart.  So the point
00:03:40.230 of the story seems to be this: eventhough God knew that Pharaoh would resist
00:03:44.380 his will, God still offered him allthese chances to do the right thing. But
00:03:49.100 eventually Pharaoh's evil reaches a pointof no return-- I mean even his own
00:03:53.370 advisers think that he has lost his mind.And it's at that point that God takes over
00:03:58.730 and bends Pharaoh's evil towards his ownredemptive purposes. God lures Pharaoh
00:04:03.950 into his own destruction as he saves hispeople, which is what happens next. With
00:04:08.660 the final plague, it's the night of Passover.And God turns the tables on Pharaoh. Just
00:04:13.769 as he killed the sons of the Israelites,so God will kill the first born in
00:04:18.540 Egypt with a final
00:04:19.738 plague. But unlike Pharaoh, God providesa means of escape through the blood of
00:04:25.680 the Lamb. And here the story stops andintroduces us in detail to the annual
00:04:31.030 Israelite ritual of Passover. On thenight before Israel left Egypt, they
00:04:35.410 sacrificed a young, spotless lamb andpainted its blood on the door frame of
00:04:39.740 their house. And when the divine plaguecame over Egypt, the houses covered
00:04:44.319 with the blood of the Lamb were passedover, and the son spared. And so every year
00:04:49.590 since, the Israelites have reenacted thatnight to remember and celebrate God's
00:04:54.610 justice and his mercy. But Pharaoh,because of his pride and rebellion, he
00:04:59.690 loses his own son and he's compelled tofinally let the Israelites go free. And
00:05:04.810 so the Israelite slaves make theirexodus from Egypt, but no sooner did they
00:05:08.979 leave than Pharaoh changes his mind and he gathers his army and chases after the
00:05:13.780 Israelites for a final showdown. As theIsraelites pass through the waters of
00:05:18.349 the sea safely, Pharaoh charges towardshis own destruction. The Exodus story
00:05:23.030 concludes with the first song of praisein the Bible. It's called the Song of the
00:05:27.020 Sea and the final line declares thatthe Lord reigns as king. And then the song
00:05:32.750 retells in poetry what the story ofGod's kingdom is all about. It's about how
00:05:37.349 God is on a mission to confront evil inhis world and to redeem those who are
00:05:42.139 enslaved to evil. God is going to bringhis people into the Promised Land where
00:05:47.030 his divine presence will live among them.This story is what it looks like when
00:05:52.139 God becomes king over his people. Soafter the Israelites sing their song, the
00:05:57.190 story takes a sharp turn.  The Israelites--they're trekking through the wilderness on
00:06:01.690 their way to Mount Sinai and they'rehungry, they're thirsty, and they start
00:06:05.069 criticizing Moses and God for even rescuing them. They say they long for the good old
00:06:11.020 days in Egypt. I mean, it's crazy. So Godgraciously provides food and water for
00:06:15.990 Israel in the wilderness, but thesestories, they cast a dark shadow and we
00:06:21.460 begin to wonder, "Could it be thatIsrael's heart is just as hard as
00:06:25.880 Pharaoh's?"  We shall see, but for now that's the first half of the book of Exodus.
