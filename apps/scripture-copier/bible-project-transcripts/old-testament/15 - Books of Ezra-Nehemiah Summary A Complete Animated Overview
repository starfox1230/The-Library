00:00:03.050 The books of Ezra and Nehemiah.
00:00:04.800 In most modern Bibles, these books are separate,
00:00:07.300 but that division happened long after it was written.
00:00:10.500 It was originally a unified work written by a single author
00:00:14.269 The story is set after the Babyloniansdestroyed Jerusalem and it's temple
00:00:18.500 and took many of the people into exile.
00:00:20.600 And this book picks up about 50 years later
00:00:23.500 and tells the return of some Israelites to Jerusalem
00:00:26.700 and then what happened when theyrebuilt the city and their lives there.
00:00:30.140 Specifically, the book focuses on 3key leaders who led the rebuilding efforts
00:00:33.770 You have Zerubbabel, then Ezra and then Nehemiah.
00:00:40.010 And the books' designfocuses on the efforts of each leader.
00:00:44.539 Zerubbabel leads a large group of people back to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple.
00:00:49.070 Then about 60 years later, Ezra arrives in Jerusalem to teach the Torah and rebuild the community,
00:00:51.790 and then he's followed by Nehemiah who leads the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls
00:00:57.199 And these three stories are designed to be parallel,
00:00:59.299 each begins with the king of Persia prompted by God to send the leader to Jerusalem
00:01:03.980 and He offers resources and support
00:01:06.400 and then each leader encounters opposition in their efforts
00:01:09.660 which they then overcome but in a way that leads to a strange anti-climax in each of the three parts.
00:01:16.540 Let's back up and see how it fits together.
00:01:18.660 So the story begins with a decree from Cyrus, the king of Persia,
00:01:21.920 and he's moved by God to allow the exiles to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple.
00:01:26.800 And the author says this fulfills a promise made by the prophet Jeremiah
00:01:31.200 that the exiles would one day return to Jerusalem.
00:01:34.370 Now this fulfillment should trigger ourhopes in the many other prophetic promises
00:01:39.620 that exile was not the end ofthe story.
00:01:42.200 We have hope for a future Messianic King from the line of David.
00:01:45.720 We have hope for a rebuilt temple where God's presence will dwell with His people.
00:01:50.020 Hope for God's kingdom to come over all the nations and bring His blessing just like He promised Abraham
00:01:56.000 And so it's with all these hopes in mind that we read on into the story of Zerubbabel.
00:02:01.610 His name means planted in Babylon.
00:02:04.430 He represents the generation born in Babylonian captivity
00:02:07.910 and he leads a wave of Israelites returning to Jerusalem.
00:02:11.300 After they settle there, they rebuild thealtar for offering sacrifices and later the temple itself.
00:02:16.360 The foundation laying ceremony and then the temple's final dedication- these are key moments.
00:02:21.280 The past stories of the tabernacle and temple's dedication should be in our minds,
00:02:26.160 this is when the fiery cloud of God's presence is supposed to descend.
00:02:30.460 He's dwelling with His people and itdoesn't happen.
00:02:33.740 And so while some people are happy about this new temple
00:02:37.150 the elders who had seen the previousTemple of Solomon they cry out in grief.
00:02:41.950 It is nothing like their glorious pastor their hopes for the future.
00:02:46.230 And its right here that we get the first story of opposition and it's very odd.
00:02:50.530 So the grandchildren of the Israelites,who were not taken into exile,
00:02:54.330 they had been living in Jerusalem all along,
00:02:56.340 they come to offer help with the temple rebuilding and Zerubbabel refuses.
00:03:01.390 He says you have no part in our temple and this of course generates a conflict
00:03:05.920 which Zerubbabel overcomes butit's very strange
00:03:08.740 because the prophets had envisioned that the tribes of Israel would all come together
00:03:13.740 along with all of the nations to participate in the worship of the God of israel
00:03:18.020 when the kingdom finally comes.
00:03:19.989 So this is an anti climactic moment tosay the least.
00:03:23.380 In the next section we zoom forwardabout 60 years and we're introduced to Ezra
00:03:27.040 he's a leader among the exiledIsraelites in Babylon and he's a Torah scholar and a teacher,
00:03:32.000 and so he gets appointed by Artaxerxes king of Persia to lead another wave of people back to Jerusalem
00:03:37.620 and Ezra wants to bring about spiritual and social renewal among the people.
00:03:42.140 Our hopes are high
00:03:43.460 and again we come to another anti climatic moment in the story.
00:03:47.739 Ezra learns that many of the exiled Israelites that had come back
00:03:52.660 they had married non exiles who had been living around Jerusalem.
00:03:56.440 Some of them were non-Israelites and almost certainly some of them were.
00:04:00.120 Ezra then appeals to the commands of the Torah
00:04:02.680 that Israel was supposed to be holy and separate from the ancient Canaanites.
00:04:06.720 And he then says that the people living around Jerusalem are like the Canaanites
00:04:11.060 they're going to corrupt the exiles.
00:04:13.100 So  Ezra offers a prayer of repentance and it's very heartfelt
00:04:16.519 but then he rallies all the leaders and enacts this divorce decree
00:04:20.560 that says all these marriages should be annulled, the women and children sent away.
00:04:24.940 And then the decree is only partially carried out when given a list of some of the men who divorce their wives.
00:04:31.509 The story is very strange for a number of reasons,
00:04:34.349 First of all, God never commanded Ezra to do any of this.
00:04:37.849 It was the leaders of Jerusalem who led Ezra to make the decree,
00:04:41.260 Second, the contemporary Prophet Malachi, he did say that the exile should care about purity
00:04:46.640 but he also said that God was opposed to divorce
00:04:50.120 and so the mixed results of thedecree this all fits into this pattern
00:04:54.610 of a strange concluding anti-climax
00:04:57.729 which leads us to the next section aboutNehemiah.
00:05:00.149 He's an Israelite official serving in the Persian government
00:05:03.309 and when he hears about the ruined state of Jerusalem's walls
00:05:07.330 he prays and then get permission from the Persian king Artaxerxes to go and rebuild the walls.
00:05:12.699 The King even gives them an armed escort and all these resources.
00:05:16.479 So after arriving in Jerusalem he begins the building project
00:05:19.480 and he too, faces opposition from the people who had already been living around Jerusalem.
00:05:24.669 Once again we face a tension in the story.
00:05:27.109 The contemporary Prophet Zechariah said
00:05:29.729 that the New Jerusalem of God's kingdom would be a city without walls.
00:05:33.430 That God's presence would surround it,
00:05:35.110 that people from all nations would come and join the covenant people.
00:05:38.470 But Nehemiah seems to operate with the opposite vision.
00:05:41.889 He informs the people surrounding Jerusalem that they have no part in Jerusalem.
00:05:46.120 And this of course provokesthem to hostility and so well
00:05:49.930 Nehemiah carries out his vision for thecity with integrity and courage.
00:05:53.949 They have to build the city with armedguards to protect them.
00:05:57.129 We keep wondering, could this wholeconflict have been handled differently?
00:06:01.560 And this all leads to the conclusion ofthe book in two movements.
00:06:04.560 First positive and then negative.
00:06:06.729 Ezra and Nehemiah combine forces to bring about a spiritual renewal among the people.
00:06:11.050 They gather all the exiles together fora festival,
00:06:14.190 they read and teach the Torah to all the people for 7 days,
00:06:17.970 and then they celebrate the ancient feast of tabernacles
00:06:20.910 to remember God's faithfulness from the exodus and the wilderness journeys.
00:06:24.550 Then they offer a confession of theirsins,
00:06:26.750 they vow themselves to renew the Covenant, follow all the commands of the Torah
00:06:31.080 and they finished with the great celebration over the temple, the walls of Jerusalem.
00:06:36.139 And we're thinking this could be theturning point but it's not.
00:06:40.240 The book ends on a huge downer.
00:06:43.099 Nehemiah tours around the city and he finds that the people have not been fulfilling their covenant vows.
00:06:48.919 So Zerubbabel's work is undone as hefinds the temple being neglected
00:06:53.120 and staffed by all these unqualified people.
00:06:55.939 He then discovers that Ezra's work is being compromised
00:06:59.569 he finds everyone violating the Torah,people are working on the Sabbath
00:07:03.209 and even his own work on the walls isinvolved
00:07:06.169 because people are setting up markets around the walls of Jerusalem and working on the Sabbath.
00:07:11.140 So Nehemiah, he goes on a rampage,
00:07:13.220 he is beating people up, he's pulling out their hair and he's yelling,
00:07:17.180 "Obey the commands of the Torah!"
00:07:19.140 In his final words are a prayer that God would remember him that at least he tried and the book ends.
00:07:26.260 I mean it's very strangebut we've been prepared for it, right?
00:07:30.139 These anti climactic moments have been woven into the book's design intentionally.
00:07:35.270 And so, it raises the question what on earth does this book contribute to the storyline of the Bible?
00:07:40.940 Well, remember the book started by raising our hopes
00:07:43.760 and the prophetic promises about the Messiah, the temple, the kingdom of God,
00:07:47.620 and then none of it happens.
00:07:50.150 So even though Israel is now back in the land,
00:07:52.750 their spiritual state seems unchanged from before the exile.
00:07:56.760 And while Ezra, Nehemiah, they do their best
00:07:59.100 but their political and social reforms among the people don't address the core issues of their heart.
00:08:05.659 so what the book is pointing out is the same need highlighted by the  prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel.
00:08:11.580 What God's people need is a holistic transformation of their hearts.
00:08:16.430 If they're ever going to love and obeytheir God.
00:08:19.370 And so the book ends on a downer,
00:08:21.230 yes but it forces you to keep reading on into the wisdom and prophetic books to find out
00:08:26.920 what is God going to do to fulfill his great covenant promises.
00:08:30.920 But for now that's the book of Ezra-Nehemiah.
