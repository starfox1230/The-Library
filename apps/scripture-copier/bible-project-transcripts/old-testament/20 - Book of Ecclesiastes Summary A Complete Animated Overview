# https://www.youtube.com/watch/lrsQ1tc-2wk

00:00:02.660 the book of ecclesiastes it's part of the Bible's wisdom literature and it opens with this line  
00:00:08.180 the words of qohelet the son of David King in Jerusalem now in Hebrew the word qohelet means  
00:00:15.290 someone who has gathered people together and in this case it's to learn so it's often translated  
00:00:20.750 in English as teacher and the teacher is said to be a son or a descendant of King David and  
00:00:26.480 so there are different views about who this figure might have been many think that it refers to King  
00:00:31.160 Solomon others - maybe one of the later kings of David's line and still others think that it's  
00:00:37.070 actually a later Israelite teacher who has adopted a Solomon like persona as a teaching aid whichever  
00:00:43.700 of these views is correct the key thing is to recognize that the teacher is a character in the  
00:00:48.890 book and is different than the author of the book who remains anonymous so we do hear the teacher's  
00:00:55.520 voice for most of the book but it's actually a different voice the author who introduces us to  
00:01:01.430 the teacher in the first sentence and then at the end concludes the book by summarizing and  
00:01:06.260 evaluating everything the teacher just said so the author is someone who wants us to hear all that  
00:01:12.020 the teacher has to say and then help us process it and form our own conclusion so what does the  
00:01:17.480 teacher have to say well the author summarizes the teachers basic message at the beginning and right  
00:01:22.940 at the end and it's heavily heavily everything is utterly Hevel now most English Bibles translate  
00:01:30.650 this word have alas meaningless but that doesn't quite capture the heart of the idea in Hebrew  
00:01:36.800 Hevel literally means vapor or smoke and the teacher uses this word thirty-eight times in  
00:01:43.130 the book as a metaphor to describe how life is first of all temporary or fleeting like a wisp  
00:01:48.920 of smoke but secondly also how life is an enigma or a paradox like smoke it appears solid but when  
00:01:57.440 you try and grab on to it there's nothing there so there's so much beauty or goodness  
00:02:02.750 in the world but just when you're enjoying it tragedy strikes and it all seems to blow away  
00:02:08.539 or we all have a strong sense of justice but all the time bad things happen to good people so life  
00:02:15.290 is constantly it's unpredictable it's unstable or in the teachers words like chasing after the  
00:02:20.750 wind Hevel now that's kind of a downer so why is he saying all of this the author's basic goal is  
00:02:27.710 to target all of the ways that we try to build meaning and purpose in our lives apart from God  
00:02:33.590 and he lets the teacher deconstruct these so the author thinks we spend most of our time investing  
00:02:38.930 energy and emotion in things that ultimately have no lasting meaning or significance and he lets the  
00:02:44.540 teacher give us a hard lesson in reality you can see this most clearly in the opening and closing  
00:02:49.850 poems which focus first of all on time and then on death so the teacher says you can spend your  
00:02:56.150 whole life working and achieving because you think that makes your life meaningful you should really  
00:03:01.010 stop and consider the march of time for all of the human effort that takes place in the world  
00:03:05.930 nothing really ever changes so short we develop technology and we build nations that rise and  
00:03:12.740 fall but go climb a mountain and see if it cares it was there long before any of us and it will  
00:03:19.280 be here long after I mean no one's even going to remember you or anything you did 100 years  
00:03:24.620 from now but that mountain it'll still be there and the ocean will still be breaking on the beach  
00:03:29.810 and the Sun will still rise and set and so time will eventually erase you and me and everything  
00:03:36.980 that we care about and if that's not disheartening enough the teacher also can't stop talking about  
00:03:42.530 death all the way through the book but especially in this poem near the end he says death is the  
00:03:47.750 great equalizer and it renders meaningless most of our daily activities it devours the wise and  
00:03:54.260 the fool the rich and the poor no matter who you are what you've done good or bad we're all going  
00:04:00.650 to die and it's inescapable so with these two ideas in hand the teacher goes on to consider  
00:04:06.530 all the activities and false hopes that we invest our lives in to find meaning and significance like  
00:04:12.080 wealth or career or social status or pleasure so you think working hard is going to make life  
00:04:19.100 worth it think about the stress and the toll that that takes on you all the anxiety and the  
00:04:24.710 sleepless nights and by the time you actually earn some wealth you're going to be too old to enjoy  
00:04:30.140 anyway and then by the time that you have to pass it on to someone they may not even be someone who  
00:04:35.180 cares about anything that you did or maybe you think pleasure is going to make life worth it for  
00:04:39.920 you go for it you know live for your vacations live for the weekend party Monday always comes  
00:04:47.270 Hevel Hevel everything is utterly Hevel so what does the teacher advocate then that we become  
00:04:54.350 pure hedonist or relativists well no that would be level two the teacher acknowledges the ideas from  
00:05:00.530 Proverbs that living by wisdom and the fear of the Lord that these have real advantages on the whole  
00:05:05.780 life will probably go better for you see but the problem is that even living by wisdom and the fear  
00:05:11.630 of the Lord they're heavily too because they don't guarantee a good life good people die tragically  
00:05:18.320 and horrible people live long and prosper there's just too many exceptions and so even wisdom is a  
00:05:24.410 Hethel again not meaningless but an enigma wisdom doesn't work the way you think it should all of  
00:05:30.920 the time so what's the way forward in the midst of all this Hevel and here paradoxically the  
00:05:36.290 teacher discovers the key to the true enjoyment of life under the Sun it's accepting Hethel it's  
00:05:43.730 acknowledging that everything in your life is totally out of your control about six different  
00:05:49.070 times at some of the bleakest moments in his monologue the teacher talks about the gift of  
00:05:54.350 God which is the enjoyment of simple good things in life like friendship or family a good meal or a  
00:06:03.080 sunny day you can't control these things you're certainly not guaranteed them but that's their  
00:06:08.750 beauty when I come to adopt a posture of total trust in God it frees me to simply enjoy my life  
00:06:16.340 as I actually experience it not as I think it ought to be because even my expectations about  
00:06:23.240 what life ought to be are ultimately Hevel Hevel everything under the Sun is utterly Hevel and so  
00:06:31.700 the teachers words come to a close right here at the end the author speaks up again and he brings  
00:06:36.380 it all to a conclusion he says the teachers words are very important for us to hear he likens them  
00:06:42.080 to a shepherd staff with a goad a pointy end which might hurt when it pokes you but he says  
00:06:49.140 the teacher is trying to poke you to get you to move in the right direction towards greater wisdom  
00:06:54.270 the author then warns us that you can actually take the teachers words too far and you could  
00:06:59.970 spend your whole life buried in books trying to answer life's existential puzzles don't try he  
00:07:06.420 says you'll never get there and so instead the author offers his own conclusion and it's this  
00:07:11.340 fear God and keep his Commandments this is the whole duty of humans for God will bring every  
00:07:17.880 deed into judgment every hidden thing whether good or evil and so the author thinks it's good  
00:07:25.620 to let the teacher challenge your false hopes and remind you that time and death make most of life  
00:07:31.920 completely out of your control but what gives life true meaning is the hope of God's judgment  
00:07:38.760 the hope that one day God will clear away all of the Hevel and bring true justice to our world and  
00:07:45.330 it's that hope that should fuel a life of honesty and integrity before God despite the fact that I  
00:07:52.260 remain puzzled by most of life's mysteries and that's the wisdom of the book of Ecclesiastes
