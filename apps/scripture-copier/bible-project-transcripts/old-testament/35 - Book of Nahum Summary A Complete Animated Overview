00:00:02.940 The book of the prophet Nahum
00:00:06.070 This short prophetic book is a collectionof poems announcing the downfall of one
00:00:10.360 of Israel's worst oppressors, the ancientempire of Assyria and its capital city Nineveh.
00:00:16.000 The Assyrians arose as one of theworld's first great empires.
00:00:19.970 And their expansion into Israel resulted in thetotal destruction and exile of the
00:00:24.279 northern kingdom and its tribes.
00:00:26.200 The Assyrian armies were violent and destructive on a scale that the world had never seen before.
00:00:31.560 And so Israel and its neighbors wereawaiting the downfall of Assyria,
00:00:35.500 which eventually came in the year 612 BC.
00:00:38.460 The Babylonians rose up andbegan a rebellion that overtook Nineveh
00:00:42.020 and brought down the Assyrian Empire.
00:00:44.720 And so chapter 2 depicts thefall of Nineveh in vivid poetry.
00:00:48.160 And chapter 3 then explores thedownfall of the empire as a whole.
00:00:52.340 But, this book isn't just an angrytirade against Israel's enemies.
00:00:57.640 The introductory chapter shows us that thereis way, way more going on here.
00:01:01.520 The book opens with an incompletealphabet poem that begin by describing
00:01:06.380 a powerful appearance of God's glory.
00:01:08.900 It's very similar to how the previous book, Micah, beginand how the next book, Habakkuk, is going to conclude.
00:01:15.320 And it's God, the all-powerful Creator, coming toconfront the nations and bring His justice on their evil.
00:01:21.420 And the poem opens by quoting fromthe famous line of God's self-description
00:01:26.200 after the golden calf incident,in the book of Exodus chapter 34,
00:01:29.920 "The Lord is slow to anger, He's great in power,He won't leave evil unpunished."
00:01:35.540 And so the rest of the poem goes back and forth,
00:01:37.800 contrasting the fate of the arrogant violentnations with the fate of God's faithful remnant.
00:01:43.620 When God brings down all the arrogant empires,
00:01:46.000 He will provide refuge for thosewho humble themselves before Him.
00:01:49.760 Now here's what's really interesting.
00:01:51.800 Is that you thought this book was only about Assyria
00:01:55.300 but Nahum actually nowhere mentions Nineveh or Assyria in chapter 1.
00:01:59.940 And when he describesthe downfall of the bad guys,
00:02:02.539 he uses Isaiah's language about the fall of Babylon
00:02:06.280 (which happened much later in history).
00:02:08.199 And not only that, Nahum alsodescribes the downfall of the bad guys
00:02:12.060 as good news forthe remnant of God's people.
00:02:15.500 It's a direct allusion to Isaiah's good news about the downfall of Babylon.
00:02:19.660 And so all these little details from Chapter 1,they come together to make a key point:
00:02:23.860 for Nahum, the fall of Ninevehis being presented as an example.
00:02:28.580 As an image of how God is at workin history in every age.
00:02:32.560 How He won't allow the arrogant orviolent empires of our world to endure forever.
00:02:38.160 So the message of Nahum isactually very similar to that of Daniel.
00:02:41.540 Assyria stands in a long line ofviolent empires throughout history.
00:02:46.700 And Nineveh's fate is a memorial to God's commitmentto bring down the violent and the arrogant in every age.
00:02:54.000 With this perspectivefrom the opening chapter,
00:02:56.040 the book then returns to its focus on Assyria.
00:02:58.700 And so chapter 2 describes the Battle of Ninevehand the overthrow of the city in progressive stages.
00:03:03.800 So first, we see the front line ofBabylonian soldiers.
00:03:07.000 And then we read about the charge of the chariots.
00:03:09.400 And then the chaos on the city wallsas the city is breached.
00:03:12.800 Then the slaughter of Nineveh's people.Then the plundering of the city.
00:03:16.300 Chapter 3 goes on to describe the resultsof the city's downfall for the empire as a whole.
00:03:21.700 So Nahum begins by announcing a woe upon the city
00:03:25.200 whose kings built it withthe blood of the innocent.
00:03:28.300 It's an image of how injustice was built intothe very system that made Assyria so successful.
00:03:34.280 But their violence has sown the seeds of their own destruction, and so Assyria will fall before Babylon.
00:03:40.940 The book concludes with a tauntagainst the fallen king of Assyria.
00:03:44.800 He's stricken with a fatal wound.
00:03:46.920 And from among all the nations, that he onceoppressed, no one comes to help him.
00:03:51.800 Rather they sing and celebrate his destruction.
00:03:55.420 And that's how the book ends.
00:03:58.020 Now this is a gloomy book.
00:04:00.000 But it's important to seehow Nahum's message addresses
00:04:03.540 the tragic and perpetual cyclesof human violence and oppression in every age.
00:04:08.200 Human history is filled with tribesand nations elevating themselves
00:04:13.500 and using violence to take what they want,resulting in the death of the innocent.
00:04:18.040 And the book of Nahum uses Assyriaand Babylon as examples
00:04:21.720 to tell us that God is grieved.
00:04:24.100 And that He cares about the death of the innocent.
00:04:26.440 And that His goodness and His justice compel Himto orchestrate the downfall of oppressive nations.
00:04:32.380 And God's judgment on evilis good news.
00:04:35.780 Unless, of course, you happen to be Assyria.
00:04:38.400 Which brings us all the way back to theconclusion of that opening poem in chapter 1.
00:04:42.700 Which tells us that,
00:04:43.700 "The Lord is good and a refuge in the day of distress. He cares for those who take refuge in Him."
00:04:50.300 And so the little book of Nahuminvites every reader
00:04:53.340 to humble themselves before God's justice.
00:04:56.000 And to trust that, in His time, He will bringdown the oppressors of every time and place.
00:05:02.120 And that's what the book ofNahum is all about.
