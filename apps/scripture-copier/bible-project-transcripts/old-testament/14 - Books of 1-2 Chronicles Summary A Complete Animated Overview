00:00:03.160 The books of 1 and 2 Chronicles.While they're two separate books in our
00:00:07.390 Bibles that division is not original. Dueto scroll lengths the book was divided
00:00:11.799 in two but it was written as one book withone coherent storyline.  Now in our
00:00:16.360 English Bibles, Chronicles comes afterthe books of Samuel and kings and most
00:00:20.920 of Chronicles is actually repeat contentfrom those books and so most modern
00:00:25.119 readers when they come to Chroniclesthey think, "Wait a minute, I just read all of this!"
00:00:29.100 and so they skip it, and that's ashame because this book is really unique
00:00:32.980 and important in the Bible. In thetraditional Jewish ordering of the Bible,
00:00:37.120 Chronicles is actually the last book,because it summarizes all of the Jewish Scriptures.
00:00:42.200 The first word in the book is Adam,the first character at the beginning of the story,
00:00:46.200 and then the lastparagraph announces the return of Israel from exile.
00:00:51.100 Now we don't know, who wrote this book,but we can tell from details within it.
00:00:55.270 It was produced by somebody, who lived a couple hundred years after the
00:00:58.930 Israelites returned from the Babylonianexile. Now for this author, Jerusalem and
00:01:03.460 the temple were rebuilt some time ago,and as we learned for Ezra & Nehemiah,
00:01:07.210 things were not going well.
00:01:09.610 The great prophetic hope was that thecity and the temple would be rebuilt,
00:01:13.540 that God would come to live among hispeople, the Messianic King would come and
00:01:17.590 all the nations would come live underhis peaceful rule, and none of that has happened.
00:01:22.100 And so, the author of Chronicles has reshaped these stories of David and Solomon
00:01:27.100 and the Kings of the past inorder to provide a message of hope for the future.
00:01:31.820 And we'll see that he's designed this book to emphasize two clear themes:
00:01:35.980 First - the hope of the coming Messianic King
00:01:38.240 and second - the hope for a new temple.
00:01:40.800 Let's just dive in and you'll see thesethemes all over the book
00:01:43.860 1 Chronicles begins with nine chapters of genealogies- long list of names,
00:01:49.040 and you'll read these and think that this is kind of boring,
00:01:51.760 and that may be true for you, but actuallythey're very, very important.
00:01:55.600 The author is summarizing herethe whole storyline of the Old Testament
00:01:59.100 by naming all of the key characters in the stories.
00:02:02.410 And as he does so, he shapes the genealogies to emphasize two key lineages.
00:02:07.910 First is a line of the promised Messianic King.
00:02:10.199 So lots of space is dedicated to tracing the line of Judah that led all the way to King David
00:02:14.680 to whom the Messianic promise was given.
00:02:16.740 And then from David the author traces that line up into his own day.
00:02:20.879 The other family line that receives lotsof attention here is that of the priesthood,
00:02:24.900 the descendants of Aaron,who of course served in the temple.
00:02:28.100 and so, right from the start,you can see the two main themes.
00:02:31.799 The author's hope of the Messiah coming to build a new temple and it's rooted in these ancient genealogies.
00:02:38.200 Now after that, the author moves intothe stories about David,
00:02:41.100 and most of these are going to befamiliar to you from the book of Samuel
00:02:44.400 but again there's some really important differences.
00:02:47.140 So first of all the author leaves out all of the negative stories about David,
00:02:51.280 where he's portrayed as weak or immoral,
00:02:53.819 so Saul chasing David around the desertand persecuting him,
00:02:57.300 the story of David's adultery with Bathshebaand then murdering her husband,
00:03:01.709 all of that is gone, and what's left arethe stories that portray David as a good guy.
00:03:06.500 And not only that. There's also newadditional material that you won't find
00:03:10.769 in the book of Samuel, that shows Davidin a very positive light,
00:03:14.549 so there's a large block of chapters,where David makes preparations for the temple.
00:03:18.560 He arranged his resources and buildersand Levites and choirs.
00:03:22.340 And not only that. The author also portrays Davidas a Moses like figure.
00:03:27.460 God gives David plans for building the Temple,
00:03:30.020 just as he gave plans to Mosesfor building the tabernacle.
00:03:33.419 So why all this new material about David?
00:03:35.820 The author's not trying to hide David's flaws.
00:03:38.840 He knows that anybody can go read about themin the book of Samuel.
00:03:41.560 Rather, he's trying to portray David as the ideal king in order to make him an image or a type
00:03:47.600 of the future Messiah from the line of David.It's very similar to how
00:03:51.509 Jeremiah or Ezekiel spoke of the coming Messiahas a new David.
00:03:56.100 This is most clear and how the author retells thestory of God's covenant promise to David
00:04:00.209 in 1 Chronicles 17. When you compare the story withits parallel, in 2 Samuel 7,
00:04:05.970 You'll see that the author of Chroniclesis highlighting that neither David nor Solomon,
00:04:10.049 nor any of the Kings from his linewere the Messianic King,
00:04:14.300 and that when the Messiah does come,He will be a king like David.
00:04:18.300 And so for this author,these stories about David from the past
00:04:22.300 are what sustained his hope for the future.
00:04:24.900 After David dies, we move into 2 Chronicles,which focuses on the kings that lived in Jerusalem.
00:04:30.500 And again, there's lots of overlap with 1 and 2 Kings,but there are many key differences.
00:04:35.610 So the author has left out all of thestories about the kings of northern Israel,
00:04:39.300 so he can just focus on the lineof David. And there's lots of new
00:04:42.930 material about these kings from David's line.He highlights the kings that were
00:04:47.130 obedient to God and he adds new stories about how their obedience led to success in God's blessing.
00:04:52.900 But he also adds new stories about kings whowere unfaithful to God.
00:04:57.000 They didn't follow the Torah,they led Israel to worship idols,
00:04:59.900 and these kings face horrible consequences,all leading up to Israel's exile,
00:05:05.500 a mess of their own making.
00:05:07.320 And so, this whole section becomes aseries of character studies,
00:05:09.900 where the author wants later generations of Israelitesto learn from their family history,
00:05:15.000 and so become faithful to their God and the Torah.
00:05:18.960 Now the book's conclusion is really unique, too.At the very end of the book,
00:05:22.620 the king of the Persians, his name'sCyrus, and he tells the Israelites that
00:05:26.910 they can go back home, return from exile,rebuild the city and the temple.
00:05:31.100 And he says (last line of the book) :
00:05:33.300 "... whoever there is among you, of all his people,may the Lord his God be with him and let him go up..."
00:05:40.000 and that's how the book ends,with an incomplete sentence!
00:05:43.140 Now of course,the author knows about the first return from exile and
00:05:46.500 the stories of Ezra and Nehemiah,but clearly in his view, the prophetic hopes of Israel
00:05:51.700 were not fulfilled in those events.And so, this incomplete ending shows that
00:05:56.200 the author's hope is set on yet another return from exile,
00:05:59.900 when the Messiah will finally cometo rebuild the temple and restore God's people.
00:06:05.200 And so, the Book of Chronicles, the final book of the Jewish Scriptures, it ends by pointing forward.
00:06:11.000 It calls God's people to look back in order to look ahead,
00:06:14.190 because the past has become the source of hopefor the future.
00:06:18.480 So, Chronicles concludes the OldTestament as a story in search of an ending,
00:06:22.800 and that's what this book is all about.
