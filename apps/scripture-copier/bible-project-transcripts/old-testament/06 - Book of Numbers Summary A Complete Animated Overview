00:00:03.010 The Book of Numbers. This fourth book of the Bible carries forward the story of
00:00:06.910 Israel after their exodus from slaveryin Egypt. God had brought them to Mount
00:00:10.860 Sinai and He entered into a covenant with them there, and despite Israel's rebellion,
00:00:15.980 God had graciously provided a way forIsrael to live near his holy presence in
00:00:20.750 the tabernacle. So the Book of Numbersbegins as Israel wraps up their one-year
00:00:25.440 stay at Mount Sinai and they head outinto the wilderness on their way to the
00:00:30.090 land that God promised to Abraham. Now the book's storyline is designed
00:00:33.840 according to the stages of their journey. So the first section begins at Mount
00:00:38.100 Sinai, but then they set out in travel tothe wilderness of Paran. And then from
00:00:43.249 there they travel to the plains of Moab,which is right across from the promised
00:00:48.179 land. Now the first part opens with acensus where the people are numbered.
00:00:52.889 That's where the book gets its name. Andthen there are laws about how the tribes
00:00:56.429 of Israel were to be arranged in theircamp. So the tabernacle was to be at the
00:01:00.579 center, and then around that the priestsand the Levites, and then around them
00:01:04.580 the twelve tribes neatly arranged withJudah at their head. Now this was all an
00:01:09.550 elaborate symbol about how God's holypresence was at the center of their
00:01:13.790 existence as a people. This is allfollowed by a whole series of laws that
00:01:17.810 developed the purity laws from the bookof Leviticus. If God's presence was going
00:01:22.040 to be in their midst, every effort shouldbe made to make the camp pure--a place
00:01:26.950 that welcomes God's holiness. In chapter10, the cloud of God's presence lifts
00:01:31.840 from the tabernacle and guides Israelaway from Sinai out into the wilderness
00:01:35.950 and immediately things go terribly wrong.So in chapter 11 the people start
00:01:41.440 complaining about their hunger andthirst and how they want to go back to
00:01:45.160 Egypt. And then in chapter 12, Moses'sown brother and sister began opposing
00:01:50.400 and bad-mouthing him in front of all ofthe people. This trip is not off to a
00:01:54.790 good start. The next section begins asthe Israelites arrived in the desert of
00:01:58.990 Paran--about halfway to the promisedland. And God tells Moses to send out the
00:02:03.380 twelve spies, one for each tribe, so theycan scout out the Promised Land. So when
00:02:08.209 the spies all return, ten of them saythat there is no chance Israel can
00:02:12.780 survive there because the Canaaniteswill destroy them.
00:02:15.580 But there are two spies, Caleb and Joshua, who say that God can save them but the
00:02:20.820 10 whip up the people into a fearfulrage and they start planning a mutiny!
00:02:25.240 They're going to appoint a new leaderand head back to Egypt. So God is
00:02:29.000 understandably angry and Moses intercedes on the people's behalf. He calls
00:02:33.930 God to be faithful to His promises toAbraham. And so God does, but not at the
00:02:39.100 expense of his justice. He gives theseIsraelites what they want--to not enter
00:02:43.890 the land. And God sentences thisgeneration to wander in the wilderness
00:02:47.500 for forty years until they die.
00:02:50.130 Only their children will get to enter thePromised Land. Now you'd think this severe
00:02:54.810 consequence would wake them up, but itgets even worse. So, in the next story
00:02:58.740 there's a whole group of Levites thatbegan a rebellion and they challenged
00:03:02.580 Moses and Aaron's leadership, saying that they have gone way too far. So God deals
00:03:07.890 severely with these Levites and he renewshis commitment to Moses and Aaron as
00:03:12.810 Israel's leaders. Now as they leave theregion of Paran and hit the road, it goes
00:03:17.300 downhill yet again. The Israelites startcomplaining again about their thirst and
00:03:22.180 they ask why Moses even brought them out of Egypt in the first place. So God tells
00:03:26.570 Moses to speak to a rock, to bring outwater for all of the people. But Moses
00:03:31.370 doesn't really do this. He overstepshis bounds. He hits the rock twice and
00:03:36.110 then says, "You rebels! Do we have to bring water out of this rock?" So Moses
00:03:40.420 dishonors God by putting himself inGod's place as the one who brings out
00:03:44.880 the water. And so Moses brings down onhimself the same fate as the wilderness
00:03:50.000 generation. He too will die in the desertand never get to enter the Promised Land.
00:03:54.360 After this the Israelites rebel yetagain and God brings a very strange
00:03:59.420 judgment on them.
00:04:00.970 Venomous snakes to come and bite the people. And so Moses again
00:04:04.980 intercedes on behalf of the people andGod tells Moses to do this: to make a
00:04:09.050 bronze snake and lift it up on a poleso that whoever looks at this snake
00:04:14.459 would be healed of the poisonous snakebite. It's a very strange symbol, but it speaks
00:04:19.880 to the challenge that God has by beingfaithful to His covenant. He's right to
00:04:25.060 bring justice on the Israelites' evil.
00:04:27.540 But even God's justice gets transformedinto a source of life for those who will
00:04:33.570 look to God for healing. From here thepeople head into the plains of Moab.
00:04:38.130 The first main part of this sectionfocuses on the strange figure of Balaam.
00:04:41.850 So the king of Moab is freaked outat this huge group of people traveling
00:04:46.140 through his territory, so he hires apagan sorcerer, Balaam, to pronounce curses
00:04:51.360 on Israel. And three different times
00:04:54.280 Balaam finds that he cannot curse them.He can utter only blessing upon Israel.
00:04:59.290 Remember God's promise to Abraham from Genesis 12. So not only can Balaam not
00:05:03.280 curse Israel, but God actually gives hima vision about a future Israelite king
00:05:08.450 who will one day bring God's justice toall of the nations. This vision recalls
00:05:12.780 Jacob's promise to Judah in Genesis chapter49. Now it's worth stopping to reflect on
00:05:18.010 the flow of the book so far. Therebellion stories in the wilderness, they
00:05:22.120 just heap up on one another, gettingworse and worse. And while God does bring
00:05:27.040 partial acts of judgment on Israel, he'salso kept showing mercy, providing food
00:05:31.970 and water along the way. And so theBalaam story, it shows God's grace in
00:05:36.820 bright colors because here's Israel--they're down on the camp grumbling and
00:05:41.020 rebelling--but up in the hills,unbeknownst to them,
00:05:44.520 God is protecting and even blessing them.And it's this contrast between Israel's
00:05:49.570 rebellion and God's faithfulness in thewilderness that has made these
00:05:53.280 stories so important for latergenerations of Israel. So the wilderness
00:05:57.710 stories are retold time and again bylater biblical prophets and poets and
00:06:03.190 even by the apostles in the NewTestament. And these stories always serve
00:06:06.790 as a warning that while God will remainfaithful to His covenant promises, he
00:06:11.990 will also allow his people to walk awayin rebellion and face the consequences.
00:06:17.150 After this, the rest of the book focuseson the children of the wilderness
00:06:21.050 generation and they begin preparing toinherit the promised land. They take
00:06:25.120 another census of the new generation,then they go on and win a number of
00:06:28.990 battles with the people groups aroundthem and then a few tribes even begin to
00:06:33.250 settle in the Promised Land. So the book ends with the new generation poised to
00:06:38.340 enter into the land
00:06:39.449 and Moses is about to deliver his finalwords of wisdom and warning. But for now,
00:06:45.219 that's what the book of Numbers is allabout.
