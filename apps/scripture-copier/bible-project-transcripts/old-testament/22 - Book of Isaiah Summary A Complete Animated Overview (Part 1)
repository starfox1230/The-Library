00:00:03.000 The book of the prophet Isaiah.Isaiah lived in Jerusalem in the latter half of
00:00:07.450 Israel's Kingdom period and he spoke onGod's behalf to the leaders of Jerusalem
00:00:12.080 and Judah. He spoke first of all amessage of God's judgment; he warned
00:00:15.830 Israel's corrupt leaders that theirrebellion against their covenant with
00:00:19.220 God would come at a cost, that God wasgoing to use the great empires of
00:00:23.400 Assyria and after them Babylon to judgeJerusalem if they persisted in idolatry
00:00:28.710 and oppression of the poor, but thatannouncement was combined with a
00:00:32.279 message of hope. Isaiah believed deeplythat God would one day fulfill all of
00:00:37.040 his covenant promises: that he would senda king from David's line to establish
00:00:41.450 God's kingdom (remember 2nd Samuel 7),that he would lead Israel in obedience
00:00:45.670 to all of the laws of the Covenant madeat Mount Sinai (remember Exodus chapter 19),
00:00:50.220 and all of this was so that God'sblessing and salvation would flow
00:00:54.219 outward to all of the nations like Godpromised to Abraham in Genesis chapter 12,
00:00:59.140 and it's this hope that compelledIsaiah to speak out against the
00:01:02.899 corruption and idolatry of Israel in his day.Now the book has a pretty complex literary
00:01:08.080 design, but there's one simple way to seehow it all fits together: chapters 1 through 39
00:01:12.590 contain three large sections thatdevelop Isaiah's warning of judgment on
00:01:17.250 Israel, and it all culminates in an eventpointed to at the end of chapter 39 - the
00:01:22.049 fall of Jerusalem and the exile of thepeople to Babylon - but in chapters 1 to 39
00:01:26.509 there's also a message of hope thatafter the exile God's covenant promises
00:01:30.930 would all be fulfilled, and chapters 40to 66 pick up that promise of hope and
00:01:36.070 develops it further. In this video we'rejust gonna focus on chapters 1 to 39. The
00:01:40.640 first main section focuses on Isaiah'svision of judgment and hope for
00:01:44.350 Jerusalem, and it begins as Isaiah accuses thecity's leaders of Covenant rebellion,
00:01:48.869 idolatry, injustice, and God says he'sgoing to judge the city by sending the
00:01:53.409 nations to conquer Israel. Isaiah saysthat this will be like a purifying fire
00:01:58.479 that burns away all that's worthless inIsrael in order to create a new
00:02:03.020 Jerusalem that's populated by a remnantthat has repented and turned back to God
00:02:07.790 and Isaiah says that that's when God'skingdom will come and all nations will
00:02:12.440 come to the temple inJerusalem and learn
00:02:14.630 of God's justice, bringing about aage of universal peace and harmony. Now
00:02:19.720 it's this basic storyline of the oldJerusalem, purifying judgment into the
00:02:24.820 New Jerusalem, this is going to getrepeated over and over throughout the
00:02:29.070 book getting filled in with increasingdetail. So, at the center of this section
00:02:34.280 is Isaiah's grand vision of God sittingon his throne in the temple and he's
00:02:37.990 surrounded by these heavenly creaturesthat are shouting that God is holy holy
00:02:42.420 holy, and Isaiah suddenly realizes justhow corrupt he and his people Israel are,
00:02:47.730 and he's certain that he's going to bedestroyed by God's holiness, but he's not.
00:02:51.950 God holiness in the form of this burningcoal comes and burns him, but not to destroy,
00:02:58.970 rather it purifies him from his sin. Andas Isaiah ponders this strange experience
00:03:04.970 God commissions him with a verydifficult task: he is to keep announcing
00:03:09.010 this coming judgment, but because Israelhas reached a point of no return his
00:03:14.070 warnings are going to have a paradoxicaleffect of hardening the people. But Isaiah
00:03:18.990 is to trust God's plan. Israel is goingto be chopped down like a tree and
00:03:24.350 left like a stump in a field, and thatstump will itself be scorched and burned
00:03:29.260 but after all of that burning God saysthat this smoldering stump is a holy
00:03:34.110 seed that will survive into the future.It's a small sign of hope but who or
00:03:39.410 what is that Holy Seed? The rest of thissection offers an answer. Isaiah
00:03:43.380 confronts Ahaz, a descendant of Davidand a King of Jerusalem, and he announces
00:03:48.120 his downfall. God says that it's thegreat empire of Assyria who will first
00:03:52.990 chop Israel down and devastate the land,but there's hope. Because of God's promise to
00:03:57.459 David he's going to send afterthis destruction a new king named
00:04:02.100 Emmanuel, which means "God with us", andEmanuel's Kingdom is going to set God's
00:04:06.459 people free from violent oppressiveempires, and Isaiah describes this coming
00:04:11.250 king as a small shoot of new growth thatwill emerge from the old stump of David's
00:04:17.200 family. It's this king that's the holyseed from chapter six, and the king is
00:04:21.779 going to be empowered by God's Spirit to
00:04:24.080 rule over a new Jerusalem and bringjustice for the poor and all nations
00:04:28.520 will look to this messianic king forguidance.
00:04:31.020 His kingdom will transform all creationbringing peace. Now you finish chapters
00:04:36.219 1 through 12 with pretty goodunderstanding of Isaiah's message of
00:04:39.460 judgment and hope, but when will this allhappen? Isaiah saw another Empire arising
00:04:46.030 after Assyria, and thats Babylon, whowould also attack Jerusalem and
00:04:50.460 actually succeed in destroying it, andthat brings us in the next sections of
00:04:54.060 the book. So first we have a largecollection of poems that explore God's
00:04:58.159 judgment and hope for the nations.We learn first of all of the fall of
00:05:02.500 Babylon and Israel's neighbors. Isaiahcould see that a serious world power
00:05:07.240 would one day be replaced by the empireof Babylon, a nation even more
00:05:11.819 destructive an arrogant. Babylon's kingsclaimed that they were higher than all
00:05:16.370 other gods and so God vows to bringBabylon down. And not only Babylon, Isaiah
00:05:22.539 goes on to list Israel's neighborsaccusing them all of the same kind of
00:05:26.889 pride and injustice, and he predictstheir ultimate ruin. But remember for Isaiah
00:05:31.349 God's judgment is never the finalword for Israel or the nations, and that
00:05:35.849 leads into the next section with aseries of poems that tell a tale of two
00:05:39.500 cities. There's the lofty city that hasexalted itself above God and become
00:05:44.610 corrupt and unjust. This city is anarchetype of rebellious humanity and is
00:05:49.469 described with language that's allborrowed from Isaiah's earlier
00:05:52.800 descriptions of Jerusalem and Assyriaand Babylon all put together. This city
00:05:57.550 is destined for ruin and one day isgoing to be replaced by the New
00:06:01.250 Jerusalem where God reigns as king over aredeemed humanity from all nations and
00:06:06.729 there's no more death or suffering. Thesechapters are the climax to this section
00:06:11.349 and it shows how Isaiah's message pointedfar beyond his own day, it was a message
00:06:16.240 for all who are waiting for God to bringhis justice on violent oppressive
00:06:20.830 kingdoms and bring his kingdom ofjustice and peace and healing love. The
00:06:26.039 following section return the focus tothe rise and fall of Jerusalem, and first
00:06:29.830 we find a whole bunch of poems where Isaiahaccuses Jerusalem's leaders for turning to Egypt
00:06:34.419 for military protection
00:06:35.409 against Assyria. He knows thiswill backfire and Isaiah says that only
00:06:39.699 trust in their God and repentance cansave Israel now, which gets illustrated
00:06:44.559 by the following story about the rise ofHezekiah, king of Jerusalem. Just as Isaiah
00:06:49.189 predicted, the Assyrian armies come andtry to attack the city and so Hezekiah
00:06:53.899 humbles himself before God and heprays for divine deliverance and the
00:06:58.439 city is miraculously saved overnight, butHezekiah's rise is immediately
00:07:03.300 followed by his fall. So he hosts adelegation from Babylon and he tries to
00:07:08.429 impress them by showing everything inJerusalem's treasury and temple and
00:07:12.949 palaces, it's clearly an effort to makeanother political alliance for
00:07:17.199 protection. Isaiah hears about this and heconfronts Hezekiah for his foolishness.
00:07:21.249 He predicts that this ally will one daybetray him and return as an enemy to
00:07:26.699 conquer Jerusalem, and we know from2nd Kings chapters 24 and 25 that Isaiah
00:07:31.939 was right. Over a hundred years laterBabylon would turn on Jerusalem, come and
00:07:37.439 destroy the city, its temple, and carrythe Israelites away to exile in Babylon.
00:07:41.759 And so all of Isaiah's warnings ofdivine judgment in chapters 1 to 39 lead
00:07:46.869 up to this moment. He's shown to be atrue prophet because it all came to pass
00:07:51.349 like he said. But remember the purpose ofGod's judgment was to purify Jerusalem
00:07:56.839 and bring the holy seed and messianicKingdom over all nations, and it's that
00:08:01.529 hope that gets explored in the next partof the book, but for now that's what
00:08:05.669 Isaiah chapters 1 to 39 are all about.
