00:00:03.200 The book of Joshua.
00:00:04.480 Let's back up and remember the story so far,
00:00:06.940 So God chose Abraham and then his family became the people of Israel,
00:00:11.240 who are then enslaved down in Egypt.
00:00:14.040 So through Moses, God rescued Israel out of Egypt,
00:00:17.400 he made a covenant with them at Mount Sinai
00:00:19.420 and he brought them through the wilderness.
00:00:22.380 So Israel then camped outside the promised land
00:00:25.340 and Moses called them to obey God’s commands
00:00:28.380 so that they could show all the other nations what God is like.
00:00:32.680 The book of Joshua picks up right after Moses has died
00:00:36.240 and Israel is ready to enter the land.
00:00:38.640 So the story of Joshua is designed with four main movements.
00:00:42.340 Joshua first leads Israel into the promised land,
00:00:45.080 and then once they are there, they meet all this hostility from the Canaanites
00:00:48.800 and so they engage them in battle,
00:00:50.740 then after their victory Joshua divides up the promised land
00:00:54.060 as the inheritance for the twelve tribes
00:00:55.920 and then the book concludes with these final speeches that Joshua gives to the people.
00:01:01.100 So let’s dive in and we will see how all of it flows together.
00:01:04.120 The first section begins with Moses’ death
00:01:06.520 and Joshua is appointed as Israel’s new leader,
00:01:09.720 and the author intentionally presents Joshua as a new Moses,
00:01:14.120 so like Moses, Joshua calls the people to obey the Torah,
00:01:17.880 which means the covenant commands that they were given at Mount Sinai,
00:01:21.160 and then Joshua sends spies into the land
00:01:24.340 just as Moses did back in Numbers chapters 13 and 14
00:01:27.600 except it goes way better this time.
00:01:29.100 In fact, some Canaanites turn and follow the God of Israel,
00:01:33.000 Joshua then leads all Israel across the Jordan river and into the land.
00:01:37.840 Just like the sea parted for Moses in the Exodus
00:01:41.520 so here the river Jordan parts
00:01:43.520 and the priests carry the Ark of the Covenant across
00:01:46.860 leading all Israel with them.
00:01:48.760 Now, in chapter 5 the story transitions,
00:01:51.660 so the people look back to their roots as God’s covenant people
00:01:55.820 and so the new generation is circumcised
00:01:58.120 and they celebrate their first Passover in the land.
00:02:00.740 But then, they turn prepared to go forward
00:02:03.760 and Joshua has this crazy encounter with a mysterious warrior,
00:02:08.000 who, it turns out is the angelic commander of God’s army,
00:02:11.560 and Joshua asks, “Are you for us? Or are you for our enemies?”
00:02:15.940 The warrior responds, “Neither.”
00:02:18.360 Which shows that the real question here
00:02:21.260 is whether Joshua is on God’s side.
00:02:23.580 It makes clear that this whole story is not about Israel versus the Canaanites,
00:02:28.720 rather this is God’s battle,
00:02:30.800 and Israel is going to play the role of spectators or sometimes supporters in God’s plan.
00:02:36.720 Which leads to the next section.
00:02:38.580 We find stories about all these conflicts that Israel has with different Canaanite groups,
00:02:42.980 and the first part retells the story of two battles in detail
00:02:46.980 and that is followed by a series of short stories
00:02:49.780 that condense years of battles into a few brief summaries.
00:02:53.600 So the first two battles are against Jericho and then Ai,
00:02:57.840 and they offer these contrasting portraits of God’s faithfulness versus Israel’s failure.
00:03:04.320 At Jericho, Israel is to take a completely passive approach,
00:03:08.640 so they let God’s presence in the Ark lead them around the city to music for six days
00:03:14.080 and just like Rahab turned to the God of Israel
00:03:16.880 maybe the people of Jericho would do the same, but they don't,
00:03:20.920 and so on the seventh day the priests blow the trumpets
00:03:24.260 and the walls come falling down leading Israel to victory.
00:03:28.180 The point of the story is that God is the one who will deliver his people;
00:03:33.000 Israel simply needs to trust and wait.
00:03:35.560 Now the next story, of the battle of Ai makes the opposite point.
00:03:39.440 So there is this Israelite named Achan,
00:03:41.640 and he steals from Jericho some of the devoted goods that were to belong to God alone
00:03:47.000 and then he lies about it.
00:03:48.660 It’s a pretty lame move after all that God has done for Israel,
00:03:51.720 and so Israel goes into battle with the city of Ai
00:03:54.600 and they are totally defeated,
00:03:56.780 and it’s only after humble repentance
00:03:59.960 and severely dealing with Achan’s sin that Israel gains victory.
00:04:04.360 And so together these two stories are placed right up front to make an important point.
00:04:10.120 If Israel is going to inherit the land,
00:04:13.280 they have to be obedient and trust in God’s commands.
00:04:16.800 They don’t get special treatment.
00:04:18.620 Now the second part of the section begins with the Gibeonites, a Canaanite people group
00:04:23.660 and they do just as Rahab did as they turn to follow the God of Israel
00:04:27.700 and they make peace with Israel.
00:04:29.260 This is in contrast to all these other Canaanite kings
00:04:32.600 who start to form alliances and coalitions and they want to destroy Israel.
00:04:36.920 So Israel engages them in battle and they win by a land slide.
00:04:40.920 So this whole section concludes with this summary list
00:04:44.020 of all of these victories won by Moses and then by Joshua.
00:04:47.900 Now, let’s stop for a second because odds are
00:04:50.860 that these stories and the violence in them, they are going to bother you,
00:04:54.360 and if you are a follower of Jesus, you’re bound to wonder, like,
00:04:57.380 didn’t Jesus said to love your enemies?
00:04:59.980 Why is God declaring war here?
00:05:03.300 So first, why the Canaanites?
00:05:05.560 The main reasons are actually given earlier in the biblical story
00:05:09.240 is that the culture of the Canaanites had become extremely morally corrupt,
00:05:14.000 especially when it comes to sex,
00:05:15.780 go check out Leviticus chapter 18,
00:05:18.120 and they also widely practiced child sacrifice,
00:05:21.400 go see Deuteronomy chapter 12,
00:05:23.400 and so God didn’t want these practices to influence Israel,
00:05:27.340 the Canaanites had to go.
00:05:29.020 Which raises the second question.
00:05:31.000 Did God actually command the destruction of all the Canaanites, like a genocide?
00:05:36.080 So at first glance, you know, you look at the phrases used in these stories.
00:05:40.160 They “totally destroyed them”, they “left no survivor or anything that breathed”,
00:05:44.920 but when you look a second time more closely,
00:05:47.880 you’ll see that these phrases are clearly hyperbole and not literal.
00:05:52.360 So go back to the original command about the Canaanites in Deuteronomy chapter 7.
00:05:57.560 Israel is first told to drive out the Canaanites,
00:06:00.840 but then to totally destroy them
00:06:02.600 and then that is followed by commands to not intermarry with them
00:06:06.120 or enter into business deals with them.
00:06:08.760 So you can’t marry someone that you’ve destroyed.
00:06:11.860 I think you get the point.
00:06:13.540 The same idea applies to the stories in Joshua, look closely.
00:06:17.060 So for example, we’re told in Joshua chapter 10
00:06:19.780 that Israel left no survivors in the cities of Hebron or Debir,
00:06:24.140 but then later in chapter 15 we see these towns
00:06:27.180 and they’re still populated by Canaanites,
00:06:29.900 and so what we’re seeing is that Joshua fits in with other ancient battle accounts
00:06:34.760 by using non-literal hyperbolic language as part of the narrative style.
00:06:39.780 And so the word genocide doesn’t actually fit what we see here.
00:06:43.940 Especially in light of the stories about the Canaanites who did turn to the God of Israel,
00:06:48.340 like Rahab or the Gibeonites, God was open to those who would turn to him.
00:06:52.680 The last thing to think about is that these stories mark a unique moment in Israel’s history.
00:06:57.940 These battles were limited to the handful of people groups living in the land of Canaan.
00:07:03.560 With all other nations, Israel was commanded by God to pursue peace,
00:07:08.360 go read Deuteronomy chapter 20.
00:07:10.760 So the purpose of these battle stories was never to tell you, the reader,
00:07:14.200 to go commit violence in God’s name.
00:07:16.640 Rather, they show God bringing his justice
00:07:19.700 on human evil at a unique moment in history,
00:07:22.580 and how he delivered Israel from being annihilated by the Canaanites.
00:07:26.820 Now, let’s go back to the book’s design.
00:07:29.520 After years of battles we see an aging Joshua
00:07:32.480 and he starts dividing up the land for the twelve tribes of Israel,
00:07:36.160 and most of this section is like lists of boundary lines,
00:07:39.020 and let us be honest, it’s kind of boring.
00:07:41.360 It’s like reading a map that has no pictures.
00:07:44.360 But for the Israelites these lists were super important.
00:07:48.200 This was the fulfillment of God’s ancient promises to Abraham
00:07:51.340 that his descendants would inherit the promised land.
00:07:54.540 . And so now it was all coming to pass right down to the detail,
00:07:58.440 which leads to the final section.
00:08:00.680 Joshua gives two speeches to the people
00:08:02.840 they’re very similar to the final speeches of Moses in Deuteronomy.
00:08:06.660 Joshua reminds them of God’s generosity,
00:08:09.400 how he brought them into the land and rescued them from the Canaanites.
00:08:12.680 And so, he calls them to turn away from the Canaanite gods
00:08:15.860 and be faithful to the covenant they made.
00:08:18.940 If they do, it will lead to life and blessing in the land,
00:08:22.800 but if they’re unfaithful,
00:08:24.640 Israel will call down on itself the same divine judgement that the Canaanites experienced.
00:08:30.040 They’ll be kicked off the land into exile,
00:08:32.640 and so Joshua leaves Israel with a choice.
00:08:35.380 What is Israel going to do?
00:08:37.280 That’s the big question that looms as the story ends.
00:08:41.360 And that’s the book of Joshua.
