00:00:02.350 The book of Ruth.
00:00:03.400 It's a brilliant work of theological art and it invites us to reflect on the question of
00:00:09.300 how God is involved in the day-to-day joys and hardships of our lives.
00:00:14.200 There are three main characters in the book:
00:00:16.100 Naomi, the widow, Ruth, the Moabite and Boaz, the Israelite farmer.
00:00:21.700 And their story is told in four chapters that are beautifully designed.
00:00:25.500 Let's just dive in and see how this all unfolds. Chapter one opens withthis line: "In the days when the judges
00:00:32.149 ruled." And it reminds us of the very darkand difficult days from the book of
00:00:36.649 Judges. And here we meet an Israelitefamily in Bethlehem struggling to
00:00:41.670 survive through a famine. And so, insearch of food, they move on to the land
00:00:45.960 of Moab, Israel's ancient enemy. And there, the father of the family dies and the
00:00:51.429 sons marry two Moabite women, Ruth and Orpah.  And then the sons, they die too and so
00:00:57.699 they leave only Naomi and these newdaughters-in-law. And so Naomi, she has no
00:01:02.879 reason to stay anymore. And so she tellsher new daughters-in-law that she's
00:01:06.439 moving back home. And Naomi, she knowsthat the life of an unmarried foreign
00:01:11.310 widow in Israel is going to be very hard. So she compels the women to stay behind.
00:01:16.229 Orpah agrees but Ruth does not. She showsremarkable loyalty to Naomi and she says,
00:01:23.750 "Wherever you go, I'm going to go. Your peoplewill become my people and your God will
00:01:29.560 become my God."  And so the two of themreturn to Israel together and the chapter
00:01:34.579 concludes with Naomi changing her name
00:01:37.409 to Mara, which means "bitter" in Hebrew,and she laments her tragic fate. Chapter
00:01:42.920 two begins with Naomi and Ruthdiscussing where they're going to find
00:01:46.329 food and it just so happens to be thebeginning of the barley harvest. And so
00:01:51.020 Ruth goes out to look for food and itjust so happens that she ends up
00:01:54.770 picking grain in the field of a mannamed Boaz, who just so happens to be
00:01:59.719 Naomi's relative. We're told that Boaz isa man of noble character and
00:02:04.620 he notices her. So after finding out moreabout her story, he shows remarkable
00:02:09.710 generosity to her. He makes these specialprovisions so that the immigrant Ruth
00:02:14.280 can gather grain in his field. And indoing so
00:02:17.370 Boaz is actually obeying an explicitcommand in the Torah to show generosity
00:02:21.270 to the immigrant and the poor. Boaz is so impressed by Ruth's loyalty to Naomi,
00:02:27.250 he prays for her that God will rewardher for her boldness. So Ruth comes home
00:02:32.980 that day and Naomi finds out that shemet Boaz and she is thrilled. She says
00:02:39.180 Boaz is their family Redeemer. Now this"family redeemer" thing, this was a
00:02:44.280 cultural practice in Israel where if aman in the family died and he left
00:02:48.340 behind a wife or children or land, it wasthe family Redeemer's responsibility to
00:02:52.950 marry that widow, to take up the landand protect that family. So Naomi, she
00:02:57.950 begins to hope that perhaps there mightstill be a future for her family.
00:03:02.480 Chapter 3 begins with Naomi and Ruthmaking a plan to get Boaz to notice
00:03:07.090 their situation. So Ruth is going tostop wearing clothes of a grieving
00:03:11.330 widow and she's going to show signs thatshe is available to be married. And so
00:03:15.540 Ruth goes to meet Boaz on the farm thatnight and as she approaches, Boaz wakes
00:03:20.730 up. And he's totally startled. And Ruthmakes her intentions very clear. She asks
00:03:25.230 if Boaz will redeem Naomi's family andmarry her.
00:03:29.420 Boaz is once again amazed by Ruth's loyaltyto Naomi and her family and he calls
00:03:34.850 Ruth a woman of noble character. It's thesame term used to describe the woman in
00:03:40.110 Proverbs 31. So Boaz tells Ruthto wait until the next day and he will
00:03:45.150 redeem both Ruth and Naomi legallybefore the town elders. And so the
00:03:49.739 chapter ends with Ruth returning to Naomi and they marvel together at all of
00:03:54.239 these recent events. In chapter four itall comes together. It turns out, at the
00:03:58.820 last minute,
00:03:59.790 Boaz discovers there is a family memberwho's closer to Naomi than he is and
00:04:04.400 he's actually eligible before him toredeem the family. But at the last second
00:04:09.019 this family member finds out that he'sgoing to have to marry Ruth the Moabite.
00:04:13.180 And so he declines. But Boaz, remember,he knows Ruth's true character, and so he
00:04:18.839 acquires the family property of Naomiand he marries Ruth. And so just as at the
00:04:24.389 beginning, how Ruth was loyal to Naomi'sfamily, so now Boaz is loyal to Naomi's
00:04:30.139 family as well.
00:04:31.400 The story concludes with a reversal ofall of the tragedies from chapter one. So
00:04:36.150 the death of the husband and the sons isreversed as Ruth is married again and
00:04:41.320 gives birth to a new son, granting joy to Naomi. And this symmetry between the opening and
00:04:47.030 the closing, its even more remarkable.
00:04:49.460 So, remember the opening tragedy wasfollowed by a great act of loyalty on the
00:04:53.599 part of Ruth and that is now matched by Boaz'sact of loyalty that leads to the
00:04:59.199 family's final restoration. And thissymmetry, it highlights the design of the
00:05:04.349 internal chapters as well.
00:05:06.630 Each of the chapters begins with Naomiand Ruth making a plan for the future.
00:05:10.410 And that's followed by a providentialmeeting between Ruth and Boaz. And each
00:05:15.979 chapter concludes with Naomi and Ruthrejoicing at what's taken place. This
00:05:21.039 story is beautifully designed and thatdesign actually connects with the really
00:05:25.210 interesting feature of the story andthat's how little God is mentioned. The
00:05:30.750 characters talk about God a few timesbut the narrator actually never once
00:05:35.870 mentions God doing anything directly inthe story and that its brilliance--
00:05:41.330 because God's providence is at workbehind every scene of the story, weaving
00:05:46.050 together the circumstances and choicesof all these characters. So Naomi, her
00:05:50.970 tragedy leads her to think that God ispunishing her but actually the whole
00:05:54.849 story is about God's mission to restoreher and her family. And he's doing so
00:05:59.710 through Ruth, through her boldness and loyalty,which brings healing to Naomi's life. But
00:06:05.680 not without Boaz, who's a no-nonsensefarmer who's full of generosity and
00:06:10.680 loyalty. And so God uses his integritycombined with Ruth's boldness to save
00:06:15.710 Naomi and
00:06:16.380 her family. So this story brilliantlyexplores the interplay of God's purposes
00:06:22.270 and will with human decision and will.God weaves together the faithful
00:06:27.810 obedience of his people to bring abouthis redemptive purposes in the world. And
00:06:32.370 that leads to the real end of the story.The Book of Ruth concludes with the
00:06:36.700 genealogy showing how Boaz and Ruth's son, Oved,was the grandfather of King
00:06:42.780 David, from whom came the lineage of theMessiah. And so all of a sudden these
00:06:48.540 seemingly mundane, ordinary events in thestory are woven into God's grand story
00:06:54.860 of redemption for the whole world. And sothe book of Ruth invites us to consider
00:07:00.790 how God might be at work in the veryordinary, mundane details of our lives as
00:07:07.010 well. And that's what the book of Ruth isall about.
