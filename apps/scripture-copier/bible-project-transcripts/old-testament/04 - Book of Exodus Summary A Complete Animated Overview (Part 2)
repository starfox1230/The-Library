00:00:02.900 The book of Exodus. In the first video weexplored chapters 1 through 18, which
00:00:07.560 tell the foundational story of how Godrescued the enslaved Israelites by
00:00:12.049 confronting and defeating Pharaoh whileoffering the way of escape through the
00:00:16.250 blood of the Passover lamb. God thendelivered his people by bringing them
00:00:20.050 through the waters of the sea and theninto the wilderness, where surprisingly
00:00:24.550 they grumbled and complained. Now thesecond half of the book of Exodus opens
00:00:28.910 as Moses leads Israel to the foot ofMount Sinai, where God invites the nation
00:00:33.760 of Israel to enter into a covenantrelationship. And here we reach another
00:00:37.990 key moment in the biblical storylinebecause this is picking up in developing
00:00:42.520 God's promise to Abraham. So rememberfrom the book of Genesis, God promised
00:00:46.990 that through Abraham's family, somehow he would restore his blessing to all of the
00:00:51.670 nations. And here we find out more.
00:00:54.020 God says that if Israel obeys the termsof the Covenant, they will be so shaped
00:00:58.860 by God's laws and teaching and justicethat they will become a kingdom of
00:01:03.230 priests, which means that they willbecome God's representatives and show all
00:01:07.910 of the other nations what God is trulylike. Now the people of Israel eagerly
00:01:12.440 accept the offer and so God's presenceappears right on the top of Mount Sinai
00:01:16.520 in the form of clouds and lightning andthunder. And Moses goes up as their
00:01:21.220 representative and God opens with thebasic terms of the Covenant the famous
00:01:26.159 Ten Commandments. These are like the basic terms of the agreement--
00:01:30.380 how the Israelites and God are going to relate to each other. And then after this come
00:01:34.680 another collection of commands which fillout the first 10 in more detail.There are
00:01:39.450 laws about Israel's worship, about socialjustice, how they are to live together;
00:01:43.510 all shaping Israel into a nation ofjustice and generosity that's different
00:01:49.140 from the other nations.So Moses writesdown all of these laws and he brings
00:01:52.820 them down to the people, who again
00:01:55.240 eagerly agreed to enter into thiscovenant with God. And once they do so,
00:01:59.299 God takes the relationship forwardanother step. He tells Moses that he
00:02:03.290 wants his holy, divine, good presence tocome and dwell right in the midst of
00:02:08.239 Israel, which develops another aspect ofGod's covenant promises. Remember after
00:02:13.069 humanities rebellion
00:02:14.730 in the garden, it was access to God'spresence that was lost. But now it's
00:02:19.440 through the family of Abraham that God'spresence is becoming once again
00:02:23.340 accessible through this covenantrelationship. And first with Israel and
00:02:27.959 then somehow one day to all nations. Sowhat follows are seven chapters of
00:02:32.709 detailed architectural blueprints aboutthis sacred tent called the tabernacle.
00:02:37.910 There's the outer courtyard with analter and then in the center there's a
00:02:42.319 tent that has an outer room and then inner room and then inside the inner room,
00:02:47.150 which is called the most holy place, is agolden box called the Ark of the
00:02:51.269 Covenant. And there's angelic creaturesover the top of it. It's the hot-spot of
00:02:56.319 God's presence. Now there's lots of detail in these chapters and it's important to
00:03:00.239 know that every piece has some kind ofsymbolic value. All of the flowers, the
00:03:05.140 angels, the gold and jewels-- it all echoesback to the Garden of Eden-- the place
00:03:10.450 where God and humans lived together inintimacy. And so the tabernacle is like a
00:03:15.370 portable Eden, so to speak.
00:03:16.959 It's the place where God and Israel canlive together in peace, at least in
00:03:22.040 theory, because right here something goes really, really wrong. Israel breaks the
00:03:26.669 covenant. As Moses is up on the mountain receiving the blueprint for the
00:03:30.750 tabernacle, down below at the camp, the Israelites, they're losing patience. And so
00:03:35.669 they asked Moses's brother Aaron to makefor them a golden calf idol so they can
00:03:40.810 worship it as the God who saved them outof slavery in Egypt. Now God's presence,
00:03:45.959 it's right there on top of the mountain; they can see it,  but here they are below
00:03:50.639 breaking the first two commands of theCovenant they just agreed to-- no other
00:03:55.950 gods and no idols. Now what follows isreally important.
00:04:00.209 God knows what's happening down below. So he first invites Moses into his own
00:04:04.329 anger and pain and he tells Moses whathe wants to do--just to wipe Israel out.
00:04:09.970 But Moses intercedes by appealing toGod's character. He says, first of all,
00:04:14.579 destroying Israel would be going back onyour covenant promises to Abraham. And
00:04:18.858 then Moses appeals to God's reputationamong the nation's. What would they think
00:04:22.330 if they see you destroy
00:04:23.840 your own people?  And so God accepts Moses's intercession and he relents. And while
00:04:29.730 he does bring his judgment on those whoinstigated idolatry, he forgives the
00:04:34.040 nation as a whole and promises to renewhis covenant. And it's right here at this
00:04:39.320 point in the story that God for thefirst time describes his own character
00:04:43.080 to Moses. He says, "The Lord is mercifuland gracious. He's slow to anger,
00:04:49.460 abounding in covenant faithfulness. Heforgives sin but he will not leave the
00:04:55.389 wicked unpunished."
00:04:56.790 We have this tension: God is full ofmercy but also he must deal with evil if
00:05:01.979 he claims to be good. And above all, Godis faithful to His promises even though
00:05:06.870 it means he knows he's committinghimself to a people who are utterly
00:05:11.229 faithless. And so after renewing thecovenant with Israel, God commissions
00:05:15.970 Moses to go ahead and build thetabernacle. And once again we get five
00:05:19.970 long chapters describing in detail theconstruction of the tabernacle. And it
00:05:24.870 all comes together in the final chapterwhere the Tabernacle is finished. God's
00:05:29.400 glorious divine presence comes andhovers over the tent and our hopes are
00:05:33.710 high. And so Moses, he goes right up toenter into the tent, and he can't.  He actually
00:05:39.340 can't go in and that's how the book ends.It's really surprising, but not really if
00:05:44.950 you think about it. You can see now howmuch Isreal's sin has damaged the
00:05:49.130 relationship with God in more ways thanwe realized. So the book opened, remember,
00:05:54.650 with Pharaoh's evil threatening Israel andthreatening God's covenant promise. But
00:05:59.280 now as the book ends, Israel has becomeits own worst enemy. It's their sin that is
00:06:04.430 threatening the future of the covenant. And so the question as the book closes
00:06:08.410 is, "How is God going to reconcile thisconflict between his holiness and his
00:06:13.789 goodness in His presence with thesinful corruption of his own covenant
00:06:18.410 people?"  The solution to that problem iswhat the next book is about, but for now,
00:06:22.440 that's the book of Exodus.
