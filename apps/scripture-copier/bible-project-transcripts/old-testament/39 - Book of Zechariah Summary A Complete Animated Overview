00:00:03.500 The book of the prophet Zechariah
00:00:06.000 The book is set after the return of the exiles from Babylon to Jerusalem
00:00:10.000 and we´re told in the book of Ezra
00:00:12.000 that Zechariah and Haggai together
00:00:14.000 challenged and motivated the people to rebuild the temple
00:00:16.780 and look for the fulfillment of God's promises.
00:00:19.600 Now long ago Jeremiah, the prophet, had said that Israel's exile would last for seventy years
00:00:24.980 and that afterwards God would restore His presence to a new temple and bring
00:00:29.480 his kingdom and the rule of the Messiah over all nations.
00:00:32.659 The dates at the beginning of this book tell us that those seventy years
00:00:36.620 are almost up.
00:00:38.060 But life back in the land was hard, and it seems like none of these promises were going to come true.
00:00:43.260 why? And the book of Zechariah offers an explanation.
00:00:46.380 It has a fairly clear design,
00:00:48.200 there is an introduction, which sets the tone for a large collection of Zechariah´s dream visions
00:00:53.560 and that's concluded by chapter 7 and 8.
00:00:55.580 And then this is followed by two more large collections of poetry and prophecy
00:01:00.200 let's just dive in and see how the book works.
00:01:02.320 It begins with Zechariah´s challenge to his generation
00:01:05.260 to turn back to God and not be like their ancestors
00:01:08.320 who rebelled and refused to listen to the earlier prophets
00:01:11.460 Which landed them in exile
00:01:13.400 And so now the returned exiles respond positively to Zechariah
00:01:16.940 they repent and humble themselves before God or so it seems.
00:01:21.300 The next large section is a collection of eight nighttime visions
00:01:24.940 that Zechariah experiences and
00:01:26.760 just to prepare you, these are full of very bizarre strange images, a lot like your dreams.
00:01:32.300 The idea that God communicates to people through symbolic dreams is very old and goes back to the book of Genesis
00:01:37.300 The dreams of Jacob or Joseph or Pharaoh, these gave
00:01:41.460 meaning to current events at the time, but they also gave a window into the future
00:01:46.080 and so Zechariah has his own dreams now and they've been arranged in this cool symmetrical design.
00:01:51.840 The first and the last visions are about four horsemen each
00:01:55.600 they are like rangers patrolling the world on God´s behalf
00:01:58.720 and it's a representation of God's attentive watch over the nations
00:02:01.960 the report is  that the world is at peace
00:02:05.040 and in Zechariah's day this refers to how God raised up Persia to conquer Babylon and bring peace.
00:02:10.900 And so the question now arises, the seventy years of Israel's exile are almost up
00:02:15.820 is now the time for the messianic kingdom in Jerusalem
00:02:18.860 and God responds by saying that He is determined to fulfill those promises
00:02:22.660 but He leaves the question of timing unanswered
00:02:26.300 the second and seventh visions are paired because they're both reflections on Israel's  past sin, that led up to the exile.
00:02:33.060 So, the second vision is about these horns, that symbolize the nations that attacked and then scattered Israel.
00:02:39.300 Assyria and Babylon
00:02:40.960 But then these horns or empires are themselves scattered by a group of blacksmiths
00:02:46.160 an image for Persia.
00:02:47.760 The seventh dream is about a woman in a basket and we are told she is a symbol of the centuries of Israel's covenant rebellion
00:02:54.840 and then this woman is carried off to babylon by other women who carry the basket flying with stork wings
00:03:01.340 this is so strange. The third and sixth visions are paired as they're both about the rebuilding of a new Jerusalem
00:03:07.240 so a man is measuring the city, it's an image of God's promise that Jerusalem will be rebuilt
00:03:12.340 and become a beacon to the nations
00:03:14.340 who will join God´s people in worship
00:03:16.360 and then the sixth dream is about a scroll that flies around the new Jerusalem
00:03:21.040 punishing thieves and liars
00:03:23.040 the idea being that the new Jerusalem is a place that´s purified from sin by the scriptures
00:03:28.560 the fourth and fifth visions are at the center of these collection, and they're about the two key leaders among the returned exiles
00:03:34.840 so Joshua,  the high priest, and then Zerubbabel the royal descendant of David.
00:03:39.740 So Joshua, had been symbolically wearing Israel´s sin in the form of theses dirty clothes
00:03:44.920 but then those are taken off and he's given new clothes and a new turban, a symbol of God's grace and forgiveness.
00:03:51.220 and then an angel tells Joshua that if he remains faithful to God, he will lead his people
00:03:56.800 and Joshua will become a symbol of the future messianic king
00:04:01.020 The other vision is about two olive trees that supply oil to this elaborate gold lamp
00:04:06.660 which itself is a symbol of God´s watchful eye over his people
00:04:10.860 and these two trees symbolize the two anointed leaders: Joshua and then Zerubbabel
00:04:15.660 who's leading the temple rebuilding efforts
00:04:18.060 and God says that success will not come to this new temple if
00:04:21.680 it's the result only of political maneuvering
00:04:24.900 rather these two leaders must be dependant upon the work of God´s spirit
00:04:29.620 The visions come to a close with a bonus vision from the prophet
00:04:33.280 and it picks up the themes of the central fourth and fifth visions
00:04:36.820 it's Joshua the high priest again and he's given a crown and presented as a symbol
00:04:41.240 of the future messiah who will also be a priest over God's kingdom
00:04:45.860 and then Zechariah closes it all out saying that all of these visions will be fulfilled only if
00:04:50.780 the current generation is faithful to God
00:04:54.400 and obeys the  terms of the covenant.
00:04:56.400 And so altogether  these three visions emphasize how the coming of the messianic kingdom
00:05:00.360 is conditional upon this generation being faithful to God
00:05:04.180 which leads to the conclusion of the dreams
00:05:06.360 it's another challenge from Zechariah
00:05:08.360 and a group of Israelites come and they've been mourning over the former temple´s destruction for nearly seventy years
00:05:14.320 and they ask him:" is it time to stop grieving? I mean it's God's kingdom going to come very soon?"
00:05:18.800 and Zechariah again reminds them of how their ancestors rejected God's call through the prophets
00:05:24.520 which led to the exile, and so he challenges them too.
00:05:27.980 He says:"this generation will see the messianic kingdom only if
00:05:32.500 they pursue justice and peace and remain faithful to the covenant
00:05:36.440 So, in other words Zechariah reverses their question. He asks are you going to become the kind of people who are ready to receive and participate
00:05:44.640 in God´s coming kingdom
00:05:46.640 and that question is left just hanging there, the people don´t answer and the book just moves on
00:05:51.340 And so we come to the final sections that are very different from chapters one to eight
00:05:55.980 Each section is a kaleidoscopic collage of poems and images
00:06:00.020 about the future messianic kingdom
00:06:01.920 so the first one chapters nine to eleven, describe the coming of the humble messianic king
00:06:06.860 who's riding a donkey into the new Jerusalem to establish God's kingdom over the nations
00:06:11.080 but then, all of a sudden, this king, he is symbolized as a shepherd
00:06:15.100 over the flock of Israel, and then he´s rejected
00:06:18.220 first by his own people, but then also by their leaders
00:06:21.800 who are also symbolized as shepherds
00:06:23.800 and so God hands Israel over to these corrupt shepherds
00:06:27.300 and it raises the question
00:06:29.300 will Israel's rejection of their king last forever?
00:06:32.380 and the final section, chapters twelve to fourteen say no.
00:06:35.740 It´s another mosaic of poems and images about the future messianic kingdom
00:06:39.460 and they depict the new Jerusalem as place where God's justice will finally confront and defeat evil
00:06:45.200 among the nations. it´s very similar to the  same themes in prophet Joel or Ezekiel
00:06:49.500 But then God also will confront the rebellion within the hearts of his own people
00:06:53.960 He´s going to pour out His spirit on them. He says, so that they can repent and grieve
00:06:59.000 over the fact that they have rebelled and rejected their messianic shepherd
00:07:03.800 The final chapter concludes with the new Jerusalem. That´s the gathering point for all of the nations
00:07:08.520 And then this city becomes a new garden of Eden, and there´s a river of living water flowing out of the temple
00:07:13.900 bringing healing to all of creation and that's how the book ends.
00:07:17.600 And so Zechariah just leaves you to ponder the connection
00:07:20.860 between  chapters one thru eight and nine to fourteen
00:07:24.020 and the point seems to be that this future messianic kingdom
00:07:27.320 of the book's second half will only come when God's people are faithful to the covenant
00:07:32.680 the point of the first half.
00:07:34.440 Reading the book of Zechariah is a wild ride. These visions and poems  are full of starling imagery
00:07:39.500 and they do not follow a linear flow of thought
00:07:42.540 and that's part of the point. It´s like history and our lives,
00:07:46.140 it doesn't always fit into neat orderly patterns
00:07:49.580 but the prophet offer us glimpses of God's hand at work
00:07:53.140 guiding history towards His own purposes
00:07:55.620 and so ultimately Zechariah invites us to look above the chaos
00:07:59.480 and hope for the coming of God's kingdom
00:08:01.640 which should motivate faithfulness in the present
00:08:04.640 and that's what the book of Zechariah is all about.
