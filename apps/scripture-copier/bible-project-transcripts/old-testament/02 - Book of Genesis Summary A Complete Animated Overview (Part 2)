00:00:04.120 The book of Genesis. In the first video we saw how chapters 1 through 11 set up
00:00:08.610 the basic storyline of the Bible. God has created all things and he makes humans
00:00:13.610 in His image to rule the world on hisbehalf. The humans choose sin and
00:00:18.240 rebellion and so the world spins out ofcontrol into violence and death all
00:00:22.460 leading up to the rebellion andscattering of the people in Babylon.
00:00:26.650 And so the big question is what is God going to do to rescue and redeem his world?
00:00:31.680 Well out of that scattering at Babylon, the author traces the genealogy of just one
00:00:36.789 family that leads eventually to a mannamed Abram, later known as Abraham.
00:00:42.050 And God's promise to Abraham at thebeginning of chapter 12 opens up a whole
00:00:46.089 new movement in the story. God callsAbraham to leave his home and go to the
00:00:49.979 land of Canaan which God says willbecome his one day. And in that land, God
00:00:54.920 promises to make Abraham into a great nation, to make his name great and bless him.
00:00:59.899 Now these promises are connectedback to earlier parts of the book.
00:01:03.999 So Babylon had arrogantly tried to make a great name for itself and that didn't go
00:01:09.060 very well. But God in his generosityis going to bestow a great name on this
00:01:14.960 no-name guy, Abraham, and God's blessing of Abraham echoes all the way back to
00:01:20.260 that original blessing God gave humanity in the beginning. So the question is: "Why
00:01:24.940 is God going to blessed Abraham and his family?" And the last line of God's
00:01:29.210 promise makes this clear: "So that all the families of the earth will find God's
00:01:34.000 blessing in you." Now this is key forunderstanding the whole rest of the
00:01:38.310 biblical story. God's plan is to rescueand bless his rebellious world through
00:01:43.930 Abraham's family and this is why thewhole rest of the Old Testament story is
00:01:48.180 just going to focus on this one family,
00:01:50.150 eventually called the people ofIsrael. This is also why Israel will
00:01:54.100 later be called a kingdom of priests atMount Sinai. God wants to use them to
00:01:58.880 show all of the other nations what he'slike and ultimately this is the promise
00:02:03.850 that gets picked up by the laterbiblical prophets and poets who say that
00:02:07.680 its fulfillment will come throughIsrael's messianic king,
00:02:10.990 whose reign will bring justice andpeace to all of the nations. Now at this
00:02:15.760 point of the story, none of that is clear.
00:02:18.080 You just have to keepreading and watch the promise develop.
00:02:21.070 And so the rest of the book focuses on Abraham and his family. First Abraham
00:02:25.220 himself, then his son Isaac and then his son Jacob and then Jacob's twelve sons.
00:02:31.030 And the stories about each generation, they're united by two main themes.
00:02:35.420 So first, each generation of Abraham'sfamily is marked by repeated failure.
00:02:40.320 They just keep making really baddecisions that mess up their lives and
00:02:44.920 put God's promise in jeopardy.
00:02:46.830 However God remains faithful to them. He keeps rescuing them from themselves and
00:02:52.590 reaffirming his commitment to bless them and bless the nations through them
00:02:56.870 despite their failings. So the Abrahamstories - God had promised Abraham huge
00:03:01.780 family -  but on two different occasionshe's afraid for his life because other
00:03:05.540 men are attracted to his wife and so he denies that he's even married to her,
00:03:09.880 which creates, of course, all of theseproblems. And not only that, Abraham and
00:03:14.070 his wife Sarah they can't have childrenand so Sarah arranges for Abraham to
00:03:18.480 sleep with one of their servant girls,which also creates all of these problems
00:03:22.300 in the family. But each time God balesAbraham out and in chapters 15 and 17 God
00:03:28.510 even formalizes his promise to Abraham with an official commitment called
00:03:32.660 a covenant. This is a classic scene. God invites Abraham to look up at the night
00:03:37.390 stars and to count them and he says that's how numerous your family's going to be.
00:03:42.110 And despite all of the odds - having nokids and no way to have any at the
00:03:46.800 moment, Abraham looks up in the sky and simply trusts God's promise. And God
00:03:52.950 responds by entering into a covenantwith Abraham, promising that he will
00:03:57.290 become a father of many nations, thatGod's blessing may come to the whole world.
00:04:02.070 And then God asked Abraham to mark his family with a sign of the covenant:
00:04:06.910 circumcision of all the male boys in the family. This is a symbol to remind them
00:04:11.680 that the fruitfulness of their family isa gift from God. And so Abraham has lots
00:04:17.000 of kids eventually and he dies at a good old age.
00:04:20.130 Now the Jacob stories play out thesethemes even more dramatically. From birth,
00:04:24.660 Jacob lives up to the meaning of hisname, which is "deceiver". He cheats his
00:04:28.970 brother Esau out of his inheritance and blessing and he does it by deceiving his old
00:04:33.540 blind father no less, and then hejust takes off. He goes on to take four
00:04:38.780 wives even though he really only loves one, Rachel and this creates all of these
00:04:43.340 rivalries in the family.
00:04:45.130 The only thing that humbles Jacob isbeing deceived by his uncle Laban, who
00:04:51.090 cheats him out of years of his life.
00:04:53.860 The tables have finally turned. And soit's a humbled Jacob that returns to his homeland.
00:04:58.930 In a very strange story Jacob ends upwrestling with God as he demands that
00:05:05.480 God bless him. Some things never really change, do they? However, God honors his
00:05:10.310 determination and he passes Abraham's blessing on to him and he renamed Jacob
00:05:15.450 as Israel, which means "wrestles with God."Now it's this last part of the book the
00:05:21.600 story of Jacob sons where all the themes come to a head. Jacob loves his second to
00:05:26.790 youngest son Joseph more than any of the others and he gives him a special jacket.
00:05:30.460 And the 10 older sons come tohate Joseph and so they kidnap him and
00:05:34.980 they plan to kill him, but instead theydecide to just sell him into slavery in
00:05:39.100 Egypt where he ends up in prison. Talkabout family failure. But God is with
00:05:45.020 Joseph and He orchestrates Joseph'srelease from prison and Pharaoh ends up
00:05:50.380 elevating Joseph to second in command over all of Egypt. And so Joseph saves
00:05:55.460 the nation of Egypt during a famine and he also ends up saving his brothers and
00:05:59.940 his family from starving to death. And so once again we can see the folly and the
00:06:04.850 sin of Abraham's family is met withGod's faithfulness, who subverts even the
00:06:10.220 evil of the brothers into an occasion tosave life. And this is actually what
00:06:15.470 Joseph says right near the end of thebook. He says to his brother's, "You planned
00:06:19.210 this for evil but God planned itfor good, to save many lives." Now these words
00:06:26.080 are strategically placed at the end ofthe book because they summarize not only
00:06:30.150 the story of Joseph and his brothers, but the book as a whole.
00:06:33.000 From Genesis 3 onward, humanskeep acting selfishly and doing evil but
00:06:39.190 this God does not going to leave hisworld to its own devices. He remains
00:06:43.540 faithful and determined to bless people despite their failures. You can see this
00:06:48.260 especially in how that mysteriouspromise about the descendant of the
00:06:51.930 woman gets developed throughout the book. So remember Genesis 3? God promised
00:06:56.650 that this wounded Victor would come and crush the snake and defeat evil at its source.
00:07:01.460 And the author then connects thispromise directly to the line of Abraham.
00:07:06.390 This is a part of how God's gonna bring his blessing to the nations. Now from
00:07:11.120 Abraham this promise gets connected to  Judah, the fourth son of Jacob. And this is how.
00:07:16.070 In an extremely important poem inchapter 49, an aging Jacob, he's on his
00:07:22.040 deathbed, he wants to bless his twelvesons and when he comes to Judah, Jacob
00:07:27.040 predicts that Judah will become thetribe of Israel's royal leaders and that
00:07:31.140 one day a king will come who willcommand the obedience of all the nations
00:07:36.110 and fulfill God's promise to restore thegarden blessing to all of the world.
00:07:41.580 And then after this Jacob dies and later Joseph dies too. So the growing family
00:07:47.510 remains in Egypt and so the book ofGenesis ends with all of these future
00:07:53.160 hopes and promises left hanging andundeveloped. And it forces you to turn
00:07:57.900 the page to see how it's all going toturn out. But for now that's the book of Genesis.
