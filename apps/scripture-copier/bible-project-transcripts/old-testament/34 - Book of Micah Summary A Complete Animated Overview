00:00:03.840 The book of the prophet Micah.
00:00:05.500 Micah lived in a small town named Moresheth,in the southern kingdom of Judah,
00:00:09.660 about the sametime as Isaiah.
00:00:11.400 And both the northern and southernkingdoms of Israel had split long ago,
00:00:15.280 and both had been violating theircovenant with the God of Israel.
00:00:17.920 So Micah warned that God would bring the big badempire of Assyria to take out the northern kingdom
00:00:23.540 and come ravage Jerusalem.
00:00:25.600 And he also warned that after them,Babylon would bring an even greater destruction.
00:00:30.180 Like all the prophets, Micahspoke on God's behalf to accuse Israel.
00:00:34.650 Or as he puts it in Chapter 3, "I am filledwith strength, with the Spirit of God,
00:00:39.790 with justice and power, to declare howIsrael has rebelled."
00:00:44.180 And so most of this book explores Micah's accusationsand his warnings of God's judgment on Israel.
00:00:50.400 But Micah also had a message of hope,that countered these warnings.
00:00:54.640 About the restoration God would bringon the other side of His judgment.
00:00:58.780 And if you dive into the book with us,you'll see how this works.
00:01:01.680 So the first two sections of the book develop Micah'saccusations and warnings against Israel and its leaders.
00:01:08.240 So part 1 opens with the poeticdescription of God appearing over Israel,
00:01:12.380 just like He did at Mount Sinai.
00:01:14.000 There's fire and smoke and earthquake.
00:01:16.300 But He hasn't come to make a covenant this time.
00:01:18.800 He's come to bring His judgment onIsrael for over 500 years of rebellion.
00:01:24.380 Micah goes on to name all of these towns and citiesin Israel, that are the culprits of all of this rebellion.
00:01:30.480 God's coming for them.
00:01:32.820 But why exactly?
00:01:34.360 So Micah picksa fight with Israel's leaders.
00:01:36.780 He says that they've becomewealthy through theft and greed.
00:01:40.420 He alludes to the story of Ahab stealing a familyvineyard from Naboth in 1 Kings 21.
00:01:46.160 But also, it's becauseIsrael's prophets are corrupt.
00:01:48.860 They're quite happy to offer promises of God'sprotection to anyone who can afford to pay them.
00:01:54.760 "No" Micah says "God haswithdrawn His protection from Israel."
00:01:59.640 In the second section of accusations, Micahdescribes even more how Israel's leaders and prophets
00:02:05.200 have together committed grave injustice.
00:02:07.800 They run the land through bribery.
00:02:10.100 They've bent justice to favor the wealthy.
00:02:12.420 And the poor are deprived of their land,their security, and their hope.
00:02:16.420 And all of this is a violation of the laws of the Torah,
00:02:19.700 which declare it illegal to sell landthat belongs to families, even if they're poor.
00:02:24.920 And so we find out, that God's judgment is going to takethe form of an oppressive nation that comes to take out
00:02:31.360 the northern kingdom and Jerusalem and its temple which will be reduced to ruins.
00:02:36.680 Now these are very stiff warnings.And they're not the final word.
00:02:40.540 Each of these warning sections is concludedwith the striking promise of hope.
00:02:45.460 So first, is a poem about how God is like a shepherdwho's going to rescue and regather His flock,
00:02:51.460 which is the remnant of His people.
00:02:53.300 And He's going to bring them all back to good pasture and become their king once more.
00:02:57.920 The second warning section is concluded by picking upthis image of the ruined Jerusalem temple.
00:03:04.130 And Micah says this won't be permanent.
00:03:06.000 One day, God is going to exalt His temple.
00:03:09.080 He's gonna fill it with His presenceand fill the city with the remnant of His people.
00:03:13.220 And so, God's purpose is to make Israelthe meeting place of heaven and earth.
00:03:18.500 So that all nations will stream to Jerusalem,
00:03:21.700 where God becomes the King of all the nations,bringing peace to the earth.
00:03:26.740 Now these two concluding poems ofhope, they're very powerful.
00:03:30.400 In the next section of the bookactually develops them further
00:03:33.600 into beautifully designed series of poems that areentirely about the future hope of Israel and the nations.
00:03:39.900 So we learn that after the Assyrian attack, Israel will beconquered and exiled to Babylon.
00:03:45.000 But from there God will restore Hispeople and bring them back to their land.
00:03:49.800 And then we learn that  in the New Jerusalem,a new Messianic King from the line of David will come.
00:03:55.489 He'll be born in Bethlehem and then rule inJerusalem over the restored people of God.
00:04:00.540 Finally, in this Messianic Kingdom of God,the faithful remnant of God's people
00:04:05.420 will become that blessing among thenations.
00:04:08.580 But at the same time God will bring Hisfinal justice and remove evil from His world.
00:04:13.920 The final section of the book returnsto this pattern of warning followed by hope,
00:04:18.940 that we saw in the first parts of the book.
00:04:21.139 So Micah exposes again the unjusteconomic practices of Israel's leaders
00:04:26.169 and how it's destroying the land and its people.
00:04:28.600 And here Micah offers his famous words that summarize what it means for Israel to follow their God:
00:04:34.520 "He has told you, o human, what is good,and what the Lord requires of you:"
00:04:40.020 "to do justice, to love mercy,and to walk humbly with your God."
00:04:46.000 This is exactly what Israel has not been doing.And so they will come to ruin.
00:04:51.980 However, the book ends with anotherpowerful note of hope.
00:04:56.389 Israel is personified as an individual,who's sitting alone in shame and defeat.
00:05:01.000 It's a clear image of Israel'sdestruction and exile.
00:05:04.620 And this individual is watching for God's mercyand he begs God to listen and forgive.
00:05:10.460 But why? Why should God listen to and forgive thisfaithless and rebellious people?
00:05:15.740 Well the poet offers two reasons:first, he says because of God's character.
00:05:20.620 "Who is a God like You, who forgivessin and pardons rebellion?"
00:05:26.080 He knows that God's mercy is more powerfulthan His anger or His judgment.
00:05:30.400 And the second reason is because of God's promises.
00:05:33.300 He says "You will stay true to Jacob and show covenant love to Abraham, as You swore so long ago."
00:05:40.200 Now these are the final words of the book.
00:05:42.560 They're an allusion to God'scovenant promises to Abraham and his family
00:05:46.700 all the way back in the book of Genesis:
00:05:48.480 That all nations would find God's blessings throughAbraham's family.
00:05:52.800 But to become a blessing to the nations, Israel must first be faithful to their God.
00:05:57.740 And so this explains this back and forth betweenjudgment and hope in the book of Micah.
00:06:03.120 If God's going to bless the nations through Israel,
00:06:05.600 then He must confront and judgethe evil among His people.
00:06:09.520 But His judgmentis what leads to hope,
00:06:11.980 because God's covenant love and promises aremore powerful than human evil.
00:06:16.560 And His ultimate purpose is not to destroy,it's to save and redeem.
00:06:21.520 Or as the concluding lines of the book put it:
00:06:24.080 "God delights in covenant love,so He will again show compassion."
00:06:28.900 "He will trample our evil;He will toss our sins into the depths of the sea."
00:06:33.880 And that's what the book of Micah is all about.
