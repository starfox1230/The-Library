00:00:03.150 The book of Proverbs. The word proverbtypically refers to a short clever
00:00:07.680 saying that offers some kind of wisdomand this book has a lot of those.
00:00:12.580 But they're almost all in the center section of the book chapters 10 to 29.
00:00:16.400 But there is way more going on in the book ofProverbs especially at the beginning
00:00:21.520 -chapters 1 to 9- and theconclusion -chapters 30 and 31.
00:00:25.820 The book's been designed with an introduction-chapter 1 verses 1 through 9- and it first
00:00:30.580 of all links this book to King Solomonnow remember the story and first Kings chapter 3,
00:00:35.900 Solomon had asked God forwisdom to lead Israel well, and so
00:00:40.190 Solomon became known as the wisest man in the ancient world and we're told in
00:00:44.790 first Kings chapter four, that he wrotethousands of proverbs and poems and
00:00:49.490 collected knowledge about plants andanimals. So Solomon was like the
00:00:53.300 fountainhead of Israel's wisdomliterature. So while not all the material
00:00:58.080 in this book is written by himpersonally, he is where Israel's wisdom
00:01:02.170 tradition began. The introduction saysthat by reading this book you too can
00:01:07.070 gain wisdom. Now wisdom for most of us means knowledge but the Hebrew word Khokhmah
00:01:12.250 means much more than just mentalactivity, it was first to action also.
00:01:17.390 So think skill or applied knowledge. This is why backin the book of Exodus chapter 31,
00:01:22.820 it was artists and craftsmen in Israel who were said to have to Khokhmah.
00:01:28.280 So the purpose of this book is to help youdevelop a set of practical skills for
00:01:32.900 living well in God's world and this getslinked with another key idea in the introduction;
00:01:37.700 The fear of the Lord. Now fear here is not about terror it's about
00:01:43.000 a healthy sense of reverence and awe forGod and about my place in the universe
00:01:48.210 it's a moral mindset that recognizes I amNOT God and that I don't get to make up
00:01:53.610 my own definitions of good and evil ofright and wrong. Rather I need to humble
00:01:58.330 myself before God and embrace God'sdefinition of right and wrong even when
00:02:03.409 that's inconvenient for me. Now thisintroduction leads us into the first
00:02:07.390 main section of the book chapters 1 through 9
00:02:09.990 which also doesn't contain shortone-liner proverbs rather what we find here
00:02:14.370 are 10 speeches from a father to a son. About how the son should listen to
00:02:19.270 wisdom and cultivate the fear of theLord and live accordingly which means a
00:02:23.310 life of virtue and integrity and generosity all of which lead to success and peace.
00:02:29.120 The father warns his son also aboutfolly and evil and stupid decisions that
00:02:34.260 will breed selfishness and pride allleading to ruin and shame. And so the
00:02:39.450 son should make the pursuit of wisdom and the fear of the Lord his highest goal in life.
00:02:44.020 And this way of thinking it formsthe moral logic of this entire book.
00:02:50.460 Now these speeches from the father also clue us into what biblical wisdom literature is
00:02:54.870 and how it's different from other partsof the Bible. These books explore how to
00:02:59.480 live well in God's world but wisdom isnot the same as law, like what Moses gave
00:03:04.980 Israel at Mount Sinai. And it's not thesame as prophecy, divine speech to God's people.
00:03:09.830 Rather wisdom literature has theaccumulated insight of God's people
00:03:15.150 through the generations about how tolive in a way that honors God and others.
00:03:20.120 And so through the book of Proverbs now these human words about wisdom have
00:03:26.230 been put together as God's Word andwisdom to His people. Which connects to the
00:03:31.390 other thing you find in chapters 1through 9. There are four poems from
00:03:35.630 lady wisdom. Here wisdom has beenpoetically personified as a woman who
00:03:40.740 calls out to humanity to pay attentionand to seek her. Wisdom says that she is
00:03:46.490 woven into the fabric of the universeand so wherever you see people making
00:03:50.530 wise decisions they are relying on her.So you see someone being generous or
00:03:55.970 having sexual integrity or upholdingjustice they are drawing on wisdom.
00:04:02.500 These lady wisdom poems they're a creativepoetic way of exploring this idea that
00:04:07.180 we live in God's moral universe and thatgoodness and justice are objective
00:04:13.180 realities  that we ignore to our ownperil. And so fearing the Lord living
00:04:17.600 wisely it's living along the grain of the universe.
00:04:20.899 Now together these two sets ofspeeches from the father and Lady wisdom
00:04:25.200 they make a powerful claim about thisbook that you're not simply reading good advice,
00:04:29.400 you're reading God's own invitation to learn wisdom from previous generations.
00:04:35.180 And so in the next section of the bookchapters 10 to 29 we find
00:04:38.910 hundreds of ancient proverbs and theyapply wisdom in the fear of the Lord to
00:04:42.840 every life topic you could imagine:family, work, neighborhood, friendship, sex,
00:04:47.810 marriage, money, anger, forgiveness, alcohol, debt, everything. And these are all
00:04:52.870 filtered through the value system ofProverbs 1-9. Now these proverbs they're
00:04:58.060 all pretty short, they're easy to memorize andactually this section of the book is
00:05:02.240 meant to become a reference work that you return to time and time again
00:05:06.680 throughout the years which raises some important issues in learning how to read these proverbs.
00:05:11.480 First of all proverbs are by nature about probabilities
00:05:14.900 So you fear the LORD and you make wise good choices,
00:05:18.250 things will likely go well for you. Andif you don't fear the LORD, you're foolish,
00:05:22.650 your life will likely not go so well. Nowthat is all often true but not always.
00:05:30.740 Which leads to the next point.Thatproverbs are not promises, they're not
00:05:35.580 formulas for success. So some proverbs, for example:
00:05:39.780 The fear of the Lord prolongs your life but the years of the wicked are cut short.
00:05:45.340 Or train up a child in the way they should go and when they're old they won't turn from it.
00:05:50.840 So yes, fearing God, being a moral person willmost likely lead to a better longer life
00:05:56.840 and raising your kids in a stable lovinghome does set them up well.
00:06:00.380 But there are no guarantees. Lots of things can and often do go wrong in our world.
00:06:07.620 And so lastly proverbs by naturefocus on the general rule but not the
00:06:13.260 exceptions. Which are many. And the wisdom books actually aren't ignorant of that.
00:06:17.540 The exceptions are with the other wisdombooks Job and Ecclesiastes, are all about.
00:06:22.370 And together these acknowledged thatlife is too complex for simple formulas
00:06:27.520 which is why we need all of the wisdombooks together to get the bigger picture
00:06:31.650 this all leads to the final section ofthe book two large collections of poems
00:06:36.460 first poems from a man named Agur. Who begins by acknowledging his own
00:06:41.640 ignorance and folly, and his great need for God's wisdom.
00:06:45.580 And then Agur discovers that divine wisdom has beengiven to him in the scriptures which
00:06:51.400 teach him how to live well and so Agur is put before us as like a model
00:06:55.950 reader of the book of Proverbs somebodywho's always open to hearing God's
00:07:00.390 wisdom through the scriptures. The final poems are connected to a man named
00:07:04.530 Lemuel he's a non-Israelite king and he passes on the wisdom that was given to him by his mom.
00:07:10.820 ItÂ´s guidance for being a wise and just leader and then the final
00:07:14.300 poem is an acrostic or an alphabet poem whereeach line begins with a new letter of
00:07:19.430 the Hebrew alphabet and the entire poemsabout the woman of noble character.
00:07:24.740 It depicts a woman who lives according tothe wisdom of proverbs and stands like a
00:07:29.570 model of someone who takes God's wisdomand then translates it into practical
00:07:34.990 decisions and everyday life. At work orat home, in her family and in her community.
00:07:41.520 So the book opens with words from a father to a son about listening
00:07:45.120 to Lady wisdom and so now the bookcloses by offering the words of a mother
00:07:50.090 to her son about a woman who liveswisely. The book of Proverbs is for every
00:07:55.570 person in every season of life. It's a guide for living wisely and well in God's good world.
00:08:01.880 And that's what the book ofProverbs is all about.
