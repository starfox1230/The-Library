00:00:03.200 The book of the Prophet Amos
00:00:05.040 Amos was a shepherd and a fig tree farmer
00:00:07.440 who lived right near the border between Northern Israel and Southern Judah.
00:00:11.040 Now, the North had seized its independence about a hundred and fifty years earlier,
00:00:15.060 (remember 1 Kings 12)
00:00:16.500 and it was currently being ruled by Jeroboam the Second,
00:00:19.500 a successful military leader.
00:00:21.580 He won lots of battles and new territories for Israel,
00:00:24.260 and he generated lots of wealth. But!
00:00:26.420 In the eyes of the prophets, he was one of the worst kings ever.
00:00:30.500 His wealth had led to apathy,
00:00:32.400 and he allowed idol worship for the gods of Canaan,
00:00:35.600 which in turn led to injustice and the neglect of the poor.
00:00:39.160 And it got to the point where Amos couldn't take it anymore.
00:00:42.420 He sensed God calling him to go, trek up north to Bethel,
00:00:45.960 an important city that had a large temple,
00:00:48.360 and start announcing God's Word to the people.
00:00:51.260 And this book is a collection of his sermons, and poems,
00:00:54.360 and visions uttered over the years.
00:00:56.340 They were compiled later to give God's people a sense of His divine message to the Northern Kingdom
00:01:01.820 And it's a message we still need to hear today.
00:01:04.980 The book has a fairly clear design:
00:01:06.860 Chapters 1&2 are a series of messages to the nations and Israel;
00:01:12.680 Chapters 3-6 are a collection of poems that expresses the same message to the people of Israel and its leaders
00:01:17.060 Chapters 7-9 contain a series of visions
00:01:19.800 that Amos experienced that depict God's coming judgement on Israel.
00:01:24.220 Let's just dive in.
00:01:25.300 So the book opens with a series of short poems,
00:01:27.560 that accuse all of Israel's neighbors of violence and injustice.
00:01:31.420 And this is kind of odd, because the book's opening line
00:01:34.800 says that Amos is going to speak against Israel.
00:01:37.340 But watch how this works.
00:01:38.840 As Amos is naming all of these neighboring nations,
00:01:42.180 you can go look at a map and see that he is creating a circle
00:01:46.420 And when he's done, Israel lies right in the centre
00:01:49.960 like a target in crosshairs
00:01:52.220 And on Israel, Amos unleashes a poetic accusation
00:01:55.580 that's three times longer and more intense than any of these others.
00:01:58.880 He accuses Israel's wealthy of ignoring the poor
00:02:02.120 And allowing grave injustice in their land,
00:02:04.900 Specifically, by allowing the poor to be sold into debt slavery
00:02:08.800 And then going on to deny any of these people legal representation.
00:02:13.520 And this, Amos asks,
00:02:14.880 "Is this the family that was once denied justice and enslaved in Egypt?
00:02:19.240 The family that God rescued from oppression and slavery?
00:02:22.760 The party's over," Amos says. "God is done putting up with you."
00:02:26.760 And so the opening of the next section explains why.
00:02:29.600 God says, I chose you, Israel, from among all the families of the earth.
00:02:33.980 This is an allusion to Genesis 12
00:02:36.140 How God had called the family of Abraham to become God’s blessing to all of the nations
00:02:40.640 And so then God says,
00:02:42.140 "So this is why I will punish you for all of your sins."
00:02:45.980 Israel had a great calling, which came with great responsibility,
00:02:50.640 and so their sin and rebellion brings great consequences.
00:02:54.560 Now this section brings together a lot of Amos' poems
00:02:57.720 and you'll see a few key themes repeated over and over.
00:03:00.440 So first, he's constantly exposing the religious hypocrisyof Israel's wealthy and their leaders
00:03:05.950 And he describes how they faithfully attendthe religious gatherings; giving
00:03:09.690 offerings and sacrifices all the whileneglecting the poor and ignoring injustice.
00:03:15.200 And Amos says it's all a sham.
00:03:18.200 That God actually hates their worship
00:03:20.160 because it's totally disconnected from howthey treat people.
00:03:23.600 God says a real relationship with Him will transform a person's relationships
00:03:28.700 And so Amos' call to true worship is
00:03:31.200 to let justice flow like a riverand righteousness like a never failing stream.
00:03:36.400 Now these two words,they're super important for Amos
00:03:39.590 and actually all of the prophets.
00:03:41.200 So righteousness, or in Hebrew “tsedaqah",
00:03:43.819 refers to a standard of right equitablerelationships between people no matter
00:03:49.100 their social differences.
00:03:50.500 And justice or in Hebrew "mishpat" refers to concrete
00:03:54.519 actions that you take to correctinjustice and create righteousness.
00:03:58.400 And so both of these are to permeate the lifeof God's covenant people like a rushing
00:04:03.169 stream fills a dry riverbed.
00:04:05.400 The next theme isAmos' repeated accusations of
00:04:08.069 Israel's idolatry.
00:04:09.930 So remember, when the northern kingdom brokeaway from southern Judah, their king
00:04:13.690 built two new temples to rival Solomon'sin Jerusalem.
00:04:17.000 And he placed a golden calf in each (remember 1 Kings chapter 12).
00:04:21.200 Since then Israel had only accumulated more idols.
00:04:24.800 Worshiping thegods of sex
00:04:26.370 and weather and war.
00:04:27.900 And in the prophet's view,the worship of these gods always led to injustice.
00:04:33.100 Because these gods don't require the samedegree of justice and righteousness as the God of Israel.
00:04:38.700 Not to mention that these godswere immoral themselves,
00:04:41.600 not the God of Israel;He's different.
00:04:43.800 So He can say in one place,
00:04:45.910 "Seek Me that you may live."
00:04:48.000 And then rightafter that say to Israel,
00:04:50.000 "Seek good, not evil that you may live.”
00:04:53.200 So trueworship of the Creator, God of Israel,
00:04:56.900 it's synonymous with doing good, withgenerosity, and with justice.
00:05:01.000 And so the final theme in these chapters is thatbecause Israel and its king have
00:05:05.250 rejected Amos and the other prophets,God will send the day of the Lord.
00:05:10.000 This is a great and terrible act of justiceon Israel.
00:05:13.400 And specifically, Amos predicts that a powerful nation will come,
00:05:16.800 and conquer, and decimate their cities and take the people away into exile.
00:05:21.200 And we knowhis prediction came true;
00:05:23.700 some 40 years later the Assyrian Empire swoopedin and did exactly as Amos had said.
00:05:29.700 The book closes with a series of visionsthat Amos experienced;
00:05:32.700 and they're symbolic depictions of the coming day ofthe Lord.
00:05:35.600 So he sees Israel devastated by
00:05:37.470 a locust swarm. And then by a scorchingfire.
00:05:40.300 And then they're being swallowed up like over-ripe fruit.
00:05:43.700 And in the final vision,Amos sees God violently striking the
00:05:47.849 pillars of Israel's great idol temple atBethel and the whole building comes
00:05:52.539 crumbling down.
00:05:53.800 It's an image of God'sjustice on the leaders and the gods of Israel.
00:05:58.300 Their end has finally come.
00:06:00.300 But then, all of a sudden in the final paragraph
00:06:03.400 we see a glimmer of hope.
00:06:05.000 It picks up this  image of Israel as a
00:06:06.720 destroyed building.
00:06:08.000 And God says that out of the ruinsHe will one day restore the house of David.
00:06:12.400 In other words, He's goingto bring the future messianic King from David's line.
00:06:16.400 And He will rebuild thefamily of God's people; which surprisingly
00:06:20.300 we're told is going to include peoplefrom all of the nations.
00:06:24.000 All of the devastation caused by Israel's sin andGod's judgment will that day be reversed.
00:06:29.800 Now, this final paragraph issuper important.
00:06:32.000 It's the only sign of hope on the other side of judgment
00:06:35.639 And it  helps us see how this book isexploring the relationship
00:06:39.500 between God's justice and his mercy.
00:06:41.800 If God is good, He has to confront,judge evil among Israel and the nations.
00:06:46.700 But His long-term purposesare to restore his world
00:06:50.700 and building a new covenant family.
00:06:52.700 And so through Amos' words, we still today hear his call
00:06:56.100 to learn from Israel's hypocrisy anddisaster,
00:06:59.200 and to embrace a true worship of this God,
00:07:02.300 which should always lead tojustice and righteousness and loving our neighbor.
00:07:06.699 And that's what the book of Amosis all about.
