00:00:00.000 Zephaniah
00:00:00.640  
00:00:02.640 The book of the prophet
00:00:04.640 Zephaniah.
00:00:05.880 Zephaniah lived during the final decades of
00:00:07.880 the southern Kingdom of Judah.
00:00:09.880 It was when king Josiah had attempted to
00:00:11.880 bring about real change in the land by
00:00:13.880 removing idols and restoring
00:00:15.880 the temple to the worship of Israel's
00:00:17.880 God alone.
00:00:18.800 But Israel was just too far gone. Worshipping other
00:00:21.880 gods was too entrenched in the life of
00:00:23.880 the people and it ended up that Josiah's
00:00:25.880 pride led him to a tragic death
00:00:27.880 on the battlefield, as he set
00:00:29.880 Jerusalem on a collision course with
00:00:31.880 Babylon. And Zephaniah?
00:00:33.880 He had seen all of this coming.
00:00:35.880 For years he had been warning the leaders of
00:00:37.880 Jerusalem. And this little book is a
00:00:39.880 collection of his poetry summarizing
00:00:41.880 his message. It's designed to have three (3) main
00:00:43.880 parts. The first focuses on the day of
00:00:45.880 the Lord's judgement coming on Judah and
00:00:47.880 Jerusalem. The second part is about
00:00:49.880 the day of the Lord's judgement on the nations
00:00:51.880 and Jerusalem again. And then the third section
00:00:53.880 explores the hope that remains
00:00:55.880 for the nations and for Jerusalem
00:00:57.880 on the other side of God's judgement.
00:00:59.880 The first section opens with this shocking
00:01:01.880 reversal of Genesis 1.
00:01:03.880 So God's good, ordered world
00:01:05.880 is going to descend back into
00:01:07.880 disorder and darkness and chaos,
00:01:09.880 becoming uninhabitable once again.
00:01:11.880 And as you keep reading you realize
00:01:13.880 Zephaniah is developing all of these
00:01:15.920 powerful poetic images to describe
00:01:17.920 how Jerusalem's world is
00:01:19.920 going to end. All of the city's institutions
00:01:21.920 for worshipping the gods
00:01:23.920 of the Canaanites will be destroyed.
00:01:25.920 All the leaders who perpetrated injustice,
00:01:27.920 all the economic centres where
00:01:29.920 crooked lending and borrowing took place,
00:01:31.920 all of it will be gone
00:01:33.920 along with the city's walls.
00:01:35.920 Zephaniah develops these almost apocalyptic
00:01:37.920 images to show the significance
00:01:39.920 of what's going to happen. It all
00:01:41.920 refers to a great army that is coming
00:01:43.920 to take out Jerusalem.
00:01:45.920 Now it's interesting that Zephaniah never mentions
00:01:47.920 whose army God's going to use
00:01:49.920 to bring this judgement.
00:01:51.920 Now we know from the other prophets Micah or Habakkuk
00:01:53.920 that it's Babylon. But Zepheniah
00:01:55.920 never mentions that. And it's
00:01:57.920 because he wants to highlight God's role
00:01:59.920 in orchestrating the rise and fall
00:02:01.920 of the city. And actually that's what gives
00:02:03.920 Zepheniah hope. Not that
00:02:05.920 Jerusalem as a whole can avoid its fate,
00:02:07.920 but in the closing poem of section one (1)
00:02:09.919 he calls on anyone in Jerusalem
00:02:11.920 who would seek the Lord.
00:02:13.920 And he says 'These will make up the faithful
00:02:15.920 remnant, the people who could be spared
00:02:17.920 if they repent'.
00:02:19.920 In the second section Zepheniah widens his
00:02:21.920 focus to include the nations around Judah.
00:02:23.920 So the Philistines, the Moabites
00:02:25.920 the Ammonites, even the Assyrians
00:02:27.920 He accuses all of them of
00:02:29.920 corruption and violence and arrogance
00:02:31.920 and he predicts that all of them will
00:02:33.920 fall before Babylon too.
00:02:35.920 And what's shocking is that the final people group
00:02:37.920 targeted in this section
00:02:39.920 are the Israelites in Jerusalem.
00:02:41.920 It's like the leaders and prophets and
00:02:43.920 priests of Israel are so corrupt and
00:02:45.920 violent, so estranged from their God,
00:02:47.920 that He doesn't even recognize
00:02:49.920 them as His people anymore.
00:02:51.920 And so this section ends with God's final
00:02:53.920 decision. He says He's going to gather up
00:02:55.920 all the nations, including Jerusalem
00:02:57.920 and pour out His burning
00:02:59.920 indignation. God's justice
00:03:01.920 becomes this consuming fire that
00:03:03.920 devours evil from the land.
00:03:05.920 Which is really intense. And so the following
00:03:07.920 line that bring us into the final
00:03:09.920 part of the book comes as a total surprise.
00:03:11.920 We discover that this burning
00:03:13.920 fire of devine judgement is
00:03:15.920 not aimed at destroying people.
00:03:17.920 Rather its purpose is to purify
00:03:19.920 the nations, including
00:03:21.920 Jerusalem. So this section
00:03:23.920 begins as God says that He's going to
00:03:25.920 heal and transform the rebellious
00:03:27.920 nations into one unified
00:03:29.920 family. And that after being purified
00:03:31.920 they are going to turn from their evil and call
00:03:33.920 upon the name of the Lord.
00:03:35.920 These images point to the fulfillment of God's promise
00:03:37.920 to Abraham, all the way back in Genesis 12,
00:03:39.920 that God would find a way to
00:03:41.920 bless the nations. And Jerusalem
00:03:43.920 as well. The conclusion of the book
00:03:45.920 focuses on the restauration of the city
00:03:47.920 at the centre of the nations. God's
00:03:49.920 presence is there in the restored city,
00:03:51.920 along with that faithful remnant
00:03:53.920 that's been humbled and transformed
00:03:55.920 by God's mercy. And they're called to sing
00:03:57.920 and rejoice. And then in the
00:03:59.920 striking image we're told that God is
00:04:01.920 a poet who wants to sing too.
00:04:03.920 'Your God will live among you and He
00:04:05.920 will celebrate you with
00:04:07.920 songs of joy', Zepheniah says.
00:04:09.920 The closing poem of the book ends with these
00:04:11.920 very powerful images about God
00:04:13.920 gathering up into His family
00:04:15.920 the outcast and the poor and the broken,
00:04:17.920 where He exalts them into a place of
00:04:19.920 honor, and that's how the book
00:04:21.920 ends. This little book
00:04:23.920 of Zepheniah, it contains some
00:04:25.920 of the most intense images of God's
00:04:27.920 justice Ã¡nd love that
00:04:29.920 you find anywhere in the prophets.
00:04:31.920 His justice is about His passion to
00:04:33.920 protect and to rescue His world
00:04:35.920 from the horror of human evil and violence.
00:04:37.920 God won't tolerate
00:04:39.920 the horrible things that humans
00:04:41.920 do to each other and to His world.
00:04:43.920 But He brings this justice in
00:04:45.920 order to restore, in order to
00:04:47.920 create a world where people can flourish
00:04:49.920 in safety and peace, because
00:04:51.920 of His love. And so Zepheniah
00:04:53.920 forces us to hold together
00:04:55.920 these two aspects of God's character.
00:04:57.920 His justice and His love.
00:04:59.920 And he wants us to discover that
00:05:01.920 together, they contain
00:05:03.920 the future hope of our World.
00:05:05.920 And that is what the book of Zepheniah is all about.
