February 16–22. “To Be a Greater Follower of Righteousness”: Genesis 12–17; Abraham 1–2

February 16–22: “To Be a Greater Follower of Righteousness”

Genesis 12–17; Abraham 1–2
Because of the covenant God made with him, Abraham has been called “the father of the faithful” (Doctrine and Covenants 138:41) and “the Friend of God” (James 2:23). Millions today honor him as their direct ancestor, and others have been adopted into his family through conversion to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Yet Abraham himself came from a troubled family—his father, who had abandoned the true worship of God, tried to have Abraham sacrificed to false gods. In spite of this, Abraham’s desire was “to be a greater follower of righteousness” (Abraham 1:2), and the account of his life shows that God honored his desire. Abraham’s life stands as a testimony that no matter what a person’s family history has been, the future can be filled with hope.

Ideas for Learning at Home and at Church
Abraham 1:1–19

God will bless me for my faith and righteous desires.
“We are all influenced by our families [and] our culture,” Elder Neil L. Andersen taught, “and yet I believe there is a place inside of us that we uniquely and individually control and create. … Eventually, our inner desires are given life and they are seen in our choices and in our actions” (“Educate Your Desires, Elder Andersen Counsels,” ChurchofJesusChrist.org). Consider how Abraham 1:1–19 demonstrates what Elder Andersen taught. Questions like these might help:

What did Abraham desire? How were his desires evident in his actions? How did God support his desires?

What are your desires? How are they evident in your actions? How does God support you?

What message do these verses have for people whose family members do not desire righteousness?

One of Abraham and Sarah’s greatest desires—to have a child—went unfulfilled for many years (see Genesis 15:1–6). What do you learn from Hebrews 11:8–13 about how Abraham and Sarah faced this trial? How does the Savior help you “embrace” His promises, even if they are “afar off”?

Genesis 12:1–3; 13:15–16; 15:1–6; 17:1–8, 15–22; Abraham 2:6–11

seminary icon God wants me to make and keep covenants with Him.
Why is it important for you to know about the covenant God made with Abraham? Because God wants to make a similar covenant with you. He promised that this covenant would continue in Abraham’s posterity, or “seed,” and that “as many as receive this Gospel shall be … accounted thy seed” (see Abraham 2:10–11). In other words, the covenant continues in you—when you are baptized and more completely when you make covenants in the temple (see Galatians 3:26–29; Doctrine and Covenants 132:30–32).

For that reason, you might want to study Abraham 2:6–11 and make a list of what, exactly, God promised Abraham and Sarah (see also Genesis 12:1–3; 13:15–16; 15:1–6; 17:1–8, 15–22). How might these blessings apply to you?

Some of these promises have eternal parallels. How are promises like a land of inheritance or a large posterity fulfilled eternally? (see Doctrine and Covenants 131:1–4; 132:20–24, 28–32).

Besides promising blessings, God told Abraham to “be a blessing” (Genesis 12:2; emphasis added). What do you think that means? How will you be a blessing? (see Abraham 2:11).

To teach about covenants, Elder Dale G. Renlund spoke of tidal waves in the Amazon River, and President Emily Belle Freeman talked about walking a rocky path with a broken ankle (see “Accessing God’s Power through Covenants,” Liahona, May 2023, 35–37; “Walking in Covenant Relationship with Christ,” Liahona, Nov. 2023, 76–79). Search one or both of these messages for sentences that help answer the question “Why does God want me to make covenants with Him?”

Invite people to teach each other. If you’re teaching your family or a Church class about covenants, consider giving each person a portion of Elder Renlund’s or President Freeman’s message to study. Then they could share with the rest of the family or class what they learned. This allows people to testify to and learn from each other, and that invites the Spirit. (See Teaching in the Savior’s Way, 26.)

Abraham and Sarah
The Abrahamic Covenant, by Dilleen Marsh (detail)

Genesis 14:18–19; Joseph Smith Translation, Genesis 14:25–40

“Melchizedek was a man of faith.”
Imagine you were introducing Melchizedek to someone who didn’t know him. What would you say? Look for ideas in Joseph Smith Translation, Genesis 14:26–27, 33–38 (in the Bible appendix); Alma 13:13–19; Doctrine and Covenants 107:1–4. What Christlike qualities do you find in these descriptions of Melchizedek? How does your study of Melchizedek’s life affect the way you view the Melchizedek Priesthood?

Genesis 14:18–24; Joseph Smith Translation, Genesis 14:36–40

Abraham paid tithing.
What do you learn about Abraham’s attitude toward wealth from Genesis 14:18–24 and Joseph Smith Translation, Genesis 14:36–40 (in the Bible appendix)? For example, note his response to the king of Sodom in Genesis 14:23. How has obeying the law of tithing affected your view of money?

Genesis 16

God hears me.
As you read Genesis 16, you might think about a time when you felt you were being treated unfairly, as Hagar did. Note that “Ishmael” means “God hears.” How has God shown you that He has heard you?

Ideas for Teaching Children
Abraham 1:18; 2:8

Jesus Christ will lead me by the hand.
As you and your children read Abraham 1:18 and 2:8, you could invite them to listen for a part of the body that is mentioned in both verses. Maybe you could play a game in which a child closes their eyes and you lead the child somewhere by the hand. Then you could talk about how it feels to have Jesus Christ lead us by the hand or protect us.

Genesis 13:5–12

I can be a peacemaker.
Your children might enjoy acting out the story from Genesis 13:5–12, pretending to be Abraham, Lot, and the herdsmen. How can we follow Abraham’s example of being a peacemaker with our family or friends? Try role-playing their answers.

Genesis 13:16; Genesis 15:1–6; 17:1–8; Abraham 2:9–11

God wants me to make covenants with Him.
Consider showing your children a container of sand, the stars in the night sky, or the picture at the end of this outline. This could help them understand God’s promises in Genesis 13:16; 15:1–6. Talk about how you’ve learned to trust God’s promises, even when they seemed impossible.

To teach your children about covenants, ask them to tell you about a time when they made a promise or someone made a promise to them. If it’s helpful, share some examples of your own—including covenants you’ve made with God at baptism or in the temple. How have your covenants affected your relationship with God? Choose a few phrases from Genesis 15:1–6; 17:1–8; Abraham 2:9–11 to share some of the blessings God promised to Abraham and Sarah.

To help your children prepare to make a covenant with God when they are baptized, you could use some of the activity ideas suggested in appendix A or appendix B.

Abraham 1:12–17; Genesis 16:7–11

God hears me.
When Abraham’s life was in danger, he called on God. When Hagar was alone in the wilderness, she learned that God heard her. Consider sharing these two stories with your children: “Abraham and Sarah” and “Hagar” in Old Testament Stories, 28–31, 32–33. What do we learn about God from these stories? Then you could share with each other experiences when you felt that God heard you. A song like “A Child’s Prayer” (Children’s Songbook, 12–13) could reinforce this principle.
