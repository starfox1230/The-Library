July 13–19: “He Trusted in the Lord God of Israel”

2 Kings 16–25
Despite the prophet Elisha’s powerful ministry, the people of the Northern Kingdom of Israel did not repent. Eventually, the Assyrian Empire conquered and scattered the ten tribes of Israel. Meanwhile, the Southern Kingdom of Judah wasn’t doing much better: idolatry was also widespread there.

Amid all this spiritual decay, the scriptures mention two kings of Judah who, for a time, turned their people back to the Lord. One was Hezekiah. During his reign, the Assyrians conquered much of Judah. But Hezekiah and his people showed faith in the Lord, who saved Jerusalem in a miraculous way. Later, after another period of apostasy, Josiah became king. Inspired in part by a rediscovery of the book of the law of Moses, Josiah brought reforms that revived the religious life of his people.

Like Israel and Judah, we all make both good and bad choices. When we sense that our lives need some reforms, we can take encouragement from these two bright spots in the dark years of Judah’s history. Perhaps the examples of Hezekiah and Josiah can inspire us to “trust in the Lord our God” (2 Kings 18:22).

2 Kings 18–19

Most of us have experiences that challenge our faith. For Hezekiah and his people, one of those challenges came when the Assyrian army approached Jerusalem. As you read 2 Kings 18–19, imagine that you lived in Jerusalem during this time. How might you have felt, for example, hearing the Assyrians’ taunts in 2 Kings 18:28–37; 19:10–13? What would you have done? Compare the Assyrians’ reasons for the Israelites not to trust the Lord with the reasons Satan gives for us to doubt our faith today. You could also contrast the Assyrians’ reasons with your reasons why you do trust the Lord.

What do you learn from Hezekiah’s actions in this situation? (see 2 Kings 19:1–7, 14–19). How did the Lord respond? (see 2 Kings 19:35–37). Why do you think Hezekiah remained faithful? (see 2 Kings 18:5–7). Ponder how the Lord has sustained you in challenging times. What do you feel inspired to do to increase your trust in Him?

President Jeffrey R. Holland’s message “Fear Not: Believe Only!” (Liahona, May 2022, 34–36) has helpful counsel for times of fear or doubt. A hymn like “Let Us All Press On” (Hymns, no. 243) could also have encouraging messages. What do you find in these resources that helps you?

See also 2 Chronicles 31–32; 3 Nephi 3–4; Jörg Klebingat, “Valiant Discipleship in the Latter Days,” Liahona, May 2022, 107–10.

Use scripture study helps. The Church provides many resources to help you understand the scriptures. For example, in the Gospel Library you can find the Guide to the Scriptures, Topics and Questions, and Church magazines. In addition, as you read the Old Testament, you can find helpful context and insights in the “Thoughts to Keep in Mind” articles in Come, Follow Me. The article titled “Jesus Will Say to All Israel, ‘Come Home’” might help your study of 2 Kings 16–25.

2 Kings 19:20–37

All things are in the Lord’s hands.
Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, had good reason to believe that his army would conquer Jerusalem (see 2 Kings 17; 18:33–34; 19:11–13). But the Lord had a message regarding Sennacherib, given through the prophet Isaiah. It’s recorded in 2 Kings 19:20–34. What truths do you find in the Lord’s message that help you have faith in Him and His plan?

2 Kings 21–23

The scriptures can turn my heart to the Lord.
Have you ever felt that you were lacking something spiritually? Maybe you felt that your relationship with God could be stronger. What helped you turn back to Him? Ponder these questions as you read 2 Kings 21–23, which describes how the Kingdom of Judah fell away from the Lord under King Manasseh (see 2 Kings 21) and how King Josiah helped the people turn back to Him (see 2 Kings 22–23). How and why did Josiah and his people change? (see 2 Kings 22:8–11; 23:1–6, 21, 24).

President Spencer W. Kimball called the story of King Josiah “one of the finest stories in all of the scriptures” (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer W. Kimball [2006], 62). Read President Kimball’s words about King Josiah (pages 62–64). Perhaps you can think of an experience when a passage of scripture “work[ed] mightily” in you. What might you do to receive more experiences like that?

2 Kings 23:1–25

A covenant is a whole-souled commitment between me and the Lord.
What impresses you about the covenant Josiah made in 2 Kings 23:3? As you continue reading chapter 23, notice what Josiah did to show his commitment to the Lord (see also the picture at the end of this outline). How can you show your commitment to Him?

Ideas for Teaching Children
2 Kings 18:3–6; 19:14–19

I can trust Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.
In 2 Kings 18:3, 5–6, help your children discover what made Hezekiah a good king. Then as you read together 2 Kings 19:14–19, they could discover how he showed that he trusted the Lord. You could look at a picture of Jesus and talk about why we can trust Him. How can we show that we trust the Lord?

2 Kings 22:1–7

Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ can trust me.
In 2 Kings 22:1, help your children discover how old Josiah was when he became king. What do we learn about Josiah in verse 2? Consider an activity that could illustrate following the Lord and not turning “aside to the right hand or to the left.”

The workers described in 2 Kings 22:3–7 were trusted with the money to rebuild the temple “because they dealt faithfully” (verse 7). After reading these verses, you and your children could talk about things you have been trusted with. How can we be trustworthy like the workers in these verses?

2 Kings 22:8–11; 23:2–3

The scriptures teach me to follow Jesus Christ.
To introduce the story of King Josiah in 2 Kings 22–23, you could hide a copy of the scriptures somewhere in the room. Invite your children to find it. Then you could share what happened when one of Josiah’s priests found the scriptures in the temple (see 2 Kings 22:8–11; see also “King Josiah” in Old Testament Stories, 148–49). What might happen to us if we didn’t have the scriptures? Share with each other why you are glad we have the scriptures today.

King Josiah

After reading 2 Kings 23:2–3, you and your children could talk about scriptures that have inspired you to “walk after the Lord” (verse 3). You could also sing a song about the scriptures, such as “Search, Ponder, and Pray” (Children’s Songbook, 109).

2 Kings 23:1–3

I will keep my covenants with God.
When Josiah and his people learned the commandments of God, they made a covenant to live them. Read about this with your children in 2 Kings 23:1–3, and help them find words or phrases that show how the people felt about the Lord’s commandments. Maybe your children could stand and talk about what it might mean to “[stand] to the covenant.” Then they could walk in place and talk about what it might mean to “walk after the Lord.” Next, they could place their hands on their hearts and suggest ways we can keep our covenants “with all [our] heart.”
