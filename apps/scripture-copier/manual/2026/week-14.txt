March 30–April 5: “He Will Swallow Up Death in Victory”

Easter
The life of Jesus Christ “is central to all human history” (“The Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles,” Gospel Library). What does that mean? In part, it means that the Savior’s life influences the eternal destiny of everyone who has ever lived or ever will live. You might also say that the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, on that first Easter Sunday, connects all of God’s people throughout history: those who were born before His Resurrection looked forward to it with faith (see Jacob 4:4), and those born after look back on it with faith. As we read Old Testament accounts and prophecies, we don’t ever see the name Jesus Christ, but we do see the evidence of the ancient believers’ faith in and longing for their Messiah and Redeemer. So we who are invited to remember Him can feel a connection with those who looked forward to Him. For truly Jesus Christ has borne “the iniquity of us all” (Isaiah 53:6; emphasis added), and “in Christ shall all be made alive” (1 Corinthians 15:22; emphasis added).

Easter is a joyful time, because it’s a time to celebrate the Savior’s Atonement and Resurrection. And yet, even during Easter, there are many people who don’t feel joyful for various reasons. What can you do to spread the Savior’s peace and joy this Easter?

One idea is to find messages in the scriptures about the peace and joy Jesus Christ offers, like these: Psalms 16:8–11; 30:2–5; Isaiah 12; 25:8–9; 40:28–31; John 14:27; 16:33; Alma 26:11–22. Consider how you might share these messages with others. For example, maybe you could create Easter cards to share, based on these messages. Be prayerful about who needs to receive your Easter greeting. You might also decide to share your messages on social media, where many people can see them.

Hymns about Christ and the Resurrection, such as “He Is Risen!” (Hymns, no. 199), can also help us feel peace and joy at Easter. Look for phrases in the hymn that, in your opinion, capture the joy of Easter.

Because of His Atonement, Jesus Christ has the power to help me overcome sin, death, trials, and weaknesses.
Here’s an activity that can help you see the many blessings that come through Jesus Christ and His Atonement. Read the scriptures below about what Jesus Christ helps us overcome. Try sorting the passages into these categories: sin, death, trials, and weaknesses (some passages may fit in more than one category). As you read, what impressions do you have about the Savior’s power?

Isaiah 61:1–3

Ezekiel 36:26–28

Matthew 11:28–30

Luke 1:46–55

How would you explain to a friend who isn’t a Christian why Jesus Christ is important to you? Elder Ahmad S. Corbitt’s message “Do You Know Why I as a Christian Believe in Christ?” (Liahona, May 2023, 119–21) can help.

Ideas for Teaching Children
Jesus Christ suffered and died for me.
The week of Easter is a good time to teach your children about what the Savior did for us in Gethsemane and on the cross. You could start by showing them the pictures below and letting them talk about what’s happening in the pictures. While your children are looking at the pictures, you could read verses that describe these events (see Matthew 26:36–46; 27:35–50; Luke 22:39–46; John 19:16–30). Your children could point out details in the pictures that they hear in the verses.

How are we blessed because of Jesus’s sacrifice for us? Help your children look for words and phrases that answer this question in Isaiah 53:4–12; Alma 7:11–13; and Doctrine and Covenants 19:16–19. Share with each other how you feel about the Savior after reading these scriptures.

Jesus Christ was resurrected for me.
You could use this week’s activity page or other pictures in this outline to tell your children the story of the Resurrection (see also “Jesus Is Risen,” in New Testament Stories, 139–44). Then let your children tell the story back to you.

Consider how you will help your children find joy in Christ this Easter. For example, you could sing together a favorite Easter hymn, such as “Christ the Lord Is Risen Today” (Hymns, no. 200) or “Gethsemane” (Gospel Library). To find other songs about the Resurrection, you could look in the topical index of Hymns and Children’s Songbook. You and your children could share with each other why you like these songs and how you feel when you sing them. What do these songs teach us about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ?

Children can feel the Spirit but may need help recognizing His influence. “Teach children about the different ways the Spirit communicates with us. Help them recognize His voice as He speaks to them. This will help them develop a habit of seeking and acting on personal revelation throughout their lives” (Teaching in the Savior’s Way, 32). For example, as you sing songs about the Savior with your children, look at pictures of Him, or read stories about Him, share with each other the spiritual feelings you have.

Gospel Library has a collection of Easter videos that your children might enjoy. Maybe you could let them pick one to watch. Ask them what they learn about Jesus Christ from the video. You might also ask them to summarize the message of the video in one sentence.

Prophets testify of Jesus Christ and His Atonement.
As you and your children watch general conference together this Easter weekend, help them notice when the Savior’s special witnesses bear testimony of the Resurrection. Perhaps you could make a game of it—invite them to stand every time they hear words like Easter or Atonement or Resurrection. Share with each other why you’re grateful for the living prophets’ testimonies of the Savior.
