September 28–October 4: “Comfort Ye My People”

Isaiah 40–49
“Comfort” is the first word of Isaiah chapter 40. It marks the beginning of a different tone, a different emphasis in the prophet’s message. Isaiah’s earlier writings warned Israel and Judah about destruction and captivity that would come because of their sins. But these later prophecies were meant to comfort the Jewish people over 150 years in the future—after Jerusalem and the temple were destroyed and the people were taken captive by Babylon. These prophecies, however, reach even further into the future than to the defeated, disheartened Israelites. They speak to us, who also sometimes feel defeated, disheartened, and even lost.

Isaiah’s message to his people and to us is simple: “Fear not” (Isaiah 43:1). All is not lost. The Lord has not forgotten you, and He has power over situations that seem out of your control. Isn’t the Lord, who “created the heavens” (Isaiah 42:5), more powerful than Babylon, than sin, than whatever is holding you captive? “Return unto me,” He pleads, “for I have redeemed thee” (Isaiah 44:22). He can heal, restore, strengthen, forgive, and comfort—whatever is needed for you, in your case, to be redeemed.

Isaiah 40–49

seminary iconJesus Christ can comfort me and give me hope.
When the Israelites were captives in Babylon, many may have wondered if they had forever lost their place as God’s chosen, covenant people. As you read Isaiah 40–49, look for passages that might have provided comfort and hope. For each passage you find, ponder and record what the Lord might be saying to you in these verses. Here are a few you might start with:

40:11, 29–31: 

41:10–13, 17–18: 

42:6–7: 

43:1–7, 25: 

44:1–4, 21–24: 

46:3–4: 

49:7–16: 

What do you feel the Lord wants you to know about Him?

You might notice that the hymn “How Firm a Foundation” (Hymns, no. 85) draws on Isaiah’s words in Isaiah 41:10; 43:2–5; 46:4. Consider singing or listening to this hymn, looking for parallels between the lyrics and these verses from Isaiah. How has the Lord fulfilled the promises in these verses in your life?

See also Patrick Kearon, “He Is Risen with Healing in His Wings: We Can Be More Than Conquerors,” Liahona, May 2022, 37–40.

Use additional scripture. Sometimes we can understand the Old Testament better if we supplement our study with verses from the Book of Mormon. For example, the Book of Mormon prophets Nephi and Jacob had access to the writings of Isaiah on the plates of brass (see 1 Nephi 19:22–23), and they used these prophecies to teach about the Savior. To learn how Nephi and Jacob likened Isaiah 48–49 to their people, see 1 Nephi 22. That may help you liken these chapters to your own life.

A wide, shallow river
By obeying the Lord, we can have “peace … as a river” (Isaiah 48:18).

Isaiah 40–49

“Thou art my servant.”
Throughout Isaiah 40–49 the Lord speaks of His “servant” and His “witnesses.” These words can refer to Jesus Christ (see Isaiah 42:1–7), to the house of Israel (see Isaiah 45:4), and to King Cyrus, who allowed the Jewish people to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple (see Isaiah 44:26–28; 45:1–4). You might also consider how the passages apply to you as a servant and a witness of the Lord. For example, ponder questions like these:

Isaiah 40:1–3, 9–11; 43:9–12. In what sense are you a witness of Jesus Christ? What are the “good tidings” that you can share as His witness? You might imagine that you have been called to the witness stand in a court trial. In this trial, Jesus Christ has been charged with making the claim recorded in Isaiah 43:11. What testimony could you give in support of Jesus’s claim? What evidence from your life would you present?

Isaiah 41:8–13; 42:6; 44:21. What has the Lord called you to do? Consider Church callings as well as other opportunities to serve Him. How has He “formed” or prepared you to become His servant? How does He support you as you serve?

Isaiah 49:1–9. What messages do you find in these verses that can help when your efforts and service seem to be “for nought, and in vain”? (verse 4).

Isaiah 40:3–8, 15–23; 42:15–16; 47:7–11

God’s power is greater than worldly power.
Isaiah repeatedly reminded his people of God’s matchless power, even compared to the oppressive worldly power that surrounded them. Look for this message as you read Isaiah 40:3–8, 15–23; 42:15–16; and 47:7–11 (note that chapter 47 is addressed to Israel’s captor, Babylon). What do these passages teach you about worldly things? What do they teach you about God? Ponder why this message might have been valuable to Jewish people in captivity. Why is it valuable to you?

Isaiah 48:10; 49:13–16

The Lord can refine me through my afflictions.
As you read Isaiah 48:10, ponder your own “furnace of affliction.” How is the Lord “refining” you? How does Isaiah 49:13–16 help you when you suffer afflictions?

Ideas for Teaching Children
Isaiah 40:3–5

I can help prepare “the way of the Lord.”
Think of some ways to illustrate what it might mean to “prepare … the way of the Lord,” as described in Isaiah 40:3–5. For example, you and your children could straighten something that’s crooked, clear a cluttered floor, or make a clear path in rocky ground. You could also show pictures of John the Baptist and Joseph Smith (see Gospel Art Book, nos. 35, 87). How did they prepare the way for the Lord’s coming? (see Luke 3:2–18; Doctrine and Covenants 135:3). How can we help? This might be an opportunity to talk about how Aaronic Priesthood holders help prepare the way of the Lord (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:26–28).

Isaiah 43:10

I can be a witness of the Lord.
After reading Isaiah 43:10 together, you could talk about what it means to be a witness. Share with each other things you have experienced that you can be a “witness” of—for example, a food you have tasted, a place you have visited, or a person you know. What does it mean to be the Lord’s witness? What can we tell other people about Him?

Isaiah 44:3–4; 45:8

The Lord will “pour” His blessings on me.
After reading these verses, your children could water a plant and talk about blessings the Lord has poured out on them. What happens to a plant when we water it? How have the Lord’s blessings helped us grow?

Our “righteousness [can be] as the waves of the sea” (Isaiah 48:18).

Isaiah 48:17–18

Keeping God’s commandments brings peace.
Pictures or videos of rivers and ocean waves could help your children visualize Isaiah 48:18 (such as the pictures in this outline). Your children might enjoy moving their hands and arms like a river and waves of the sea. How can peace be like a river? How can righteousness be like waves? Talk about how keeping God’s commandments has helped you feel peaceful like a river or strong like a wave.

Sing together a song about commandments, such as “Keep the Commandments” (Children’s Songbook, 146–47). What does this song teach about why we should keep God’s commandments?

Isaiah 49:14–16

The Lord will never forget me.
Isaiah 49:14–16 can be a great comfort to your children for years to come. As you read verse 14, you could talk about what might make people feel forgotten or forsaken. How do we know the Lord has not forgotten us?

To introduce verses 15–16, you could ask your children about someone who they will never forget, like a family member or friend. According to Isaiah 49:15–16, why will the Lord never forget us? Then you could share with each other your feelings about Jesus Christ.
