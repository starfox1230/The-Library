January 12–18: “In the Beginning God Created the Heaven and the Earth”

Genesis 1–2; Moses 2–3; Abraham 4–5
Because the world around us is so beautiful and majestic, it’s hard to imagine the earth when it was “without form, and void” and “empty and desolate” (Genesis 1:2; Abraham 4:2). One thing the Creation story teaches us is that God can, over time, make something magnificent out of something unorganized. That’s helpful to remember when life seems chaotic. Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are Creators, and Their creative work with us is not finished. They can make light shine in dark moments in our lives. They can fill our emptiness with life. They can transform us into the divine beings we were meant to be. That’s what it means to be created in God’s image, after His likeness (see Genesis 1:26). We have the potential to become like Him: exalted, glorified, heavenly.

For an overview of the book of Genesis, see “Genesis” in the Bible Dictionary.

“By mine Only Begotten I created these things.”
Although we don’t know everything about how the world was created, it’s interesting to note what God has chosen to reveal about the Creation. What does God teach you about it in Genesis 1:1–25; Moses 2:1–25; and Abraham 4:1–25? Why does He want you to know these things? As you ponder these accounts, you might also consider what they teach you about Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, the world, and yourself.

To enrich your study, consider reading these verses while out among God’s creations or while listening to a song like “All Creatures of Our God and King” (Hymns, no. 62). You could find pictures of His creations that help you feel reverence for the Creator. Consider sharing these pictures, along with your testimony, with others.

As you read Genesis 1:26–27; Moses 2:26–27; and Abraham 4:26–27, ponder what it means to be created in God’s “image” or “likeness,” male and female. Why is it important to you to know the truths in these verses? For example, how do these truths affect the way you see yourself, others, and God? How can they help you when you have negative feelings about yourself?

To help you think about these questions, try completing a sentence like this one: “Because I know I am created in God’s image, I choose to …” Reviewing “Your body is sacred” in For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices (pages 22–29) can help. Consider choosing something you will do to show God that you know your body is sacred.

In the video “God’s Greatest Creation” (Gospel Library), President Russell M. Nelson bears testimony of the miraculous human body. As you watch this video, ask yourself, “How does Heavenly Father want me to feel about my body?” How is this different from messages you might hear from others?

God's Greatest Creation

Some people might say that being created in God’s image means that all of our thoughts, feelings, and desires are approved by Him and that we don’t need to (or cannot) improve. What would you say to that? What insights do you gain from Mosiah 3:19 and Ether 12:27?

Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God.
“Adam and Eve were joined together in marriage for time and for all eternity by the power of [the] everlasting priesthood” (Russell M. Nelson, “Lessons from Eve,” Ensign, Nov. 1987, 87). Ponder this as you read Genesis 1:27–28; 2:18–25; Moses 3:18, 21–25; and Abraham 5:14–19. How can you treat marriage with the sacredness God has given it?

I am responsible for caring for God’s creations.
What do Genesis 1:28; Moses 2:28; and Abraham 4:28 suggest about our responsibility toward God’s creations? What do Doctrine and Covenants 59:16–21 and 104:13–18 add to your understanding?

God blessed and sanctified the Sabbath day.
God made the Sabbath day holy, and He asks us to keep it holy. As you read Genesis 2:2–3; Moses 3:2–3; and Abraham 5:2–3, think about what makes the Sabbath “blessed” to you.

Ideas for Teaching Children
Genesis 1:1–25; Moses 2:1–25; Abraham 4:1–25

Jesus created the earth.
How will you make learning about the Creation fun for your children? You could take them on a search outside for the kinds of things that were made during each period of Creation. Your children might also look at pictures of things Jesus created (see “The Creation of the Earth” in Old Testament Stories, 8–12). Then you and your children could talk about how you feel about Jesus Christ after reading about the Creation.

Consider singing a song together about our beautiful world, such as “My Heavenly Father Loves Me” (Children’s Songbook, 228–29). Maybe your children could add to the song other things God has created that help them feel His love.

Help children express their creativity. “When you invite children to draw, build, color, or write something related to a gospel principle, you help them better understand the principle and you give them a tangible reminder of what they have learned” (Teaching in the Savior’s Way, 32).

Genesis 1:26–27; Moses 2:26–27; Abraham 4:26–27

I was created in God’s image.
Your children can develop a sense of reverence and respect for their own and others’ bodies as they learn that we were all created in God’s image. To help them understand what this means, you could let your children look at their image in a mirror or picture while you read Moses 2:26–27 to them. You could also show them how baby animals are often in the “likeness” of their parents (see the picture in this outline, for example). This could lead to a conversation about why it’s important to you to know that you are created in your Heavenly Father’s image.

You and your children might enjoy drawing a human body and cutting the drawings into puzzles. As your children put their puzzles together, they could talk about ways they can show Heavenly Father that they are thankful for their bodies.

Genesis 2:2–3; Moses 3:2–3; Abraham 5:2–3

The Sabbath day is holy.
As you read Moses 3:2–3, ask your children to listen for what God did on the seventh day. Help your children find or draw pictures of things they can do on Sunday to make it a holy day and different from other days. Share with each other why it is important to you to keep the Sabbath day holy.

Help your children role-play explaining to a friend why they choose to do things on Sunday that honor Heavenly Father and Jesus. Suggest that they use Genesis 2:2–3 in their explanations. How does keeping the Sabbath day holy show our love for Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ?
