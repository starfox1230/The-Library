October 12–18. “The Redeemer Shall Come to Zion”: Isaiah 58–66

October 12–18: “The Redeemer Shall Come to Zion”

Isaiah 58–66
Early in His ministry, Jesus Christ visited a synagogue in Nazareth, where He was raised. He stood there to read from the scriptures, opened the book of Isaiah, and read what we now know as Isaiah 61:1–2. He then announced, “This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.” This was one of the Savior’s most straightforward declarations that He was the Anointed One, who would “heal the brokenhearted” and “preach deliverance to the captives” (see Luke 4:16–21). This scripture was indeed fulfilled on that day. And, like many other prophecies of Isaiah, it is also being fulfilled in our day. The Savior continues to heal the brokenhearted who come unto Him. There are still many captives who need deliverance. And there is a glorious future to prepare for—a time when the Lord will “create new heavens and a new earth” (Isaiah 65:17) and “cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations” (Isaiah 61:11). Reading Isaiah opens our eyes to what the Lord has already done, what He is doing, and what He will yet do for His people.

Ideas for Learning at Home and at Church
Isaiah 58:3–12

seminary iconFasting builds spiritual power and blesses people in need.
Why would anyone voluntarily go without food when food is available? As you study Isaiah 58:3–12, you might think about your reasons for fasting—as well as the Lord’s reasons for giving this law. Here are some other questions to ponder:

Why can fasting sometimes be perceived like more of a burden than a blessing? (see Isaiah 58:3–5). How do the Lord’s teachings in this chapter change that perception for you?

What might it mean to “loose the bands of wickedness” and “break every yoke”? (Isaiah 58:6). How can fasting bless others? (see verse 7).

How has fasting brought you the blessings described in Isaiah 58:8–12?

In his message “Is Not This the Fast That I Have Chosen?” (Ensign or Liahona, May 2015, 22–25), President Henry B. Eyring shared several examples of how people have been blessed by fasting and fast offerings. How have you witnessed similar blessings in your life?

See also “Bless Our Fast, We Pray,” Hymns, no. 138; Topics and Questions, “Fasting and Fast Offerings,” Gospel Library.

Get to know the people you teach. “Being a Christlike teacher includes getting to know the people you teach and striving to understand what is in their hearts. … You can find out how they learn best. You can ask questions, listen carefully, and observe. Above all, you can pray for the understanding that only the Spirit can give. The better you know a person, the better able you are to help him or her find personal meaning and power in the gospel of Jesus Christ. Once you understand a person’s thirst, the Spirit can teach you how to help quench it with the Savior’s living water” (Teaching in the Savior’s Way, 13).

Isaiah 58:13–14

Honoring the Lord on the Sabbath brings joy.
Is the Sabbath day “a delight” for you? As you study Isaiah 58:13–14, consider how you could find more delight in the Lord’s day. For example, what might it mean to turn “from doing thy pleasure on [His] holy day”? What is the difference between “[delighting] thyself in the Lord” and “doing thine own ways”?

See also Russell M. Nelson, “The Sabbath Is a Delight,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2015, 129–32.

Isaiah 59:9–21; 61:1–3; 63:7–9

Jesus Christ is my Savior and Redeemer.
Isaiah 58–66 has multiple references to the atoning mission of Jesus Christ. Look for them as you study. In particular, note the titles and words used to describe the Savior. For example:

What impresses you about the description of the “intercessor” in Isaiah 59:16–21? How does the Savior overcome the conditions described in verses 9–15?

When Jesus Christ announced to the people of Nazareth that He was the Messiah, He quoted from Isaiah 61:1–3 (see Luke 4:16–21; see also the video “Jesus Declares He Is the Messiah,” Gospel Library). How has Jesus Christ blessed you and others in the ways described in these verses? How has He given beauty in place of ashes?

What “lovingkindnesses of the Lord” can you “mention”? (see Isaiah 63:7–9).

What other references to the Savior do you find in Isaiah 58–66?

Isaiah 60; 62

“The Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light.”
Isaiah 60 and 62 speak of light and dark, eyes and seeing to teach about how the gospel of Jesus Christ will bless the world in the last days. Look for these concepts in Isaiah 60:1–5, 19–20; 62:1–2. As you read these chapters, ponder how God is gathering His children out of darkness to His light. What is your role in this work?

See also 1 Nephi 22:3–12; 3 Nephi 18:24; Doctrine and Covenants 14:9; Bonnie H. Cordon, “That They May See,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2020, 78–80.

Isaiah 64:1–5; 65:17–25; 66

Christ will reign on earth during the Millennium.
Isaiah spoke of a day when “the former troubles are forgotten” (Isaiah 65:16). While this prophecy has several fulfillments, in its fullest sense, that day is yet to come—when Jesus Christ will return. Isaiah described this future day in Isaiah 64:1–5; 65:17–25; 66. Notice how often he used words like “rejoice” and “rejoicing.” Why will the Savior’s return be a day of rejoicing for you? What can you do to prepare for His coming?

Ideas for Teaching Children
Isaiah 58:6–11

Fasting blesses me and others in need.
Perhaps the best way to encourage your children to fast—when they are ready—is to help them understand the Lord’s purposes for this law. Consider reading together Isaiah 58:6–11 to find answers to these questions: Why do we fast? How do we fast? You could also look in “Fast, Fasting” in the Guide to the Scriptures.

If you have had a meaningful experience with fasting, share it with your children. You could also ask them how they would explain to a friend why the Lord gave us this law.

Isaiah 58:13–14

The Sabbath can be a delight to me.
After reading Isaiah 58:13–14, you could point to the days of the week on a calendar and invite your children to say the days with you. When you get to the Sabbath, ask them to call that day “a delight.” Tell them why the Sabbath is a delight to you.

Share with each other ways you can “delight thyself in the Lord” on the Sabbath. Maybe your children could draw their ideas and put them in a “box of Sabbath delights.” Then, when they need ideas about things to do on the Sabbath, they could pull an idea from the box.

Isaiah 60:1–3

The Savior is like a light for me.
You could invite your children to close their eyes as you read Isaiah 60:1–3. Ask them to open their eyes when they hear the word “light” and close them again when they hear the word “darkness.” Explain that Jesus Christ and His gospel are like a light that helps us see our way back to Heavenly Father.

Isaiah 65:17–25

When Jesus comes again, He will bring peace and joy.
Isaiah 65:17–25 describes what the earth will be like when the Savior comes again. As you read these verses with your children, help them look for how life will be different in the “new earth” Isaiah described. Why will this be a time to be “glad and rejoice for ever”? (verse 18).

You could also sing together a song about the Second Coming, such as “When the Savior Comes Again” (Gospel Library). Share with each other what you are looking forward to about the Savior’s return. What can we do to prepare for that day?

For more, see this month’s issue of the Friend magazine.
