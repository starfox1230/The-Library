August 17–23: “The Lord Is My Shepherd”

Psalms 1–2; 8; 19–33; 40; 46
We don’t know for certain who wrote the Psalms. Some are attributed to King David, but for most of them, the writers remain anonymous. Yet after reading the Psalms, we feel as if we know the hearts of the psalmists, even if we don’t know their names. We do know that the Psalms were an important part of worship among the Israelites, and we know that the Savior quoted them often. In the Psalms, we get a window into the soul of God’s ancient people. We see how they felt about God, what they worried about, and how they found peace. As believers today, all over the world, we still use these words in our worship of God. It’s almost like the writers of the Psalms had a window into our souls, because they expressed how we feel about God, what we worry about, and how we find peace.

For an overview of the book of Psalms, see “Psalms” in the Bible Dictionary.

Ideas for Learning at Home and at Church
Psalms 1; 23; 26–28; 46

“I have trusted … in the Lord.”
As you read the Psalms, you might notice how often the writers express fear, sorrow, or anxiety. Such feelings are normal, even for people of faith. But what makes the Psalms inspiring is that they also offer inspiring solutions, including complete trust in the Lord. As you read Psalms 1; 23; 26–28; 46, write down:

Invitations to trust the Lord.

Words that describe Him.

Words that describe the peace, strength, and other blessings He provides.

Words that describe people who trust Him.

Also watch for the vivid imagery and symbols that the Psalms use to teach about the Savior. For example, in Psalm 23, what do phrases like “lie down in green pastures” or “still waters” (verse 2) bring to mind? What could the comforting “rod” and “staff” (verse 4) symbolize? What might it mean for our “cup” (verse 5) to run over?

Psalms 2; 22

Jesus Christ is the promised Messiah.
Several of the psalms point to the mortal life of Jesus Christ. Christians in New Testament times saw these connections too. Consider reading the following scripture references. Look for connections between the words in these psalms and the life of the Savior:

Psalm 2:1–3 and Acts 4:24–28

Psalm 2:7 and Acts 13:30–33

Psalm 22:1 and Matthew 27:45–46

Psalm 22:7–8 and Matthew 27:39–43

Psalm 22:16 and Luke 23:32–33

Psalm 22:18 and Matthew 27:35

Psalm 31:5 and Luke 23:46

What do you learn from studying these connections? What scriptural prophecies and promises haven’t been fulfilled yet? What do you find in these promises that gives you hope for the future?

Psalms 8; 19; 33

“The earth is full of the goodness of the Lord.”
Reading Psalms 8; 19; 33 might inspire you to consider the Lord’s many wonderful creations. Pay attention to your feelings as you do. You might also want to sing or ponder the words of a song related to these psalms, such as “How Great Thou Art” (Hymns, 86). How do the Lord’s creations “declare the glory of God” to you? (Psalm 19:1).

Here are some other hymns inspired by the Psalms:

Psalm 23: “The Lord Is My Shepherd” (Hymns, no. 108)

Psalms 23:6; 150: “Praise to the Lord, the Almighty” (Hymns, no. 72)

Psalm 26:8: “We Love Thy House, O God” (Hymns, no. 247)

Psalm 27:1: “The Lord Is My Light” (Hymns, no. 89)

Psalms 33:1–6; 95:1–6: “For the Beauty of the Earth” (Hymns, no. 92)

Psalm 37:3–9: “Be Still, My Soul” (Hymns, no. 124)

Psalm 148: “All Creatures of Our God and King” (Hymns, no. 62)

Use music. President Dallin H. Oaks said: “The singing of hymns is one of the best ways to put ourselves in tune with the Spirit of the Lord. … Sacred music has a unique capacity to communicate our feelings of love for the Lord. This kind of communication is a wonderful aid to our worship. … Our hymns contain matchless doctrinal sermons, surpassed only by the scriptures in their truth and poetic impact” (“Worship through Music,” Ensign, Nov. 1994, 10, 11). What hymns related to the Psalms could you listen to or sing to enhance your worship this week?

Psalms 19:7–11; 29

The word of the Lord is powerful, “rejoicing the heart.”
In the Psalms, words like testimony, statutes, commandment, and judgments can refer to the word of the Lord. Keep that in mind as you read Psalm 19:7–11. What do these verses suggest to you about the word of the Lord? What does Psalm 29 teach you about His voice? In your experience, how has the word or voice of the Lord matched these descriptions?

Psalms 24; 26–27

seminary iconThe Savior can help me be pure so I can enter God’s presence.
Because the temple at Jerusalem was built on a hill, the phrase “hill of the Lord” (Psalm 24:3) could refer to the temple or to the presence of God. What does this add to your understanding of Psalm 24? What does it mean to you to have “clean hands, and a pure heart”? (verse 4). As you read Psalms 26–27, what else do you learn about the house of the Lord?

At times, we might be discouraged to hear that we need to be pure to enter the presence of God. After all, we all struggle, and none of us are perfect. What hope do you find in Elder David A. Bednar’s message “Clean Hands and a Pure Heart”? (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2007, 80–83). How could you use his message to help someone who feels overwhelmed with wanting to be perfect? Consider how you can receive the Savior’s help in your efforts to have “clean hands, and a pure heart.”

Ideas for Teaching Children
Psalms 23; 27–28; 32; 46

The Lord offers me peace, strength, and guidance.
Consider writing The Lord is … Invite your children to look for ways to complete that sentence using scriptures like these: Psalms 23:1; 27:1; 28:1; 28:7; 32:7; 46:1. What do these verses teach us about how the Lord can help us?

You could discuss with your children what a lamb needs to be safe and healthy. Then, as you read together Psalm 23, help your children compare what a shepherd does for a lamb with what Jesus does for us. What do we need to be spiritually safe and healthy? Sing together a song that could give them ideas, such as “I Feel My Savior’s Love” (Children’s Songbook, 74–75).

Psalm 24:3–4

To enter the temple, we need “clean hands, and a pure heart.”
As you read Psalm 24:3 together, your children could look for words that remind them of the temple. They could also look at a picture of a temple. Then you could read together verse 4 to learn who can enter the temple. You could talk about how hands get dirty and how we clean them. How do we get spiritually dirty? How does the Savior help clean us spiritually?

Psalm 30:5

Jesus Christ can turn sadness into joy.
If you have young children, you could invite them to pretend to cry while you read from Psalm 30:5, “Weeping may endure for a night.” Then ask them to express joy as you read, “But joy cometh in the morning.” Repeat this phrase a few times.

Show a picture of the Savior, and tell your children what He has done for you that brings you joy. You could also give each child a turn to hold the picture and share what Jesus has done that brings them joy.

Psalm 46:10

“Be still, and know that I am God.”
Help your children memorize the first line from Psalm 46:10: “Be still, and know that I am God.” What could it mean to “be still”? Maybe you could spend some time practicing being still. You could also share with each other experiences when being “still” strengthened your relationship with God. Help your children think of times during the day when they can “be still” to feel close to Heavenly Father.
