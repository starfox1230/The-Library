September 21–27. “A Marvellous Work and a Wonder”: Isaiah 13–14; 22; 24–30; 35








God and Jesus Christ appearing to a young Joseph Smith
Sacred Grove, by Brent Borup

September 21–27: “A Marvellous Work and a Wonder”

Isaiah 13–14; 22; 24–30; 35
One thing that the Lord asks prophets to do is to warn about the consequences of sin. For Old Testament prophets, this often meant telling the rulers of mighty kingdoms that they needed to repent. It was a dangerous task, but Isaiah was fearless, and his warnings to the kingdoms of his day—including Israel, Judah, and surrounding nations—were bold (see Isaiah 13–23).

However, Isaiah also had a message of hope. Even though the prophesied destructions did come upon these kingdoms, Isaiah foresaw a chance for restoration and renewal. The Lord would invite His people to return to Him. He would make “the parched ground … become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water” (Isaiah 35:7). He would perform “a marvellous work and a wonder” (Isaiah 29:14), restoring to Israel the blessings He had promised them. Neither Isaiah nor anyone else alive at that time lived to see this marvelous work. But we are seeing it today. In fact, we are part of it.

Ideas for Learning at Home and at Church
Isaiah 13:1–11, 19–22; 14:1–20

Pride and worldliness will fail.
In Isaiah’s day, Babylon was a mighty kingdom with a powerful ruler. Now Babylon is ancient history. So why is Isaiah’s message to Babylon, in Isaiah 13–14, important to us today? Because Babylon symbolizes pride, greed, and sin, things that still surround us today. Think about this symbolism as you read Isaiah 13:1–11, 19–22; 14:1–20. You might consider questions like these:

What similarities do you see between the pride of the Babylonian king and the pride of Satan? (see Isaiah 14:4–20; Moses 4:1–4). What warnings do you find for yourself in these verses?

How does the Savior provide “rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear”? (Isaiah 14:3).

“He will swallow up death in victory” (Isaiah 25:8).

Isaiah 22:22–23; 24:21–23; 25:6–8; 26:19; 28:16

Jesus Christ is the promised Messiah.
The teachings of Isaiah often refer to the Savior’s mission, including His atoning sacrifice, Resurrection, and Second Coming. What aspects of His mission come to mind as you read these verses: Isaiah 22:22–23; 24:21–23; 25:6–8; 26:19; 28:16? What other passages do you find that remind you of the Savior?

Give learners opportunities to bear testimony of Jesus Christ. “To be a teacher of Jesus Christ’s gospel means to help others understand and rely on His teachings, redeeming power, and perfect love” (Teaching in the Savior’s Way, 8). One simple way to do that every time you teach is to ask a question like “What did you find in the scriptures this week that taught you something about the Savior?” Then let learners share their experiences and strengthen each other’s faith.

Isaiah 24:1–12; 28:1–8; 29:7–13; 30:8–14

Turning away from the Lord brings spiritual danger.
In His mercy, the Lord sent Isaiah to warn the covenant people that they were straying from Him. See if you can find the spiritual warning signs of this in Isaiah 24:5; 29:13; 30:8–12. Why are these attitudes and actions spiritually dangerous?

To warn about the consequences of turning away from the Lord, Isaiah used some memorable comparisons. As you study them, ask yourself how turning away from the Lord is like:

A sad, empty earth (Isaiah 24:1–12).

Drunkenness (Isaiah 28:7–8).

Hunger and thirst (Isaiah 29:7–10).

A broken wall or vessel (Isaiah 30:13–14).

Why is it important to you to stay close to the Lord?

Isaiah 29; 30:18–26; 35

seminary iconThe Lord can restore what is lost or broken.
Have you ever lost something that you thought you would never find again? Or maybe something broke, and you worried that it could never be repaired. When we turn away from the Lord, Satan wants us to think that we can never return or be healed. However, Isaiah described some of the marvelous things the Lord will do to help us return to Him. What do you learn from Isaiah 29:13–24; 30:18–26; 35 about the Lord, His love, and His power? Perhaps you could find a phrase in these passages that gives you hope when you need healing. You could also look in Sister Amy A. Wright’s message “Christ Heals That Which Is Broken” (Liahona, May 2022, 81–84).

One way the Lord manifests His power and mercy is through the Restoration of His gospel. Isaiah 29 contains several passages that have parallels with events of the Restoration. For example:

Compare Isaiah 29:11–12 with 2 Nephi 27:6–26 and Joseph Smith—History 1:63–65.

Compare Isaiah 29:13–14 with Doctrine and Covenants 4 and Joseph Smith—History 1:17–19.

Compare Isaiah 29:18–24 with the title page of the Book of Mormon.

In your opinion, why are “marvellous” and “wonder” (Isaiah 29:14) good words to describe the Lord restoring His gospel? How can you help fulfill the prophecies about the Restoration? For ideas, look in Elder Gerrit W. Gong’s message “All Nations, Kindreds, and Tongues” (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2020, 38–41).

See also “The Restoration of the Fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ: A Bicentennial Proclamation to the World” (Gospel Library); “The Morning Breaks,” Hymns, no 1.

Ideas for Teaching Children
Isaiah 14:3; 25:8–9; 28:16

Jesus Christ can save me from sin and death.
How will you help your children see the Savior in the writings of Isaiah? You might help them find phrases that remind them of Him in Isaiah 14:3; 25:8; or 28:16. They could also match these verses from Isaiah with other verses that teach about the Savior, such as Matthew 11:28–30; 1 Corinthians 15:53–57; Helaman 5:12. What great things has the Lord done for us?

After reading Isaiah 25:8–9 together, you could look at pictures of the Savior in Gethsemane, on the cross, and after His Resurrection. Let your children talk about what is happening in the pictures and why they love Jesus and “rejoice in his salvation” (verse 9).

You might choose to tell your children about the sadness you felt when someone you love passed away. Testify of the comfort you receive because of Jesus Christ. Maybe your children could draw a crying face and then erase the tears as you read Isaiah 25:8 together.

Thy Will Be Done, by Ken Spencer

Isaiah 25:4–6

Jesus gives me “refuge from the storm.”
Have you and your children ever experienced the blessing of safe shelter during a storm or shade on a hot summer day? Or have you enjoyed a good meal when you were hungry? Talk about these experiences as you read Isaiah 25:4–6. How is Jesus like these things?

Isaiah 29:11–18, 24

The Restoration of the gospel is a “marvellous work.”
As you and your children read Isaiah 29:14, share with them other words that mean the same thing as “marvellous” and “wonder.” Let them help you find objects or pictures that represent some of the Lord’s marvelous works during the latter days. These might include a copy of the Book of Mormon, a picture of a temple, or a picture of the First Vision (there’s one at the beginning of this outline). Then your children could choose an item and share why it is marvelous to them.

A song about the Restoration of the gospel could go well with Isaiah 29, such as “On a Golden Springtime” (Children’s Songbook, 88). And perhaps a personal experience could help the children understand what restoration means. For example, you and your children could talk about something that you lost and how you found it. Help your children compare this to the Restoration of the gospel. According to Isaiah 29:13–15, why do we need the Restoration? What marvelous works is the Lord doing to restore His gospel? (see this week’s activity page).
