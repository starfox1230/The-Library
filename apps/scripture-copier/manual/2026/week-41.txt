October 5–11. “He Hath Borne Our Griefs, and Carried Our Sorrows”: Isaiah 50–57








Jesus wearing a crown of thorns
The Mocking of Christ, by Carl Heinrich Bloch

October 5–11: “He Hath Borne Our Griefs, and Carried Our Sorrows”

Isaiah 50–57
Throughout his ministry, Isaiah spoke of a mighty deliverer. These prophecies would have been especially precious to the Israelites centuries later when they were in captivity in Babylon. Someone who could tear down the walls of Babylon would be a mighty conqueror indeed. But that isn’t the kind of Messiah that Isaiah described in chapters 52–53: “He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him. … We did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted” (Isaiah 53:3–4).

By sending such an unexpected deliverer, God taught us about true deliverance. To save us from oppression and affliction, God sent One who Himself “was oppressed, and … afflicted.” Where some expected a lion, He sent a lamb (see Isaiah 53:7). Surely, God’s ways are not our ways (see Isaiah 55:8–9). Jesus Christ frees us not by just opening the prison but by taking our place there. He relieves us from our chains of grief and sorrow by bearing them Himself (see Isaiah 53:4–5, 12). He does not save us from a distance. He suffers with us, in acts of “everlasting kindness” that “shall not depart from thee” (Isaiah 54:8, 10).

Ideas for Learning at Home and at Church
Isaiah 50–52

The future is bright for the Lord’s people.
Even though the Israelites spent many years in captivity—and even though that captivity was a result of their own poor choices—the Lord wanted them to look to the future with hope. What do you find in Isaiah’s message that gives you hope? A chart like this one might help you study:

What I learn about God (see, for example, Isaiah 50:2, 5–9; 51:3–8, 15–16; 52:3, 9–10)

Messages of hope (see, for example, Isaiah 50:9; 51:3–5, 11–12, 22–23; 52:9–10)

What I can do to make hope a reality (see, for example, Isaiah 50:10; 51:1–2, 6–9; 52:1–3, 9–11)

Jesus carrying a cross
Because of Love, by Angela Johnson

Help learners come unto Jesus Christ. “Nothing you do as a teacher will bless learners more than helping them know Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and feel Their love” (Teaching in the Savior’s Way, 8). As you prepare to teach Isaiah 50–57 to others, consider how you can help them see connections between Israel’s challenges, Isaiah’s prophecies of Christ, and receiving divine help with their own struggles.

Isaiah 53

seminary iconJesus Christ took upon Himself my sins and sorrows.
Few chapters in scripture describe Jesus Christ’s redemptive mission more beautifully than Isaiah 53. Consider activities like these to better understand and apply these powerful teachings:

Ponder or discuss how stories and movies often depict heroes who rescue people. Contrast those depictions with the descriptions of the Savior in Isaiah 53.

After reading each verse, pause to contemplate what the Savior suffered—the “griefs,” “sorrows,” and “transgressions” He bore—for all people and specifically for you. You might replace words like “we” and “our” with “I” and “my” as you read. What feelings or thoughts do these verses inspire in you?

Consider watching the video “My Kingdom Is Not of This World” (Gospel Library), and ponder how the prophecies in Isaiah 53 were fulfilled. What are some of the griefs and sorrows the Savior carries for you?



5:25
My Kingdom Is Not of This World

Find pictures of the events surrounding the Atonement of Jesus Christ (see Gospel Art Book, nos. 56–60). You could then find phrases in Isaiah 53 that describe the events in the pictures. What do these teachings inspire you to do?

See also “Behold the Great Redeemer Die,” Hymns, no. 191.

Isaiah 54; 57:15–19

Jesus Christ wants me to return to Him.
We all have times when we feel distant from the Lord because of our sins or weaknesses. Some have even given up hope that He will ever forgive them. Isaiah 54 and 57 are great chapters to read for reassurance and encouragement during such times. Particularly in Isaiah 54:4–10; 57:15–19, what words teach you how the Savior feels about you? What difference does it make in your life to know these things about Him?

President Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught:

“It matters not how completely ruined our lives may seem. It matters not how scarlet our sins, how deep our bitterness, how lonely, abandoned, or broken our hearts may be. Even those who are without hope, who live in despair, who have betrayed trust, surrendered their integrity, or turned away from God can be rebuilt. …

“The joyous news of the gospel is this: because of the eternal plan of happiness provided by our loving Heavenly Father and through the infinite sacrifice of Jesus the Christ, we can not only be redeemed from our fallen state and restored to purity, but we can also transcend mortal imagination and become heirs of eternal life and partakers of God’s indescribable glory” (“He Will Place You on His Shoulders and Carry You Home,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2016, 102).

See also Patrick Kearon, “God’s Intent Is to Bring You Home,” Liahona, May 2024, 87–89.

Isaiah 55–56

The Lord invites all to “take hold of my covenant.”
For generations, Israel had been identified as God’s covenant people. However, God’s plan has always included more than just one nation, for “every one that thirsteth” is invited to “come … to the waters” (Isaiah 55:1). Keep this in mind as you read Isaiah 55 and 56, and ponder what it means to be God’s people. What is God’s message to those who feel “utterly separated” from Him? (Isaiah 56:3). Consider marking verses that describe attitudes and actions of those who “take hold of my covenant” (see Isaiah 56:4–7).

Ideas for Teaching Children
Isaiah 51–52

The Lord invites me to “put on [my] strength.”
It might be fun for your children to discover phrases like “awake,” “stand up,” and “put on thy strength” in Isaiah 51:9, 17; 52:1–2, 9 and then act out those phrases. After doing so, you could talk about what it means to awake, stand up, and put on strength spiritually. What is the Lord asking us to do in these verses?

Your children could also read Isaiah 51:1, 4, 7 and identify who the Lord is speaking to and what He wants them to do. What does it mean to “hearken unto” the Lord? How can we show the Lord that we “hearken unto” Him?

Isaiah 53:3–9

Jesus Christ took upon Himself my sins and sorrows.
You and your children could look at several pictures showing the suffering and death of Jesus Christ (see, for example, Gospel Art Book, nos. 56, 57, 58). Then you could read together Isaiah 53:3–6, 9 and look for words that describe what is happening in the pictures. Help your children understand that Isaiah shared these truths hundreds of years before they happened. Why would it be important for people to know these things so many years in advance? (see Alma 39:15–19).

After reading from Isaiah 53:4, “He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows,” your children could try to lift a heavy object (or pretend to lift one). Talk about how “grief” and “sorrow” or sadness can feel heavy and hard to carry. Why did Jesus carry our “griefs,” “sorrows,” and “iniquities” or sins? (see also Alma 7:11–12).

Jesus Christ with children
Isaiah 55:6

I can seek the Lord and call upon Him.
To teach your children about Isaiah 55:6, you could hide a picture of Jesus somewhere in the room. You could invite your children to find the picture and name one way they can “seek … the Lord while he may be found.” A song like “Seek the Lord Early” (Children’s Songbook, 108) could give them ideas. Then you could let one of the children hide the picture and repeat the activity.

Isaiah 55:8–9

The Lord’s ways are higher than mine.
After reading Isaiah 55:9, it might be fun for your children to stand on a stool and talk about how things look different when you are “higher.” Or they could draw a picture of what Isaiah 55:9 means to them. You could then discuss some of the Lord’s ways that are higher than our ways. For example, what is His way of treating sinners? (see Mark 2:15–17). What is His way of leading others? (see Matthew 20:25–28). Share with your children how you have learned to trust the Lord’s higher ways and thoughts.
