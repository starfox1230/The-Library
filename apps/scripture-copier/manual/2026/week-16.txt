April 13–19. “Stand Still, and See the Salvation of the Lord”: Exodus 14–18








Red Sea
April 13–19: “Stand Still, and See the Salvation of the Lord”

Exodus 14–18
The Israelites were trapped. The Red Sea was on one side, and the army of Pharaoh was advancing on the other. Their escape from Egypt, it seemed, would be short lived. But God had a message for the Israelites that He wanted them to remember for generations: “Fear ye not. … The Lord shall fight for you” (Exodus 14:13–14).

Since that time, when God’s people have needed faith and courage, they have told this story. When Nephi wanted to inspire his brothers, he said, “Let us be strong like unto Moses; for he truly spake unto the waters of the Red Sea and they divided hither and thither, and our fathers came through, out of captivity, on dry ground” (1 Nephi 4:2). When King Limhi wanted his captive people to “lift up [their] heads, and rejoice,” he reminded them of this same story (Mosiah 7:19). So did Alma, when he wanted to testify to his son of God’s power (see Alma 36:28). And when we feel trapped—when we need a little more faith to “see the salvation of the Lord”—we can remember how “the Lord saved Israel that day” (Exodus 14:13, 30).

Exodus 14; Exodus 15:1–21

The Lord can do a “great work” in my life.
As you read Exodus 14:1–10, imagine how the Israelites might have felt as they saw Pharaoh’s army closing in. Perhaps you feel that you need a miracle to survive a difficult challenge you are facing. What do you find in Exodus 14:13–31 that inspires you to seek God’s power in your life? Ponder how you have seen His power in the past. What have you learned about Him from these experiences?

Exodus 15:1–19 is a song of praise that the Israelites sang after the Lord parted the Red Sea. Which phrases in this song do you find especially meaningful? Maybe there’s a hymn that you feel like singing when the Lord has done something amazing for you, such as “Redeemer of Israel” (Hymns, no. 6). Consider singing or listening to it as part of your worship today.

See also Doctrine and Covenants 8:2–3.

Exodus 15:22–27; 16:1–15; 17:1–7

The Lord can make bitter things sweet.
Reading about Israel’s journey might lead you to think about things in your life that have seemed “bitter” like the waters of Marah (see Exodus 15:23–27). How has the Lord made bitter things in your life sweet? What value have these experiences had in your life?

You’ll notice more examples of bitter experiences for the Israelites in Exodus 16 and 17. It’s tempting to be critical of their murmuring or complaining, but as you read, consider whether you have ever done the same thing. What do you learn from the Israelites’ experiences that can help you murmur less and trust God more? What do these verses teach you about God?

Exodus 16

seminary iconThe Lord offers me daily spiritual nourishment.
Since we all need to eat, the Lord often compares spiritual things to food. Look for His spiritual lessons in the Israelites’ experiences with manna in Exodus 16. For example, what do you find in the Lord’s instructions in Exodus 16:16, 19, 22–26 that applies to your spiritual nourishment?

To discover other lessons the Lord may want you to learn from this miracle, ponder questions like these:

What does the Lord give me that is like the daily manna that He gave the Israelites?

What can I do that is like gathering manna?

Think of other things, besides eating, that you do every day. Why do certain things have to be done daily to be effective? What do you feel inspired to do to seek daily spiritual experiences?

Exodus 17:1–7

Jesus Christ is my spiritual rock and living water.
Think about the Savior as you read Exodus 17:1–7. How is Jesus Christ like a rock to you? (see Psalm 62:6–7; Helaman 5:12). How is He like water? (see John 4:10–14; 1 Corinthians 10:1–4; 1 Nephi 11:25).

Look for physical objects that testify of Christ. Whenever the scriptures describe things that could be symbols of Jesus Christ, like Exodus 17:1–7 does, it might be an opportunity for an object lesson. Looking at or touching a rock or water can make it easier to understand how these objects are like Jesus Christ. If you can involve multiple senses in learning, it will be more memorable and impactful.

Exodus 17:8–16; 18:13–26

Disciples help each other “bear the burden” of doing the Lord’s work.
There may be times in your life when you can relate to Moses—when others are depending on you, but your “hands [feel] heavy” (Exodus 17:12). Other times, you might be more like Aaron, Hur, and Jethro, who supported Moses. Put yourself in the position of each of these people as you read Exodus 17:8–16; 18:13–26, and see what the Lord teaches you about His work.

Ideas for Teaching Children
Exodus 14:5–22

The Lord can do a “great work” in my life.
When the Lord parted the Red Sea, Moses and the Israelites saw how powerful He is. Let your children help you think of a fun way to reenact the story from Exodus 14:5–22 (see also “The Passover” in Old Testament Stories, 70–74). Maybe you could set up chairs or blankets and “divide” them like the Red Sea. Then you could share with each other how you have seen God’s power in your lives.



2:54
The Passover

What does Doctrine and Covenants 8:2–3 add to our understanding of the story in Exodus 14? Consider telling your children about an experience when the Holy Ghost told you something in your mind or heart, and invite them to talk about their experiences. You could also sing a song about the Holy Ghost, such as “Let the Holy Spirit Guide” (Hymns, no. 143).

Exodus 15:22–25

The Lord can make bitter things sweet.
Maybe you and your children could drink something sweet and something bitter while studying Exodus 15:22–25 together. How has the Savior made “bitter” experiences in our lives “sweet”?

Exodus 15:23–25; 16:14–15; 17:1–6

Jesus is my Living Water, my Bread of Life, and my Rock.
As you and your children read Exodus 15:23–25; 16:14–15; 17:1–6, let them help you find objects to help tell each story—like a branch (to heal the water at Marah), a jar or pot (to fill with manna), and a rock (for the water at Horeb). What do these stories remind us about what Jesus Christ does for us? As part of your discussion, you might read Matthew 7:24–27; John 4:10–14; 6:29–35, 48–51; Helaman 5:12; Doctrine and Covenants 20:77, 79.

Exodus 17:8–16; 18:13–26

I can help “bear the burden” of doing the Lord’s work.
As you read Exodus 17:8–16, you could invite a child to hold their hands high in the air. When the child gets tired, other children could help, the way Aaron and Hur helped Moses. What does this story teach about how we can help God’s kingdom be successful? You could also read Exodus 18:13–26 and talk about the heavy responsibilities of people who serve in your ward. What can we do today to help our Church leaders, just as Aaron and Hur helped the prophet Moses?
