December 21–27: “We Have Waited for Him, and He Will Save Us”

Christmas
The Old Testament carries a spirit of eager anticipation. In that way, it’s a little bit like the Christmas season. Beginning with Adam and Eve, Old Testament patriarchs, prophets, poets, and people looked forward to better days, filled with hope for the Messiah’s renewal and deliverance. And the Israelites were frequently in need of that hope—whether they were in captivity in Egypt or Babylon or held captive by their own sin or rebellion. Through it all, prophets reminded them that a Messiah, a Deliverer, would come “to proclaim liberty to the captives” (Isaiah 61:1).

That hope began to be realized when Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem. The mighty Deliverer of Israel was born in a stable and laid in a manger (see Luke 2:7). But He wasn’t just the Deliverer of the ancient Israelites. He came to deliver you—to bear your grief, to carry your sorrows, to be bruised for your iniquities, so that with His stripes you can be healed (see Isaiah 53:4–5). This is why Christmas is so full of joyful anticipation even today. The Messiah came over 2,000 years ago, and He continues to come into our lives whenever we seek Him.

Christmas is known as a joyful season because of the joy that Jesus Christ brings to the world. Centuries before the Savior was born, Old Testament prophets also felt joy as they spoke of the coming Messiah. Read some of the following passages, and think about why they would have been precious to people who looked forward to the Savior’s mission: Psalm 35:9; Isaiah 25:8–9; 44:21–24; 51:11; Zephaniah 3:14–20; Moses 5:5–11. Why are these passages precious to you? What reasons do these scripture passages give to be joyful?

Symbols can help me remember Jesus Christ.
Many of the traditions associated with Christmas can have symbolic meanings that point us to Christ. As you studied the Old Testament this year, you may have noticed many symbols of the Savior. A few are listed below. Consider studying these and recording what they teach you about Him.

Star (Numbers 24:17; Matthew 2:2; Revelation 22:16).

Shepherd (Psalm 23; Luke 15:4–7; John 10:11)

Lamb (Genesis 22:8; Exodus 12:5; 1 Peter 1:18–20).

Water (Exodus 17:1–6; Jeremiah 2:13; Ezekiel 47:1–12; John 4:7–14).

Rock (1 Samuel 2:2; 2 Samuel 22:2–3; Psalm 118:22–23; Isaiah 28:16; Ephesians 2:20).

Branch (Isaiah 11:1–2; Jeremiah 23:5; 33:15).

Light (Psalm 27:1; Isaiah 9:2; 60:19; Micah 7:8; John 8:12).

What other symbols, passages, and accounts have you found in the scriptures that testify of Jesus Christ?

See also 2 Nephi 11:4; Mosiah 3:14–15; Moses 6:63; “Types or Symbols of Christ” and “Jesus Christ,” both in Guide to the Scriptures (Gospel Library).

“His name shall be called Wonderful.”
Jesus Christ is referred to by many different names and titles. Look for titles in the following verses: Psalms 23:1; 83:18; Isaiah 7:14; 9:6; 12:2; 63:16; Amos 4:13; Zechariah 14:16; Moses 7:53. What other titles can you think of? You might even enjoy listing titles of Jesus Christ that you find in Christmas hymns. How does each title influence the way you think about Him?

Consider choosing a title or role of the Savior that will help you remember Him throughout the coming year.

Ideas for Teaching Children
The Old Testament teaches me about Jesus.
You and your children might have some Christmas decorations you can use to start a conversation about Jesus Christ. Maybe you could talk about how a Christmas star, lights, or a gift reminds us of the Savior. Then you could look in one or more of the following scriptures for something that could symbolize Jesus Christ: Genesis 22:8; Numbers 24:17; Psalms 23:1; 27:1. Maybe your children could hold up a picture or decoration that goes with each verse as they read it. How is Jesus like a lamb, star, shepherd, or light? Consider singing a Christmas song together, like “Stars Were Gleaming” (Children’s Songbook, 37).

Your children could also look at the picture at the end of this outline as you read Isaiah 9:6 to them. Ask your children to point to the baby Jesus when they hear the phrase “a child is born.” Share your testimony that prophets in the Old Testament knew that Jesus would be born.

As you prepare to study the life of Jesus Christ in the New Testament next year, consider reviewing with your children what they have learned about Him this year in the Old Testament. You might review the outlines in this resource and any personal study notes to help you remember what you’ve learned. Younger children might benefit from looking through Old Testament Stories or the pictures in Come, Follow Me. What prophecies or stories stood out? What have we learned about the Savior?

Christmas traditions can point to Jesus Christ.
Israelite families had traditions, such as the Passover and other feasts, that were meant to point their hearts and minds to the Lord (see Exodus 12). What traditions do you and your children have at Christmastime that help you focus on Jesus Christ? What traditions do you know about from your family history? You might consider discussing with your children some traditions you want to start. Some ideas might include serving someone in need, choosing something you will offer as a “gift” to the Savior, inviting a friend to watch the First Presidency’s Christmas devotional with you (broadcasts.ChurchofJesusChrist.org), writing your own Christmas song, or finding a creative way to share the message of Christ’s birth.

In the home, learning and living are inseparable. “The gospel takes on immediate relevance in the home. There the people with whom you are learning the gospel are the people with whom you will live it—every day. In fact, much of the time, living the gospel is how we learn the gospel. So as you learn and teach the gospel at home, look for ways to connect what you are learning with what you are doing. In your home, let the gospel be something you strive to live by, not just something you talk about” (Teaching in the Savior’s Way, 31).

Heavenly Father gave me the gift of His Son to be my Savior.
How can you help your children feel the reverence and joy of Christ’s birth? You might watch the video “The Christ Child” (Gospel Library) or read together Matthew 1:18–25; 2:1–12; Luke 1:26–38; 2:1–20. Each child could choose a person from the video or scripture account and share how that person felt about the Savior. Then you could share with each other your own feelings about Him.



17:57
The Christ Child

Perhaps you and your children could talk about gifts you’ve given or received over the years that have brought joy. Then you could read Isaiah 25:9 together and talk about why you rejoice that Heavenly Father sent us a Savior. To help your children better understand Jesus Christ’s role as our Savior, invite them to read Isaiah 25:8–9; 53:3–5; and Hosea 13:14. What do these scriptures teach us about how the Lord saves us?

You could also sing a Christmas song together, such as “Away in a Manger” (Children’s Songbook, 42–43) or “O Little Town of Bethlehem” (Hymns, no. 208). Help your children find phrases in the song that help them know that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ love them.
