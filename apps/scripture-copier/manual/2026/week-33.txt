Job surrounded by other people
The Judgments of Job, by Joseph Brickey

August 10–16: “Yet Will I Trust in Him”

Job 1–3; 12–14; 19; 21–24; 38–40; 42
It’s natural to wonder why bad things happen to good people—or, for that matter, why good things happen to bad people. Why would God, who is just, allow that? The book of Job explores questions like these. Job was one of those good people to whom a lot of bad things happened. Because of Job’s trials, his friends wondered if he really was good after all. Job asserted his own righteousness and wondered if God really is just after all. But despite his suffering and wondering, Job maintained his integrity and faith in Jesus Christ. In the book of Job, faith is questioned and tested but never completely abandoned. That doesn’t mean all the questions are answered. But the book of Job teaches that until they are answered, questions can coexist with faith. And regardless of what happens in the meantime, we can say of our Lord, “Yet will I trust in him” (Job 13:15).

For an overview of the book of Job, see “Job” in the Guide to the Scriptures (Gospel Library).

Ideas for Learning at Home and at Church
Job 1–3; 12–13

I can trust God in all circumstances.
The opening chapters of Job emphasize, in a poetic way, Satan’s role as our adversary or accuser; they don’t describe an actual interaction between God and Satan. As you read what Satan said about Job (see Job 1:9–11; 2:4–5), you might ask yourself, “Why do I remain faithful to God?” Why would it be dangerous to obey the Lord solely for the reason Satan suggested?

What impresses you about Job’s responses to his trials? (see Job 1:20–22; 2:9–10).

Job’s friends suggested that God was punishing him (see Job 4–5; 8; 11). What problems do you see with this idea? Read Job’s response in chapters 12–13. What did Job know about God that enabled him to keep trusting? What do you know about God that helps you face challenges?

Job 19

Jesus Christ is my Redeemer.
Sometimes we learn the most important truths during our most difficult times. Ponder the trials Job described in Job 19:1–22 and the truths he proclaimed in verses 23–27. How do you know that your Redeemer lives? What difference does this knowledge make in your life?

Consider singing or listening to a hymn about Jesus Christ, such as “I Know That My Redeemer Lives” (Hymns, no. 136). What words from this hymn express your feelings about Him?

See also Doctrine and Covenants 121:1–12; 122.

Job 21–24

seminary icon“When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.”
In Job 21–24, you’ll read a debate between Job and his friends. At the heart of this debate was a question many people have asked: Why do righteous people sometimes suffer?

Although we don’t have all the answers, in the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, we have some truths that can help us make sense of adversity and suffering. Below are latter-day scriptures that contain some of these truths. What do these scriptures teach you about Heavenly Father and His plan?

2 Nephi 2:11–13

Mosiah 23:21–23; 24:10–16

Ether 12:27

Doctrine and Covenants 58:3–5

Abraham 3:22–26

You could also read President Spencer W. Kimball’s teachings about adversity in “Tragedy or Destiny?” (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer W. Kimball [2011]), 11–21).

Based on what you have studied, how might you answer a question like “Why does God allow righteous people to suffer?”

Job 38–40; 42

God’s perspective is greater than mine.
Frustrated with his friends’ accusations (see Job 16:1–5; 19:1–3), Job repeatedly asked God why he had to suffer so much (see Job 19:6–7; 23:1–9; 31). The Lord did not give a clear reason in the book of Job. But He did teach an important message in chapters 38–40. How would you summarize that message? For example, what do you learn from the Lord’s questions in Job 38:1–7, 18–24?

You’ll notice that the Lord spoke to Job about some of His creations and other mighty works (see Job 38–39). You might look at some of those creations (or pictures of them). How do these things help you think differently about God? about your trials? How did they change Job’s perspective? (see Job 42:1–6; see also Moses 1:8–10).

Here are two general conference messages that can help change our perspective: Tamara W. Runia, “Seeing God’s Family through the Overview Lens” (Liahona, Nov. 2023, 62–69); Russell M. Nelson, “Think Celestial!” (Liahona, Nov. 2023, 117–20). In either message, look for something that you’ll want to remember the next time your trials seem overwhelming. How will you remind yourself of what you learned?

Be creative. Learning doesn’t have to consist only of reading, thinking, and talking. Sometimes the most memorable learning comes in physically active ways. For example, when you read about how the Lord changed Job’s perspective in Job 38–40, you might take a walk and look at some of the Lord’s creations, large and small. Or you might look at an object from different perspectives—from above, below, up close, far away, and so on.

Ideas for Teaching Children
Job 1–2; 12; 19

Faith in Jesus Christ will help me during hard times.
Encourage your children to tell you what they know about Job. If they need help, you could point them to Job 1:1, 13–22; 2:7–10 or to “Job” (in Old Testament Stories, 145–47). How did Job respond to challenges? (see Job 1:21; 2:10).



1:55
Job

Job was faithful in his challenges because of what he knew about the Lord. Maybe you and your children could look at pictures of Jesus Christ interacting with others (such as the one below or pictures in the Gospel Art Book). Talk about what you know about Him and what He is like. Here are some verses that show what Job knew about the Lord: Job 12:10, 13, 16; 19:25–27. Why is it valuable to know these things about Him?

He Healed Them All, by Michael Malm

Job 14:14

Because of Jesus Christ, I will live again after I die.
Job asked an important question in Job 14:14. Maybe you and your children could take turns sharing how you would answer Job. You could look for ideas in Alma 11:42–44, in the video “In a Coming Day” (Gospel Library), or in a song about the Resurrection, such as “Did Jesus Really Live Again?” (Children’s Songbook, 64).

#BECAUSEofHIM: An Easter Message of Hope and Triumph

Job 16:1–5; 22:5

Good friends uplift and encourage each other.
When Job was sad, his friends said that God was punishing him because he had sinned (see Job 22:5). If we were Job’s friends, how would we try to help him? How can our words help others when they are sad? (see Job 16:5). Consider showing one or more of the pictures in this outline as you discuss these questions.

Consider asking your children to list some qualities of a good friend and to name a friend who has these qualities. Then you could look at a picture of Jesus Christ. In what ways is Jesus a good friend to each of us? You might think of someone who’s going through a hard time. Plan how you will be a Christlike friend to them.

Job 19:23–27

Jesus Christ is my Redeemer.
After reading Job 19:23–27, you and your children could talk about how you know that our Redeemer lives. You might work together to put your testimony (or drawings of the Savior) in a book (see verse 23).

You could also sing a song that testifies of the Savior, such as “I Know That My Redeemer Lives” (Hymns, no. 136). Share phrases from the hymn that strengthen your faith in Him. Why is it important to know that Jesus Christ lives?
