December 7–13: “Holiness unto the Lord”

Haggai 1–2; Zechariah 1–4; 7–14
After decades of captivity, a group of Israelites, probably including the prophets Haggai and Zechariah, were allowed to return to Jerusalem. Some in this group remembered what the temple looked like before it was destroyed. To those who wondered whether it would ever again resemble the Lord’s “house in her first glory” (Haggai 2:3), Haggai spoke the Lord’s words of encouragement: “Be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the Lord, and work: for I am with you, … fear ye not.” “I will fill this house with glory, … and in this place will I give peace” (Haggai 2:4–5, 7, 9).

But it wasn’t just the holy temple that needed rebuilding. In many ways, God’s people were spiritually in ruins. And rebuilding a holy people takes more than cutting stones and positioning them to build a holy house. It means the inscription “Holiness unto the Lord” must be engraved not just on a temple wall, or even on “the bells of the horses” and “every pot in Jerusalem” (Zechariah 14:20–21). They must also be engraved on every heart.

For an overview of the books of Haggai and Zechariah, see “Haggai” and “Zechariah” in the Bible Dictionary.

Haggai 1; 2:1–9

seminary icon“Consider your ways.”
There were many important things to do to rebuild Jerusalem. But after roughly 15 years had passed since the Israelites’ return, the Lord was displeased that the rebuilding of the temple had not been given higher priority (see Haggai 1:2–5; see also Ezra 4:24). As you read Haggai 1; 2:1–9, consider questions like these:

What consequences did the Israelites face because they had not finished the temple?

What blessings did the Lord promise them if they finished building His house?

What is the Lord’s message to you in Haggai 1:5–7? How could you align your priorities with the Lord’s? When have you been blessed for putting God first in your life?

The early Latter-day Saints faced a similar situation to the Israelites in Haggai’s day (see Doctrine and Covenants 95). What do you learn from these two examples about the Lord’s feelings about temples?

The Lord can make me holy.
In your opinion, what’s the value of having “holiness unto the Lord” engraved on everyday objects like those mentioned in Zechariah 14:20? (see also Exodus 28:36–38). What’s the value of having it engraved on temples today? What does this phrase mean to you? How can you make holiness part of your daily life? Ponder these questions as you read the Lord’s invitations to His people to become more holy in Zechariah 1:1–6; 3:1–7; 7:8–10; 8:16–17.

You could also read Zechariah 2:10–11; 8:1–8; 14:9–11, 20–21 to learn what life will be like in a future day when we all dwell with the Lord in a state of holiness. What impresses you about Zechariah’s vision of the future of Jerusalem? What do you find here that you would like to see in your community? How can you prepare to live in the conditions Zechariah described?

Jesus Christ is the promised Messiah.
Several of Zechariah’s writings point both to the earthly ministry of Jesus Christ and to His eventual Second Coming. Below are some of Zechariah’s prophecies, along with scriptures about their fulfillment. As you study these passages, ask yourself: What does this teach me about the Savior?

Zechariah 9:9–11 (see Matthew 21:1–11; 1 Peter 3:18–19)

Zechariah 11:12–13 (see Matthew 26:14–16; 27:1–7)

Zechariah 12:10 (see John 19:37; Revelation 1:7)

Zechariah 13:6–7; 14:1–9 (see Matthew 26:31; Doctrine and Covenants 45:47–53)

What do you think it would have been like to be among the people welcoming Jesus into Jerusalem as described in Zechariah 9:9–11? How can you welcome Him into your life, your homes, and your community?

Ideas for Teaching Children
Haggai 1:2–8

“Consider your ways.”
As you read parts of Haggai 1:2–5 with your children, help them find out why the Lord was not pleased with the people. Perhaps your children could pick a phrase from verse 6 and draw a picture of it. They could show it to each other and guess what phrase each drawing represents. When we spend time on things other than what the Lord wants, how is that like eating but not being filled? You might talk with each other about how you can make time for the things that are important to the Lord.

You could also read verse 8 to your children and invite them to pretend to “go up to the mountain,” “bring wood,” and “build the house [of the Lord].” Your children could make a list of things they do in a typical day, including things the Lord has asked them to do. Ask your children to “consider [their] ways” by circling what the Lord might say are the most important things on their list.

Home-centered teaching. President Russell M. Nelson has taught that the home should be the “center of gospel learning” (“Becoming Exemplary Latter-day Saints,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2018, 113). As your family studies Haggai’s counsel to “consider your ways,” you could talk about how to put God first in your family life.

Zechariah 3:1–7

Making and keeping covenants can help me be more like Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.
In a vision, Zechariah saw a high priest who was “clothed with filthy garments” (Zechariah 3:3). An angel gave him clean clothing. You could help your children discover important truths by reading together Zechariah 3:1–7 and talking about what the dirty clothing and clean clothing might represent. How do we become clean from our sins, even after we are baptized? How does our baptismal covenant help us “walk in [the Lord’s] ways”?

You and your children could look at a picture of a baptism, like the one in this outline. Why do we wear white at our baptism? You could also sing a song about baptism, such as “When I Am Baptized” (Children’s Songbook, 103); what does the song teach about why the Lord wants us to be baptized?

Jesus Christ is the promised Messiah.
Your children might like to visualize the event foretold in Zechariah 9:9, when Jesus came into Jerusalem during the last week of His mortal life. To help with this, show them a picture of the event, like the one in this outline. You could also share with them “The Savior Goes to Jerusalem” (in New Testament Stories, 110–12). Your children could point to people in the pictures who are “rejoicing greatly.” Who is the King in Zechariah 9:9? Why are we thankful for Him?

Chapter 44: The Savior Goes to Jerusalem

Consider helping your children compare prophecies from Zechariah with the New Testament verses describing their fulfillment. Here are some examples: Zechariah 9:9 and Matthew 21:5–9; Zechariah 9:11 and 1 Peter 3:18–19; Zechariah 11:12 and Matthew 26:14–16; Zechariah 13:7 and Matthew 26:31. What do we learn about the Savior from these verses?
