Jesus with Children, by Dilleen Marsh

September 7–13: “He Shall Direct Thy Paths”

Proverbs 1–4; 15–16; 22; 31; Ecclesiastes 1–3; 11–12
You might think of the book of Proverbs as a collection of wise counsel from loving parents (see Proverbs 1:8). Its main message is that if you seek wisdom—especially God’s wisdom—life will go well. But Proverbs is followed by the book of Ecclesiastes, which seems to say, “It’s not that simple.” The Preacher quoted in Ecclesiastes observed that he “gave [his] heart to know wisdom” but still found “vexation of spirit” and “much grief” (Ecclesiastes 1:17–18). In various ways, the book asks, “Can there be real meaning in a world where everything seems vain, temporary, and uncertain?”

And yet, while the two books look at life from different perspectives, they teach similar truths. Ecclesiastes declares: “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man” (Ecclesiastes 12:13). This is the same principle found throughout Proverbs: “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart” (Proverbs 3:5; see also verse 7). Life is always better—if not always perfect—when we trust and follow the Lord Jesus Christ.

For an overview of these books, see “Proverbs, book of” and “Ecclesiastes” in the Bible Dictionary.

Ideas for Learning at Home and at Church
Proverbs 1–4; 15–16; Ecclesiastes 1–3; 11–12

“Incline thine ear unto wisdom.”
The books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes are filled with insights about wisdom. Consider marking the word “wisdom” and related words, like “knowledge” and “understanding,” as you find them in Proverbs 1–4; 15–16; Ecclesiastes 1–3; 11–12. How do these chapters affect the way you think about wisdom? Based on what you find, how would you describe the wisdom that “the Lord giveth”? (Proverbs 2:6). What blessings come from God’s wisdom?

See also Matthew 7:24–27; 25:1–13.

Help learners share what they’re learning. “Give learners opportunities to share with each other what they are learning about the Savior and His gospel. Doing this will help them internalize the truths they are taught and express them. It will also help them gain confidence in their ability to share truths in other settings” (Teaching in the Savior’s Way, 26). For example, you could invite learners to write down some references from Proverbs or Ecclesiastes where they found insights about God’s wisdom. Then invite learners to talk about what they learned.

Proverbs 1:7; 2:5; 3:7; 15:33; 16:6; 31:30; Ecclesiastes 12:13

“Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord.”
Another theme found throughout Proverbs and Ecclesiastes is “the fear of the Lord.” Watch for this phrase as you read. What do you feel it means to fear the Lord? Look for insights in Elder David A. Bednar’s message “Therefore They Hushed Their Fears” (Ensign or Liahona, May 2015, 46–49). How is fear of the Lord different from other kinds of fear?

See also Proverbs 8:13.

Proverbs 3:5–7; 4

seminary icon“Trust in the Lord with all thine heart.”
How would you try to persuade someone that it’s better to “trust in the Lord” than to “lean … unto [our] own understanding”? (Proverbs 3:5). What comparisons or object lessons would you use? As you ponder Proverbs 3:5–7, think of ways you might complete sentences like these: Trusting the Lord is like … Leaning on our own understanding is like …

Why is it unwise to lean on our own understanding? How have you discovered that the Lord is trustworthy?

Even so, we might find it difficult to trust the Lord at times. Why is that? Elder Gerrit W. Gong suggests some reasons, along with helpful counsel, in “Trust Again” (Liahona, Nov. 2021, 97–99). What stories or teachings do you find in this message that might help someone restore their trust in the Lord?

Both Proverbs 3:6 and Proverbs 4 compare life to a “path” or a “way.” What do you think it means to let the Lord “direct [your] paths”? (Proverbs 3:6). What do you find in chapter 4 that helps you “ponder the path of [your] feet”? (verse 26). For example, what do verses 11–12 and 18–19 teach about the blessings of following the right path? What do verses 26–27 mean to you?

See also 2 Nephi 31:18–21; “Lord, I Would Follow Thee,” Hymns, no. 220.

Proverbs 15; 16:24–32

“A soft answer turneth away wrath.”
Some of the ideas in Proverbs 15–16 might inspire you to improve the way you communicate with others, especially loved ones. For example, think about specific times when “a soft answer” helped to “[turn] away wrath” (Proverbs 15:1).

You might also think of times when the Savior exemplified the teachings in Proverbs 15:1–4, 18 (see Mark 12:13–17; John 8:1–11). How can you follow His example as you interact with others?

How might the counsel in Proverbs 15; 16:24–32 apply to today’s digital communication? See if you can find a verse in these chapters that you could rephrase as advice about interacting over social media or through text.

Who Can Find a Virtuous Woman? II, by Louise Parker

Proverbs 31:10–31

“A woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.”
Proverbs 31:10–31 describes “a virtuous woman,” or a woman of great spiritual strength, capability, and influence. You might try summarizing in your own words what each of these verses says about virtuous women. Which of these traits can you emulate?

Ecclesiastes 1–3; 12

Mortal life is temporary.
Why is it valuable for you to remember that much in this world, as Ecclesiastes 1–2 asserts, is “vanity” (or temporary and often unimportant)? What do you find in Ecclesiastes 12 that gives life eternal value?

Ideas for Teaching Children
Proverbs 1:7; 2:5; 15:33; 16:6; Ecclesiastes 12:13

To “fear God” means to love and obey Him.
To help your children understand passages about fearing God, you could substitute the word “fear” with words like reverence, love, or obedience (see also Hebrews 12:28). How does this affect the way we think about these verses? How do we show that we fear the Lord?

Proverbs 3:5–7

I can trust in the Lord with all my heart.
You and your children could make up actions to go with Proverbs 3:5–7, like making a heart with your hands, leaning to one side, walking in place, and pointing to your eyes. How can we show that we trust Jesus Christ with all our hearts?

To show what it means to “lean not unto thine own understanding” (Proverbs 3:5), consider inviting your children to lean against something sturdy and stable, like a wall. Then they could try leaning against something that is not sturdy, like a broom. Or they could try leaning a stick or a pencil against objects of varying sturdiness, such as a book or a piece of paper. Why is it important to “trust in the Lord” (verse 5) and not our “own understanding”?

Proverbs 15:1, 18

I can use kind words.
Perhaps you and your children can think of situations when you or they might feel angry. Read Proverbs 15:1 together, and help your children apply this verse to the situations they thought of. Maybe they could practice some “soft answers.” A song about kindness, such as “Love Is Spoken Here” (Children’s Songbook, 190–91), could reinforce this principle.

To learn what it means to be “slow to anger” (Proverbs 15:18), you and your children could share times when you (or someone you know) felt angry but chose to be kind. Help your children think of things we can be quick to if we are “slow to anger.” For example, we can be quick to think about Jesus, to ask Heavenly Father for help, to think of a Primary song, or, if possible, to walk away.
