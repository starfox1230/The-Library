October 26–November 1: “I Will Turn Their Mourning into Joy”

Jeremiah 31–33; 36–39; Lamentations 1; 3
When the Lord first called Jeremiah to be a prophet, He told him that his mission would be “to root out, and to pull down” (Jeremiah 1:10)—and in Jerusalem, there was plenty of wickedness to root out and pull down. But this was only part of Jeremiah’s mission—he was also called “to build, and to plant” (Jeremiah 1:10). What could be built or planted in the desolate ruins left by the rebellion of the covenant people? Asked another way, when sin or adversity has left our lives in ruins, how can we rebuild and plant again? The answer lies in “the Branch of righteousness” (Jeremiah 33:15), the promised Messiah. He brings “a new covenant” (Jeremiah 31:31)—one that requires more than the outward appearance of devotion. His law must be “in [our] inward parts,” written “in [our] hearts.” That’s what it means for the Lord to “be [our] God” and for us to “be [His] people” (Jeremiah 31:33). It’s a lifelong process, and we will still make mistakes and have cause to mourn from time to time. But when we do, the Lord promises, “I will turn their mourning into joy” (Jeremiah 31:13).

For an overview of Lamentations, see “Lamentations, Book of” in the Guide to the Scriptures.

Ideas for Learning at Home and at Church
Jeremiah 31; 33

The Lord will bring His covenant people out of captivity.
In Jeremiah 31; 33 the Lord acknowledged the “lamentation, and bitter weeping” (Jeremiah 31:15) the Israelites would experience in captivity. However, he also offered words of comfort and hope. Look for them as you read these chapters. What promises do you find that apply to you?

Jeremiah 31:31–34; 32:37–42

seminary icon“They shall be my people, and I will be their God.”
Although the Israelites had broken their covenants, Jeremiah prophesied that the Lord would again establish a “new” and “everlasting covenant” with them (Jeremiah 31:31; 32:40). What is that covenant? Consider looking for insights in Guide to the Scriptures, “New and Everlasting Covenant,” Gospel Library.

As you read Jeremiah 31:31–34; 32:37–42, ponder:

What it means to you to be part of God’s covenant people.

What it means to have His law written in your heart.

What the Lord promises when you make covenants with Him.

How your covenant relationship with the Lord changes you.

What promises have you made to God as you have participated in sacred ordinances? How is He fulfilling His promises to you?

Jeremiah 36

The scriptures have power to turn me away from evil.
According to Jeremiah 36:2–3, why did the Lord command Jeremiah to record his prophecies? As you read Jeremiah 36, note how the following people felt about these prophecies:

The Lord (see verses 1–3, 27–31)

Jeremiah (see verses 4–7, 32)

Baruch (see verses 4, 8–10, 14–18)

Jehudi and King Jehoiakim (see verses 20–26)

Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah (see verse 25)

Ponder how you feel about the scriptures. How have they helped you turn away from evil?

Jeremiah 37–39

Be firm in following God’s prophets.
In Jeremiah 37:1–3, 15–21; 38:1–6, 14–28, what evidence do you see that King Zedekiah believed Jeremiah was the Lord’s true prophet? What evidence do you see that Zedekiah did not believe? What do you learn from this comparison? As you read Jeremiah 39, ponder the difference it would have made if Zedekiah and his people had followed the prophet and kept the commandments of the Lord. (Compare what happened to Zedekiah with what happened to Lehi’s family in 1 Nephi 1–2.)

Jeremiah 38:6–13; 39:15–18

I can be bold in standing up for what is right.
The king’s officials felt that Jeremiah’s prophecies were making their soldiers less willing to fight, so they threw Jeremiah into a filthy dungeon (see Jeremiah 38:1–4). In Jeremiah 38:6–13, what impresses you about the response of Ebed-melech the Ethiopian? Notice also the blessing the Lord gave Ebed-melech in Jeremiah 39:15–18.

How could you follow Ebed-melech’s example?

Lamentations 1; 3

The Lord can relieve the sorrow I experience because of sin.
The book of Lamentations is a collection of poems written after the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple. Why do you think it is important they were preserved? Consider what the metaphors in Lamentations 1 and 3 help you understand about the great sorrow Israel felt. What messages of hope in Christ do you find? (see especially Lamentations 3:20–33; see also Matthew 5:4; James 4:8–10; Alma 36:17–20).

President M. Russell Ballard mentioned several situations that may cause some to lose hope, and he offered counsel about where to find hope:

“Some of us may find our lives laden with frustration, disappointment, and sorrow. Many feel helpless to deal with the chaos that seems to prevail in the world. Others anguish over family members who are being carried downstream in a swift, raging current of weakening values and declining moral standards. … Many have even resigned themselves to accept the wickedness and cruelty of the world as being irreparable. They have given up hope. …

“… Some among us may have lost all hope because of sin and transgression. A person can become so deeply immersed in the ways of the world that he sees no way out and loses all hope. My plea to all who have fallen into this trap of the adversary is to never give up! Regardless of how desperate things may seem or how desperate they may yet become, please believe me, you can always have hope. Always” (“The Joy of Hope Fulfilled,” Ensign, Nov. 1992, 31–32).

Help others take responsibility for their own learning. Sometimes it seems like the easiest way to teach is to just tell learners what we think they should know. However, the easiest way is not always the best way. Elder David A. Bednar taught: “Our intent ought not to be ‘What do I tell them?’ Instead, the questions to ask ourselves are ‘What can I invite them to do? What inspired questions can I ask that, if they are willing to respond, will begin to invite the Holy Ghost into their lives?’” (evening with a General Authority, Feb. 7, 2020, broadcasts.ChurchofJesusChrist.org; see also Teaching in the Savior’s Way, 25). There are many ways to help learners take responsibility for their learning. For example, in this outline learners are invited to search, ponder, make lists, look at pictures, participate in object lessons, draw, and share and apply what they learn.

Ideas for Teaching Children
Jeremiah 31:3

Heavenly Father and Jesus love me “with an everlasting love.”
As you read Jeremiah 31:3 with your children, they could help you find objects (or pictures of objects) that last a long time, such as a metal coin, and some that do not, such as a piece of fruit. You could talk about what “everlasting” means and share with each other how you have felt Heavenly Father’s “everlasting love.” You could also sing together a song like “God Is Watching Over All” (Children’s Songbook, 229).

Jeremiah 31:31–34; 32:38–41

God will help me keep my covenants.
Your children might enjoy drawing a heart on a piece of paper and then writing in the heart things they learn from Jeremiah 31:31–34 about making covenants with God. You may want to review the covenant they make at baptism (see Mosiah 18:10, 13) and discuss what it means to have these promises written in their hearts.

Jeremiah 36:1–4

The scriptures are the word of God.
This week’s activity page could help your children learn about Jeremiah, Baruch, and the king (see Jeremiah 36). They could also do actions that go along with the words in Jeremiah 36:4–10, such as writing in a book (see verse 4) and reading the scriptures to the people (see verses 8, 10).

You and your children could look at a children’s book and a copy of the scriptures and talk about how these books are different. What makes the scriptures special? It may be inspiring to share with each other some scripture passages that are special to you.

Jeremiah 38:6–13

I can stand up for what is right.
You could use the picture at the end of the outline to help your children visualize the story of Ebed-melech in Jeremiah 38:6–13. Maybe you could help them find a verse where Ebed-melech did something brave to help the Lord’s prophet. What can we do to show that we know our prophet today is called of God?

Lamentations 1:1–2, 16; 3:22–26

The Savior made it possible for me to be forgiven of my sins.
To introduce Lamentations, you may want to explain to your children that because the Israelites had not repented, Jerusalem and the temple were destroyed. You could share with each other how you might have felt if you were living there at that time (see Lamentations 1:1–2, 16). How might the message in Lamentations 3:22–26 have given you hope?

You could also tell each other about times you felt sad about a bad choice you made. What do we find in Lamentations 3:22–26 that helps us understand the forgiveness Jesus Christ offers?
