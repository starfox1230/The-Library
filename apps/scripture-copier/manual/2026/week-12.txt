March 16–22. “God Meant It unto Good”: Genesis 42–50








Joseph forgiving his brothers
Forgiveness, by Megan Rieker

March 16–22: “God Meant It unto Good”

Genesis 42–50
It had been about 22 years since Joseph’s brothers sold him into slavery. Joseph had suffered many trials, including false accusations and imprisonment. When he finally saw his brothers again, Joseph was the governor of all Egypt, second only to the pharaoh. He could easily have taken revenge on his brothers, and considering what they had done to Joseph, that might seem understandable. And yet Joseph forgave them. Not only that, but he helped them see divine purpose in his suffering. “God meant it unto good” (Genesis 50:20), he told them, because it put him in a position to save “all his father’s household” (Genesis 47:12) from famine.

In many ways, Joseph was like Jesus Christ. Even though our sins caused Jesus great suffering, He offers forgiveness, delivering all of us from a fate far worse than famine. Whether we need to receive forgiveness or extend it—at some point we all need to do both—Joseph’s example points us to the Savior, the true source of healing and reconciliation.

Genesis 45:5–7; 47:12

“God sent me before you to preserve you.”
Have you noticed any similarities between Joseph’s life and the atoning mission of Jesus Christ? To see some examples of these similarities, try comparing:

Genesis 37:3 with Matthew 3:17.

Genesis 37:26–28 with Matthew 26:14–16.

Genesis 45:5–7 with Luke 4:18.

Genesis 47:12 with John 6:35.

What impressions do you have about the Savior and His mission as you read these passages?

Genesis 45; 50:15–21

seminary iconForgiveness brings healing.
Reading about Joseph forgiving his brothers of the terrible things they had done may prompt you to think about someone you are currently struggling to forgive. The following questions may help as you strive to apply this principle:

Why might it have been hard for Joseph to forgive his brothers? (to review what they did to him, see Genesis 37). What experiences or attitudes might have given Joseph the strength to forgive? (see, for example, Genesis 45:1–15 or 50:15–21).

What blessings came from Joseph’s forgiveness of his brothers? For example, compare the relationships in Jacob’s family at the beginning of the story (see, for example, Genesis 37:3–11) with the relationships at the end (see Genesis 45:9–15; 50:15–21). How might things have turned out differently if Joseph had not been willing to forgive?

Consider writing down the name of someone who may need your forgiveness—whether or not they have asked for forgiveness. What can you do to invite the Savior’s healing power into that situation? If forgiving seems too difficult, consider reviewing the counsel of Elder Gerrit W. Gong in the last six paragraphs of his message “Happy and Forever” (Liahona, Nov. 2022, 85). What do you find that gives you hope that you can forgive?

Genesis 49

Jacob gave his family prophetic blessings.
Jacob’s blessings to his posterity contain vivid imagery, but they aren’t easy to understand. Thankfully, the restored gospel gives us some help. When you read the blessing to Joseph in Genesis 49:22–26, read the following verses too, and see what insights they provide: 1 Nephi 15:12; 2 Nephi 3:4–5; Jacob 2:25; Doctrine and Covenants 50:44.

As you read about Judah’s blessing in Genesis 49:8–12, remember that Jesus Christ was a descendant of Judah. What do you find in these verses that reminds you of the Savior? (see also Revelation 5:5–6, 9; 1 Nephi 15:14–15; Doctrine and Covenants 45:59; 133:46–50).

Reading these blessings might inspire you to review your patriarchal blessing—or, if you don’t have one, to receive one. What words and phrases in your blessing turn your thoughts to Jesus Christ?

See also Randall K. Bennett, “Your Patriarchal Blessing—Inspired Direction from Heavenly Father,” Liahona, May 2023, 42–44.

Genesis 50:19–21

God can help me find meaning in my trials.
Though it may not have been clear while he was going through it, Joseph was eventually able to look back on his adversity in Egypt and see that “God meant it unto good” (Genesis 50:20). If you could have visited Joseph while he was in the pit or in prison, how would you have comforted him? How can Genesis 50:19–21 help you in your times of trial?

Joseph Smith among the Prophets, by Paul Mann (detail)

Genesis 50:24–25

“A seer shall the Lord my God raise up.”
As you read Genesis 50:24–25 and Joseph Smith Translation, Genesis 50:24–38 (in the Bible appendix), ponder why it would have been important for Joseph to know about Moses and Joseph Smith so many centuries in advance. How did Joseph Smith fulfill Joseph’s prophecies about him? (see Doctrine and Covenants 1:17–23; 20:7–12; 39:11; 135:3).

Ideas for Teaching Children
Genesis 42–44; 45:4–15

I can show love and forgiveness to my family.
It might be fun for your children to reenact the story of Joseph reuniting his family (see Genesis 42–44). Or they could use “Joseph and the Famine” (in Old Testament Stories, 57–60) or pictures in this outline to teach the story to each other. Here are some questions that could help your children learn from the story:

What did Joseph do to show love for his family? (see Genesis 45:4–15).

Why do you feel Joseph forgave his brothers?

How do you think Joseph’s brothers felt when they found out Joseph had forgiven them? Who in your life needs to be forgiven? How can you show love and forgiveness?



2:26
Joseph and the Famine

As you prepare to teach, ask, “What will my children do to learn?” For example, in this activity your children are acting out or retelling a story. Doing this will help them remember both what happened and the gospel principles contained in the story.

You or your children may want to share an experience when they forgave someone or when someone forgave them. You could then sing a song such as “Love One Another” (Children’s Songbook, 136) or “Help Me, Dear Father” (Children’s Songbook, 99).

Genesis 48:8–9

The Lord helps me through priesthood blessings.
You and your children could look at the picture of Jacob blessing his sons at the end of this outline and discuss what is happening (see Genesis 48:8–9). If needed, explain that Jacob, Joseph’s father, wanted to give priesthood blessings to his family. Perhaps you could share with each other any experiences you’ve had receiving help from God through a priesthood blessing. What are some reasons we might ask for a priesthood blessing?

Genesis 45:5–11

Heavenly Father sent Jesus Christ to save me.
How can you help your children see the Savior in the story of Joseph saving his family from famine? Consider making a chart with two columns labeled Joseph and Jesus Christ. Help your children search the following pairs of scriptures and fill in the chart with things that Joseph and Jesus have in common: Genesis 37:3 and Matthew 3:17; Genesis 37:26–28 and Matthew 26:14–16; Genesis 45:5–7 and Luke 4:18; and Genesis 47:12 and John 6:35.

Ask your children what it means to save or rescue someone. If any of them have had an experience being saved or rescued from danger, invite them to share. How did Joseph save his brothers? (see Genesis 42:1–3; 45:5–7). Then you could look at a picture of the Savior together and ask your children to talk about how Jesus saves us.
