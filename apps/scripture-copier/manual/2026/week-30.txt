July 20–26. “Our Eyes Are upon Thee”: 2 Chronicles 14–20; 26; 30








King Jehoshaphat praying
King Jehoshaphat’s Prayer, by Keeley Rae

July 20–26: “Our Eyes Are upon Thee”

2 Chronicles 14–20; 26; 30
The Kingdom of Judah was surrounded. Armies from three powerful enemy nations were all advancing at once, prepared for battle. In this desperate moment of need, Jehoshaphat, King of Judah, turned to the King of heaven and earth. Jehoshaphat gathered his people at the temple and prayed. He acknowledged their human weakness and pleaded for deliverance. In response, the Lord promised His protection: “Fear not, nor be dismayed” (2 Chronicles 20:17).

We might not have an invading army at our doorstep threatening to destroy us, but sometimes we do feel surrounded by adversity and evil. Our path to deliverance is the same one Jehoshaphat sought, and our prayer can be like his too: “O our God, … we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee” (2 Chronicles 20:12).

In 2 Chronicles 14–30, you will read about Jehoshaphat and other kings in Judah. Consider how their faith-driven reforms, victories, and challenges can apply to your own life.

For an overview of the book of 2 Chronicles, see “Chronicles” in the Bible Dictionary.

Ideas for Learning at Home and at Church
2 Chronicles 14–16

Trusting in God will bring me peace.
When Asa was the king of Judah, he faced many challenges—just like we all do today. As you read about the trials he faced, notice where he put his trust and how that changed over time.

Challenges Asa faced

Where Asa put his trust

2 Chronicles 14:9–12

2 Chronicles 15:1–8

2 Chronicles 16:1–10

Why do we sometimes stop trusting the Lord? What else do you learn from Asa’s life?

2 Chronicles 18

I can defend the truth, even when it’s unpopular.
The prophet Micaiah must have felt a lot of pressure to predict success for the kings Jehoshaphat and Ahab in their war against Syria. Look for evidence of that pressure in 2 Chronicles 18:1–12. What evidence do you find of Micaiah’s courage and integrity in verses 13–27? (Note that in verse 14, Micaiah gives a sarcastic response; his real answer is in verse 16.) How are Micaiah’s words fulfilled in verses 28–34?

What are some situations in which you might face pressure like Micaiah faced? What gives you courage to stand up for the Lord and His teachings?

In the days of King Jehoshaphat, three nations attacked Jerusalem.

2 Chronicles 20:1–25

seminary iconIn difficult times, I can turn to God and His prophets.
As you read 2 Chronicles 20:1–12, look for what King Jehoshaphat did when multiple nations came to attack Judah. How could you apply his actions in the challenging circumstances you face?

The Lord’s response to Jehoshaphat’s prayer is found in verses 14–17. What phrases do you find there that could comfort you or someone you know during difficult times?

The following day, the people of Jerusalem went out to meet the opposing army. As you read 2 Chronicles 20:20, look for the message Jehoshaphat gave to the people of Jerusalem. How were his words fulfilled? (see verses 22–23). How has God blessed you for believing in Him and following His prophets?

President Russell M. Nelson said: “My experience is that once you stop putting question marks behind the prophet’s statements and put exclamation points instead, and do it, the blessings just pour. I never ask myself, ‘When does the prophet speak as a prophet and when does he not?’ My interest has been, ‘How can I be more like him?’” (in Lane Johnson, “Russell M. Nelson: A Study in Obedience,” Ensign, Aug. 1982, 24).

A Secure Anchor

Identify simple statements of truth. Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught: “The scriptures offer us so many doctrinal diamonds. And when the light of the Spirit plays upon their several facets, they sparkle with celestial sense and illuminate the path we are to follow” (“According to the Desire of [Our] Hearts,” Ensign, Nov. 1996, 21). As you study the scriptures, consider taking time to identify, mark, and ponder short yet powerful messages. Some examples can be found in 2 Chronicles 14:11; 15:7; 18:13; 20:15; 26:5. What other “doctrinal diamonds” can you find?

2 Chronicles 26:3–21

Pride leads to destruction.
As with many other kings of Judah, Uzziah’s reign began with great accomplishments but ended with tragedy. Look for this pattern in 2 Chronicles 26. What would you say was the turning point in Uzziah’s life?

As you read verses 16–23, keep in mind that at this time, only priests were allowed to burn incense in the temple. Why do you think King Uzziah disobeyed God? What do you learn from this tragic experience?

2 Chronicles 30

I can be a peacemaker.
In 2 Chronicles 30, Hezekiah was the king of Judah. He invited the rival Kingdom of Israel to gather in Jerusalem to celebrate Passover—something the Israelites hadn’t been able to do for many years (see verses 1–12). What impresses you about the invitation and how it was received—both by the Israelite guests and by their hosts in Judah?

Because it had been so long, some visitors to Jerusalem were not familiar with the details of how to participate in Passover. As you read 2 Chronicles 30:18–27, what do you learn from Hezekiah’s response and the results of his response?

Ideas for Teaching Children
2 Chronicles 14–16; 20

I can trust God.
To introduce the idea of trusting the Lord, you might show your children something you trust to keep you dry when it rains, like an umbrella or jacket. Let them talk about why we can trust these things. Then help them compare that to our trust in the Lord. Why do we trust Him to keep us safe spiritually?

You could help your children discover how King Asa and King Jehoshaphat responded to challenges by trusting in the Lord (see 2 Chronicles 14:11; 20:3–5, 12). Share with each other ways you can show the Lord that you trust Him.

2 Chronicles 20:1–29

God will hear and answer my prayers.
This week’s activity page can help your children understand the story of Jehoshaphat’s prayer and the Lord’s answer. You and your children could share times when God heard and answered your prayers. Consider including times when the answers came in ways or at times that you didn’t expect. A song about prayer, such as “I Pray in Faith” (Children’s Songbook, 14), could help build your children’s faith.

2 Chronicles 26:3–23

I can be humble.
To learn about the dangers of pride, your children could build a tower with blocks or small cups. As they place each block or cup on the tower, help them identify one of Uzziah’s accomplishments from 2 Chronicles 26:3–15. After they finish the tower, discuss with your children how Uzziah could keep it tall and strong. What could make it fall? Then, as you read verse 16, you could talk about what it means to have our hearts “lifted up to [our] destruction.” Share with your children what happened to Uzziah in verses 16–23. Let them knock down their tower. Talk about what we can do to stay humble.

2 Chronicles 30

I can be a peacemaker.
The picture above shows when Hezekiah invited Judah’s neighbors from the Kingdom of Israel to celebrate Passover with them. You could look at this image with your children and read 2 Chronicles 30:18–19, which explains that some of the guests had not washed themselves according to the law of Moses. What did Hezekiah do? How would this have made the guests feel? Help your children think of how they can be like Hezekiah in the way they treat others.
