August 31–September 6: “Let Every Thing That Hath Breath Praise the Lord”

Psalms 102–103; 110; 116–119; 127–128; 135–139; 146–150
The traditional Jewish name for the book of Psalms is Tehillim, a Hebrew word that means “praises.” It’s related to the exclamation hallelujah (meaning “praise Jehovah” or “praise the Lord”). If you had to choose one word to sum up the main message of the Psalms, praise would be a good choice. Some psalms contain the direct invitation to “praise ye the Lord” (see especially Psalms 146–50), and all of them can inspire worship and praise. The Psalms invite us to acknowledge the Lord’s power, His mercy, and the great things He has done. We can never repay Him for any of this, but we can praise Him. That praise might take different forms for different people—it might involve singing, praying, or bearing testimony. It often leads to a deeper commitment to the Lord and to following His teachings. Whatever “praise ye the Lord” means in your life, you can find inspiration to do it as you read and ponder the Psalms.

Psalms 102–3; 116

The Lord can comfort me in my suffering.
Note how Psalm 102:1–11 describes feelings of anxiety and isolation that often come during challenges. Maybe you or others you know have experienced such feelings. As you read Psalms 102:12–28; 103; 116, look for phrases that give you confidence to “call upon the name of the Lord” in your trials (Psalm 116:13). You might want to mark, memorize, or share with others phrases that give you hope in Him.

Psalms 110; 118

Jesus Christ fulfilled prophecies from the Psalms.
The Psalms contain passages that point toward the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. Here are a few examples:

Psalm 110:1–4 (see Matthew 22:41–45; Hebrews 5:4–10; 6:20)

Psalm 118:22 (see Matthew 21:42; Acts 4:10–11; 1 Peter 2:7)

Psalm 118:25–26 (see Matthew 21:9)

What do these verses teach you about Jesus Christ? Why is it important to know this about Him?

Psalm 119

seminary iconGod’s word will keep me on His path.
Psalm 119 contains many phrases that compare our lives to a journey back to Heavenly Father. As you read, look for words like “walk,” “path,” “way,” “feet,” and “wander.” Ponder your own life’s journey—where you have been, where you are now, and where you are heading. What do you learn from this psalm about your journey back home? What have you learned by watching the paths of others? According to this psalm, what has God provided to help you stay on His path?

Think about a time when following a path or a map helped you travel somewhere successfully. What does that experience teach you about following God’s path?

In many other scriptures, the Lord and His prophets speak of a path. Below are some examples. Consider searching these verses and writing down or sharing with others what you learn.

Scripture

What I learn about the path to God

Proverbs 4:11–19

Matthew 7:13–14

1 Nephi 8:20–28

2 Nephi 31:17–21

Alma 7:9, 19–20

Doctrine and Covenants 25:2

How can these truths help you stay on God’s path?

What additional insights can you learn from the following counsel from President Russell M. Nelson?

“If our journey through life is to be successful, we need to follow divine direction. The Lord said, ‘Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not’ [Doctrine and Covenants 6:36]. And the Psalmist wrote, ‘Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path’ [Psalm 119:105]. …

“In your journey through life, you meet many obstacles and make some mistakes. Scriptural guidance helps you to recognize error and make the necessary correction. You stop going in the wrong direction. You carefully study the scriptural road map. Then you proceed with repentance and restitution required to get on the ‘strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life’ [2 Nephi 31:18]” (“Living by Scriptural Guidance,” Ensign, Nov. 2000, 17).

See also Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “The Prodigal and the Road That Leads Home,” Liahona, Nov. 2023, 86–88.

Psalms 134–36

The Lord is more powerful than any idol.
Notice why, according to Psalm 135:15–18, it is foolish to trust in false gods. What might you be tempted to trust in that is similar to an idol? You might make a list of the things the Lord can do, as the psalmists did in Psalms 134–36. What powerful things has He done for you?

Psalm 139

The Lord knows my heart.
What do you find in Psalm 139 that helps you understand that the Lord is aware of you—your thoughts and actions, strengths and weaknesses? How does this truth influence your life and your choices?

Psalms 146–50

“Praise ye the Lord.”
As you read these final psalms of praise, think about reasons you have to praise the Lord. Why is it important to praise Him? What are some ways you can praise Him?

Ideas for Teaching Children
Psalm 102:1–2

The Lord comforts me and gives me hope.
You or one of your children could read Psalm 102:1–2, looking for how the Lord helps us during our difficulties. How can we find His help? You could also share with each other times when you needed help and felt that God heard your prayers.

Psalm 119:105

God’s word is like a light.
Your children might have fun talking about what it feels like to be in the dark. Or they could discuss things that are hard to do in the dark. You might invite them to do something with their eyes closed, such as draw a picture. What do we learn from Psalm 119:105 about light and the word of God?

Look for something Heavenly Father has given us to help us stay on His path in the following verses: Psalms 119:47–48; 119:105; 1 Nephi 11:25; 2 Nephi 31:20. What can we do to stay on God’s path?

Your children might enjoy looking at pictures of the things mentioned in Psalm 119:105. They could place the pictures in order as they read the verse. You could also sing a related song together, such as “Teach Me to Walk in the Light” (Children’s Songbook, 177) or “I Will Walk with Jesus” (Gospel Library).

Psalm 139:1–3, 23–24

Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ know me and love me.
Consider making short lists of things you know about each of your children. As you read the lists one at a time, ask the children to guess who you are describing. Then, after reading Psalm 139:1–3 together, you could list things that Heavenly Father and Jesus know about us.

Write the words of Psalm 139:23–24 on a piece of paper or a board. Invite your children to underline words that describe things God can do for us. Why would we want God to do these things?

Psalm 146:1, 5–9

I can praise the Lord.
Maybe your children could share experiences when someone praised them or told them they did a good job. Share some of the good things from Psalm 146:6–9 that the Lord has done (help your children understand unfamiliar words). Invite your children to talk about other things He does for us. How can we praise Him for those things?

Learn at home; share with others. President Russell M. Nelson has taught that the home should be the “center of gospel learning” (“Becoming Exemplary Latter-day Saints,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2018, 13). What can you do this week to deepen your personal or family study of Psalms? After your study, consider sharing with others what you learned and felt. You could do this in conversation, through text or social media, or at church.
