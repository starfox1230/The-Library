June 15–21: “The Battle Is the Lord’s”

1 Samuel 17–18; 24–26; 2 Samuel 5–7
Ever since the tribes of Israel had settled in the promised land, the Philistines had been an ongoing threat to their safety. The Lord had delivered them many times in the past, but now the elders of Israel demanded, “We will have a king … [to] go out before us, and fight our battles” (1 Samuel 8:19–20). So Saul was anointed king. And yet when the menacing giant Goliath hurled his challenge to the armies of Israel, Saul—like the rest of his army—was “greatly afraid” (1 Samuel 17:11). On that day, it wasn’t King Saul who saved Israel but a humble shepherd boy named David, who was wearing no armor but was clothed with impenetrable faith in the Lord. This battle proved to Israel, and to anyone who has spiritual battles to fight, that “the Lord saveth not with sword and spear” and that “the battle is the Lord’s” (1 Samuel 17:47).

1 Samuel 17

The story of David and Goliath is one of the best-known stories in the scriptures. Of course, we usually focus on David. But this time, as you study 1 Samuel 17, ponder also the words of other people in this chapter (see the list below). What do you learn about them and their motives? What do you learn about David? How is he different?

Goliath: verses 8–10, 43–44

Eliab: verse 28

Saul: verse 33

David: verses 26, 32, 34–37, 39, 45–47

Your story, though not as well-known as David’s, is sure to include Goliath-size challenges to overcome and opportunities to exercise faith in the Lord. What does David’s example teach you about facing the adversity in your story? You might also read President Camille N. Johnson’s message “Invite Christ to Author Your Story” (Liahona, Nov. 2021, 80–82) with one of your challenges in mind. Look for answers to questions like these: How does the Lord want me to view my challenges? How has He helped me in the past? How can I show that I trust Him to write my story?

You may already know that there are some tragic chapters later in David’s story (see, for example, 2 Samuel 11). If you had the opportunity to give David some advice after his battle with Goliath, what would you say? How might this advice apply to your life?

1 Samuel 17:26–50

One person with faith in Christ can make a difference.
In addition to personal challenges, we also face large, complex problems that affect the whole world. When forces of evil are “gathered together … to battle” against the forces of good (1 Samuel 17:1), we might wonder how our individual efforts could possibly make a difference. What do you find in David’s story that gives you hope?

Jonathan and David
True Friendship and Self-Respect, by Wilson Ong (detail)

1 Samuel 18

“Jonathan loved [David] as his own soul.”
As you read 1 Samuel 18, consider contrasting Saul and his son Jonathan (who, if not for David, could have assumed he would be the next king). How did Saul and Jonathan react to David’s success? What can you learn from this experience?

What do you find in Jonathan’s attitudes and actions that reminds you of Jesus Christ?

“Liken the scriptures” (1 Nephi 19:23). The scriptures provide great opportunities to learn from the motivations and actions of people like David, Jonathan, and Saul. You’ll find that no one in the scriptures is flawless. So as you read, for example, about David’s faithful choices, be open to learning also from his mistakes. Doing so can help us identify potential weaknesses in ourselves and “learn to be more wise than [others] have been” (Mormon 9:31).

1 Samuel 24–26

Forgiveness is the sure path to peace and healing.
In 1 Samuel 24–26, look for lessons about pride, forgiveness, and self-control. You might also consider reading Elder Mark A. Bragg’s message “Christlike Poise” as part of your study (Liahona, May 2023, 60–63). How did David, Abigail, and others demonstrate—or fail to demonstrate—Christlike poise in these chapters? What opportunities do you have to show Christlike poise?

Sister Kristen Yee’s message “Beauty for Ashes: The Healing Path of Forgiveness” (Liahona, Nov. 2022, 36–39) can help you study 1 Samuel 25. How is Abigail like Jesus Christ?

2 Samuel 5:17–25

The Lord can give me direction.
Even after David defeated Goliath, his problems with the Philistines were not over. As you read 2 Samuel 5:17–25, consider how David’s example can help you in the challenges you face (see also 1 Samuel 23:2, 10–11; 30:8; 2 Samuel 2:1). How are you being blessed by acting on the revelation you receive?

2 Samuel 7

What is the “house” the Lord promised to David?
When David offered to build a house, meaning a temple, for the Lord (see 2 Samuel 7:1–3), the Lord responded that David’s son would build it (see verses 12–15; see also 1 Chronicles 17:1–15). The Lord also said that He in turn would build David a “house,” meaning a posterity, and that his throne would last forever (see 2 Samuel 7:11, 16, 25–29; Psalm 89:3–4, 35–37). This promise was fulfilled in Jesus Christ, our Eternal King, who was a descendant of David (see Matthew 1:1; Luke 1:32–33; John 18:33–37).

Ideas for Teaching Children
1 Samuel 17:20–54

Faith in Jesus Christ can help me have courage.
You may want to use “David and Goliath” in Old Testament Stories, 112–16, to help your children become familiar with what happened in 1 Samuel 17:20–54. Then you could let them retell the story using the pictures or line drawings in this outline. Ask them what they think the Lord wants them to learn from this story.



2:36
David and Goliath

You and your children could also make a list of some difficult challenges they might face during their life. Then help them find things David said that can help with these challenges (see 1 Samuel 17:26, 32, 34–37, 45–47). Share how Jesus Christ has helped you during challenges.

Your children could march like they are David going to fight Goliath while singing a song about being courageous, such as “I Will Be Valiant” (Children’s Songbook, 162).

1 Samuel 18:1–4

Good friends can be a blessing from God.
How can you help your children learn from Jonathan and David’s friendship? One way would be to give each child two paper hearts, one to represent David and the other to represent Jonathan. Then read together a few phrases from 1 Samuel 18:1–4 that emphasize the love these two friends felt for each other. Your children could then write or draw on their paper hearts how they can show love to a friend.

2 Samuel 5:19, 23

If I need guidance, I can ask Heavenly Father.
In these chapters, David became the king of Israel. It might be fun for your children to pretend to be a king or queen. What laws would they make? Where would they go for help? Help your children discover that when David needed help, he “inquired,” or prayed, for answers. For example, as you read 2 Samuel 5:19, 23, invite the children to listen for the word “inquired” and to fold their arms when they hear it. Why would David need the Lord’s help in his new role?

Tell each other about times when you prayed for Heavenly Father’s help. What difference did it make to have Him help you?

2 Samuel 7:16–17

Jesus Christ is my Eternal King.
The kings we read about in the Old Testament all had flaws, and their kingdoms all ended. But Jesus Christ is a perfect King and will reign forever. You can help your children discover this by reading together what the prophet Nathan told King David in 2 Samuel 7:16–17. How could David’s kingdom have no end? Help your children find and read scripture passages that teach that Jesus Christ, a descendant of David, is our King, such as Luke 1:32–33; John 18:33–37; and Revelation 19:16. How is Jesus different from earthly kings? How do we honor Jesus Christ as our Eternal King?
