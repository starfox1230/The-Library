March 9–15. “The Lord Was with Joseph”: Genesis 37–41

March 9–15: “The Lord Was with Joseph”

Genesis 37–41
We know that God blesses people who trust Him and keep His commandments. But sometimes it doesn’t seem that way. Sometimes the person who trusts God is abused and abandoned by family members. Sometimes the person who bravely refuses to violate the law of chastity gets falsely accused anyway. When things like that happen to us, we might be tempted to become angry with God. We might wonder, “What’s the point of trying to do the right thing if it only seems to make life harder?”

Joseph, the son of Jacob, could have wondered that. At times, this faithful man prospered; at other times, it seemed that the more faithful he was, the more hardship he faced. But Joseph never left the Lord, and the Lord never left Joseph. That doesn’t mean the Lord prevented bad things from happening to Joseph, but through it all, “the Lord was with him” (Genesis 39:3).

Ideas for Learning at Home and at Church
Genesis 37:1–28; 39; 41:9–45

The Lord will be with me in my adversity.
Time and again, good fortune seemed to abandon Joseph, but the Lord never did. As you read Joseph’s story, ponder questions such as these: What did Joseph do to stay close to the Lord? How was the Lord “with him”? (see Genesis 39; 40:1–19; 41:9–45). What do you learn from Joseph’s story that could help you recognize the Lord’s presence in your life?

You might also ask similar questions about your life. What evidence have you seen that the Lord has not forsaken you in times of trial? Consider how you can share your experiences with family members and future generations (see 1 Nephi 5:14).

Of course, you will have other trials in the future. What can you do now to help ensure that these trials don’t pull you away from the Lord? Consider writing a letter to encourage your future self to stay close to Him no matter what. You might include insights from Joseph’s life or from Elder D. Todd Christofferson’s message “Our Relationship with God” (Liahona, May 2022, 78–81).

See also John 14:18; Romans 8:28; Alma 36:3; Doctrine and Covenants 121:7–8; “Abide with Me!,” Hymns, no. 166.

Genesis 37:5–11; 40; 41:1–38

If I am faithful, the Lord will guide and inspire me.
Joseph had a gift for discerning messages from the Lord through dreams. What can you learn from Genesis 37:5–11; 40:5–8; 41:14–25, 37–38 about receiving and understanding revelation from the Lord? For instance, what can you learn from Joseph’s example when revelation seems difficult to understand? (see Genesis 40:8; 41:16).

Ponder how the Lord is revealing His will to you. What are you doing to act on revelation He has given you? How are you seeking additional guidance from Him?’

Genesis 39:1–20

seminary iconWith the Lord’s help, I can flee temptation.
If Joseph were to give counsel on how to resist temptation to commit sexual sin, what do you think he would say? Think about this as you read about his experience in Genesis 39. For example, consider how Joseph might respond to concerns like these:

If no one else knows what I’m doing, what’s the big deal? (see verses 8–9).

I try to resist, but the temptation just doesn’t seem to stop (see verse 10).

What should I do when I’m in a situation where temptation is strong? (see verse 12).

How would you explain why obeying the law of chastity is important? (see For the Strength of Youth: A Guide for Making Choices, 23–28).

Joseph’s example, of course, can apply to other kinds of temptation. With Joseph’s experience in mind, consider making a plan for avoiding and resisting temptation. For example, you could think of a temptation and write down situations to avoid and how you will “flee” when the temptation arises.

Temptation

Situations to avoid

Plan to respond

Here are some other scriptures that could inform your plan. What do you learn from each about how the Savior can help you resist temptation? Matthew 4:1–11; 1 Corinthians 10:13; 1 Nephi 15:23–24; 3 Nephi 18:17–18.

As you make your plan, it might also help to think about times in the past when you successfully avoided or resisted temptation. How did the Savior help you? (see 2 Nephi 4:18–33).

Genesis 41:15–57

The Lord will help me prepare for possible hardships.
Joseph’s interpretation of Pharaoh’s dream led to some very wise and practical counsel for surviving a famine (see Genesis 41:15–57). Consider what spiritual messages the Lord might have for you in this account. How do you feel He wants you to prepare for hardships in your future?

Ideas for Teaching Children
Genesis 37

I can be kind to my family.
Reading about the hard feelings in Joseph’s family could prompt a discussion about how we should treat family members. To tell the story of Joseph and his brothers from Genesis 37, you could use the pictures in this outline or in “Joseph’s Inspired Dreams” (in Old Testament Stories, 47–51). Let your children share details they know about the story. You might ask your children to imagine they were in Joseph’s family. What would they have said or done to be a peacemaker in the family? For example, what does it mean to “speak peaceably” in our family? (verse 4). How is Jesus Christ a peacemaker in God’s family?

Joseph’s Inspired Dreams

Genesis 37:18–28; 39:20–23; 41:38

God can help me when bad things happen.
When your children face hard times, they need to know that the Lord will be with them, as He was with Joseph. Perhaps you could help your children make a list of hard things that happened to Joseph (see Genesis 37:23–28; 39:20; or “Joseph’s Inspired Dreams” and “Joseph in Egypt,” in Old Testament Stories, 47–51, 52–56). After each hardship they find, invite your children to repeat, “The Lord was with Joseph” (Genesis 39:2).

Joseph in Egypt

Perhaps your children could search Genesis 39:1–3, 20–23 for every instance of the phrase “The Lord was with Joseph” and similar phrases. Let them share what they think this phrase means. How do we know that the Lord is with us? Tell each other about how you felt God was with you during a challenging time.

Genesis 39:7–12

With the Lord’s help, I can flee temptation.
Here’s an object lesson that can help your children follow Joseph’s example of fleeing from Potiphar’s wife: Use two magnets to represent Jesus Christ and Satan. Use a small metal object, like a paper clip, to represent us. Then let your children see how the influence of a magnet on the metal object is stronger when they move the object closer to it. How does Joseph’s experience in Genesis 39:7–12 illustrate this truth? What can we do to move away from sin and closer to Jesus? The video “Temptation Fades as We Seek Christ in Every Thought” (Gospel Library) and a song like “I Need Thee Every Hour” (Hymns, no. 98) can help with this discussion.



2:58
Temptation Fades as We Seek Christ in Every Thought

Use music. “Hymns and other sacred songs can help children feel God’s love, feel the Spirit, and learn gospel truths. The melodies, rhythms, and simple rhymes can help children remember gospel truths for years to come. As you sing with children, help them discover and understand the principles taught in the songs” (Teaching in the Savior’s Way, 32).

Help your children think of temptations they might face. Let them role-play how they could “flee” from these temptations.
