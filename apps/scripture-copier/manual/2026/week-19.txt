May 4–10: “Rebel Not Ye against the Lord, Neither Fear”

Numbers 11–14; 20–24; 27
Even on foot, it wouldn’t take 40 years to travel from the wilderness of Sinai to the promised land in Canaan. But that’s how long the children of Israel needed—not to cover the geographical distance but to cover the spiritual distance: the distance between who they were and who they could become as God’s covenant people.

The book of Numbers describes some of what happened during those 40 years, including lessons the children of Israel needed to learn before entering the promised land. They learned about being faithful to the Lord’s servants (see Numbers 12). They learned about trusting the Lord’s power, even when the future seems hopeless (see Numbers 13–14). And they learned that being faithless brings spiritual harm, but they could repent and look to the Savior for healing (see Numbers 21:4–9).

We’re all like the Israelites in some ways. We know what it’s like to be in a spiritual wilderness, and the lessons they learned can help us prepare to enter our promised land: eternal life with our Heavenly Father.

Ideas for Learning at Home and at Church
Numbers 11:11–17, 24–29; 12

Revelation is available to everyone, but God guides His Church through His prophet.
In Numbers 11:11–17, 24–29, notice the problem Moses faced and the solution God proposed. What do you think Moses meant when he said he wished “that all the Lord’s people were prophets”? (verse 29). As you ponder this question, look for possible answers in President Russell M. Nelson’s message “Revelation for the Church, Revelation for Our Lives” (Ensign or Liahona, May 2018, 93–96).

Saying we can all receive revelation, however, doesn’t mean we all can lead God’s people the way Moses did. The event in Numbers 12 makes this clear. What cautions do you find in this chapter? What do you feel the Lord wants you to understand about personal revelation and following His prophet?

See also 1 Nephi 10:17; Doctrine and Covenants 28:1–7; Dallin H. Oaks, “Two Lines of Communication,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2010, 83–86.

Focus on what’s most important. Some people get overwhelmed with the weekly reading suggestions in Come, Follow Me. As you review the outlines, follow the Spirit. Consider your own needs and the needs of the people you may be teaching. Understanding and fully applying one principle in a week could be more helpful than reading several chapters only superficially.

Numbers 12:3

“Moses was very meek.”
Some people are surprised to learn that Moses, the mighty leader who stood before Pharaoh and performed stunning miracles with the Lord’s power, was also “very meek” (Numbers 12:3). What does it mean to be meek? Consider studying Elder David A. Bednar’s explanation in “Meek and Lowly of Heart” (Ensign or Liahona, May 2018, 30–33) or “Meek, Meekness” in Guide to the Scriptures (Gospel Library).

What do you learn from Moses’s examples of meekness in Exodus 18:13–25; Numbers 11:26–29; Numbers 12; Hebrews 11:24–27; and Moses 1:10–11? You might also ponder how the Savior showed meekness (see Matthew 11:29; 27:11–14; Luke 22:41–42; John 13:4–5). What do these examples teach you?

Numbers 13–14

With faith in the Lord, I can have hope for the future.
As you read Numbers 13–14, try to put yourself in the place of the Israelites. Why do you think they wanted to “return into Egypt”? (Numbers 14:3). How would you describe the other “spirit” Caleb had? (Numbers 14:24). What impresses you about the faith of Caleb and Joshua, and how might you apply their examples to situations you face?

Numbers 21:4–9

seminary iconIf I look to Jesus Christ in faith, He can heal me spiritually.
Book of Mormon prophets knew the story found in Numbers 21:4–9 and understood its spiritual significance. Read their teachings about this story in 1 Nephi 17:40–41; Alma 33:18–22; and Helaman 8:13–15. Here are some questions to ponder as you do:

What could the brass serpent represent?

What might the snakebites represent?

The Israelites had to “[behold] the serpent of brass” (Numbers 21:9) to be healed. Why do you think some people refused to look? Does something similar ever happen to you?

What do you feel inspired to do to more fully “look upon the Son of God with faith” and be healed? (Helaman 8:15).

Reading these passages might remind you of other times in the scriptures when people needed to keep their focus on Christ. For example, compare the message of Numbers 21:4–9 with Matthew 14:25–31 and 1 Nephi 8:24–28 (see also the pictures at the end of this week’s outline). What tends to draw us away from Christ? How does He bless people who stay focused on Him?

See also “Jesus, the Very Thought of Thee” (Hymns, no. 141).

Numbers 22–24

I can follow God’s will, even if others try to persuade me not to.
When Balak, the king of Moab, learned that the Israelites were approaching, he called for Balaam, a man known for pronouncing blessings and curses. Balak wanted him to curse the Israelites. Notice how Balak tried to persuade Balaam (see Numbers 22:5–7, 15–17), and think about temptations you might face to go against God’s will. What impresses you about Balaam’s responses in Numbers 22:18, 38; 23:8, 12, 26; 24:13? Sadly, Balaam eventually gave in to pressure and betrayed Israel (see Numbers 31:16; Jude 1:11). Ponder how you can remain faithful to the Lord despite pressure from others.

Ideas for Teaching Children
Numbers 11:4–10

I can be thankful for what God has given me.
Ask your children if they remember some of the miracles the Lord performed to help the Israelites (see “The Plagues of Egypt” and “The Passover” in Old Testament Stories, 67–74). Then you could summarize for them Numbers 11:4–10, emphasizing that the Israelites had forgotten their blessings and were complaining. What blessings do we sometimes forget?

As you sing or listen to a song about gratitude, such as “Count Your Blessings” (Hymns, no. 241), your children could draw pictures of blessings the Lord has given them.

Numbers 12

The Lord wants me to follow His prophet.
To introduce Numbers 12, you could tell your children that the Lord was unhappy with Aaron and Miriam, Moses’s brother and sister. Invite them to read Numbers 12:1–8 to find out why. Consider using the Gospel Art Book to help your children find examples of people in the scriptures who respected the Lord’s prophet and were blessed. How are we blessed when we follow the Lord’s prophet?

Numbers 21:6–9

I can look to Jesus Christ.
You could use “Moses and the Brass Serpent” in Old Testament Stories, 83–84, to help your children learn what happened in Numbers 21:6–9. How is the brass serpent like Jesus Christ? (see John 3:14–15). Your children might enjoy making a serpent out of paper and writing on it some simple things they can do to “look upon the Son of God with faith” (Helaman 8:15).



1:2
Moses and the Brass Serpent

Older children could choose one of the following scriptures and share what it adds to their understanding of the story: 1 Nephi 17:41; Alma 33:18–20; Helaman 8:13–15; Doctrine and Covenants 6:36.

Numbers 22–24

I can follow God’s will, even if others try to persuade me not to.
Summarize Numbers 22:1–18 for your children, emphasizing how Balaam refused to curse God’s people, even though Balak, the king of Moab, offered him honor and riches. Then you could help your children search the following verses for phrases that they feel show that Balaam wanted to follow God: Numbers 22:18; 23:26; 24:13. Perhaps your children could pick one phrase they like and write it on a card to help them remember to obey the Lord.
