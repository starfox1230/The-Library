April 27–May 3: “Holiness to the Lord”

Exodus 35–40; Leviticus 1; 4; 16; 19
Leaving Egypt—as important as that was—didn’t fully accomplish God’s purposes for the children of Israel. Even a comfortable life in the promised land wasn’t God’s ultimate goal for them. These were only steps toward what God really wanted for His people: “Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God am holy” (Leviticus 19:2). How did God plan to make His people holy after they had lived in captivity for generations? He commanded them to create a place of holiness in the wilderness—a tabernacle. He gave them covenants and laws to guide their actions and change their hearts. And He commanded them to make animal sacrifices to teach them about atonement for their sins. All of this was meant to point their minds, hearts, and lives toward the Savior. He is the true path to holiness, for the Israelites and for us. We have all spent some time in the captivity of sin, and we are all invited to leave sin behind and follow Jesus Christ, who has promised, “I am able to make you holy” (Doctrine and Covenants 60:7).

For an overview of the book of Leviticus, see “Leviticus” in the Bible Dictionary.

Exodus 35–40; Leviticus 19

seminary iconThe Lord wants me to become holy.
Exodus 35–40 describes the Israelites’ efforts to build a tabernacle, where sacred ordinances would help them become a holy people. As you read these chapters, look for the things the Lord asked His people to place in the tabernacle. What might these items represent? What do they suggest to you about increasing in holiness? Especially consider how these items turn your thoughts toward the Savior. A table like this might help you:

What object did you find?

What can this represent?

Ark of the covenant (Exodus 37:1–9; 40:20–21)

 (See Exodus 25:20–22; Guide to the Scriptures, “Ark of the Covenant”)

Altar of incense (Exodus 40:26–27; see also Exodus 30:1, 6–8)

 (See Revelation 8:3–4)

Candlestick or lampstand (Exodus 37:17–24)

 (See Matthew 5:14–16; John 8:12)

Altar of sacrifice (Exodus 38:1–7; see also Exodus 27:1; 29:10–14)

 (See Guide to the Scriptures, “Sacrifice”)

Laver (basin) of water (Exodus 30:17–21)

 (See 2 Chronicles 4:6; Isaiah 1:16; Jeremiah 33:8)

Of course, simply being in holy places doesn’t make us holy. Leviticus 19 describes laws and commandments the Lord gave to help the Israelites increase in holiness. What do you find in these commandments that could help you seek holiness from the Lord? What do you feel impressed to do to more fully live these principles?

7:19
The Tabernacle

Use sacred music. Music has great power to invite the influence of the Spirit and build faith in Jesus Christ. The messages in hymns often reinforce the doctrine in the scriptures. For instance, singing a hymn like “More Holiness Give Me” (Hymns, no. 131) can reinforce some of the messages taught in Leviticus 19. It can also help you think about what it means to become more holy like the Savior and ponder how He is helping you increase in holiness.

Exodus 35:4–35; 36:1–7

The Lord asks me to make my offerings with a willing heart.
In the year after leaving Egypt, the relationship of the children of Israel with Jehovah could be described as inconsistent. And yet, as you read Exodus 35:4–35 and 36:1–7, notice how the Israelites responded to the commandment to build the tabernacle. What do you learn from the Israelites that could help you better serve the Lord?

He may not ask you for precious metals, linens, or wood for a tabernacle. What has the Lord given you, and what is He asking you to offer? When has your “heart stirred [you] up to come unto the work”?

Exodus 40:12–14

Temple ordinances were given anciently.
Exodus 40:12–14 refers to ancient ordinances that are also administered in our day in the house of the Lord. Here are some additional verses that can help you learn about how these ordinances testify of Jesus Christ:

Washing: Psalm 51:2; Ezekiel 36:25–27

Clothing in holy garments: Isaiah 61:10; Matthew 22:11–14; Revelation 19:7–8

Anointing: Luke 4:18–19; Acts 10:38

Leviticus 1:1–9; 4; 16

Because of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, I can be forgiven.
Much of the book of Leviticus may seem strange to us—animal sacrifices, rituals involving blood and water, and laws governing small details of life. But these rituals and laws were meant to teach principles that are familiar—repentance, holiness, and the Savior’s Atonement. To find these principles as you read Leviticus 1:1–9; 4; 16, consider questions like these:

What words or phrases do I find that remind me of Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice?

What do I learn from these sacrifices about the Savior’s sacrifice?

How am I like the people who made these sacrifices?

The Lord doesn’t require animal sacrifices anymore. But sacrifice is still an important principle of the gospel. To learn about the kinds of sacrifice the Lord does require, study 3 Nephi 9:19–20; Doctrine and Covenants 64:34. How are you offering these kinds of sacrifices? What does Moses 5:7 teach you about how you should view your sacrifices?

Ideas for Teaching Children
Exodus 35:20–29; 36:1

God has given me gifts to help with His work.
At the end of this outline is a picture of the Israelites’ wilderness tabernacle. You might want to look at it with your children and ask them what materials would have been needed to build the tabernacle. Then you could read together Exodus 35:20–29 to find out how these materials were provided. How has the Lord invited us to contribute to building His kingdom?

Consider reading with them Exodus 36:1 to find out what the Lord gave Bezaleel and Aholiab to help build the tabernacle. You could then talk with your children about what you feel the Lord has given them to help build His kingdom. How can we use these things to bless others?

Exodus 40:17–34

I can feel the Lord’s presence in holy places.
Exodus 40:17–34 lists things that were part of the Israelites’ tabernacle. Maybe you and your children could find them in these verses and in the picture of the tabernacle at the end of this outline. Talk about how each part of the tabernacle could teach about the Savior or Heavenly Father. For example, the ark of testimony could remind us of God’s commandments, the altar could remind us of Jesus Christ’s sacrifice, and so on.

What holy places do we have today that help us feel closer to Jesus Christ? As part of this conversation, you could watch together the video “Temples” (Gospel Library). You could also sing a song like “Holy Places” (Gospel Library). Share with each other how you feel about sacred places like the temple.

What Is a Temple?

Leviticus 1:1–4

Because of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, I can be forgiven.
The animal sacrifices described in the Old Testament were meant to teach the children of Israel about forgiveness through Jesus Christ. Consider how reading about these sacrifices could do the same for your children. You could show pictures of Jesus Christ in Gethsemane and on the cross (see Gospel Art Book, nos. 56, 57) as you read with the children Leviticus 1:1–4. Help them find words or phrases that remind them of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

You might also read together 3 Nephi 9:19–20 to find out what we are commanded to sacrifice instead of animals. What does it mean to offer a broken heart and contrite spirit to the Lord? See Guide to the Scriptures, “Broken Heart” (Gospel Library) for help answering this question.
