August 24–30: “I Will Declare What He Hath Done for My Soul”

Psalms 49–51; 61–66; 69–72; 77–78; 85–86
The writers of the Psalms shared deeply personal feelings in their poetry. They wrote about feeling discouraged, afraid, and remorseful. At times, they even felt abandoned by God, and some psalms carry a tone of frustration or desperation. If you’ve ever felt that way, reading the Psalms can help you know that you aren’t the only one. But you’ll also find psalms that can encourage you when you’re having such feelings, because the psalmists also praised the Lord for His goodness, marveled at His power, and rejoiced in His mercy. They knew that we are burdened by evil and sin but that the Lord is “good, and ready to forgive” (Psalm 86:5). They understood that having faith in the Lord doesn’t mean that you’ll never struggle with anxiety, sin, or fear. It means that you know who to turn to when you do.

Psalms 49; 62:5–12

Redemption comes only through Jesus Christ.
Psalm 49 has a message for “both low and high, rich and poor” (verse 2). What would you say this message is? What do you feel Psalm 62:5–12 adds to that message?

Reading these psalms might inspire you to ponder the ways we are tempted to trust something other than God for redemption (see Psalm 49:6–7). How is your life influenced by your testimony that “God will redeem [your] soul from the power of the grave”? (Psalm 49:15).

Psalms 51; 85–86

seminary iconBecause of the Savior’s mercy, I can be forgiven.
King David wrote Psalm 51 after he recognized his desperate need for forgiveness—something we all need. Which verses describe feelings you’ve had? What do you find in this psalm that gives you hope for forgiveness?

You might also search Psalm 51 for clues about what it means to repent. Make a list of what you find. See if you can add to your list by searching President Russell M. Nelson’s message “We Can Do Better and Be Better” (Ensign or Liahona, May 2019, 67–69).

How would you describe what it feels like to receive forgiveness through Christ? If you need help describing your feelings, you could look in Psalms 51:1–2, 7–12; 85:2–9. Some people like to draw or find pictures to express their feelings; you might try that. You could also sing or listen to a hymn about the Savior, such as “I Stand All Amazed” (Hymns, no. 193).

To repent, we need faith not only that Jesus Christ can cleanse us but also that He will. What do you find in Psalm 86:5, 13, 15 that helps you know the Savior is both able and willing to forgive?

See also Alma 36; Peter F. Meurs, “He Could Heal Me!,” Liahona, May 2023, 39–41.

Psalms 51:13–15; 66:5–20; 71:15–24

My testimony of Jesus Christ can help others come unto Him.
Ponder how you gained your testimony of Jesus Christ and His atoning power. Then, as you study Psalms 51:13–15; 66:5–20; 71:15–24, think about how you can invite others to “come and see the works of God” (Psalm 66:5). If you were to “declare what [the Lord] hath done for [your] soul” (Psalm 66:16), what would you declare?

What does it mean to you to “talk of [His] righteousness all the day long”? (Psalm 71:24).

See also Alma 26.

“Come and hear, … and I will declare what [God] hath done for my soul” (Psalm 66:16).

Psalms 63; 69; 77–78

The Lord will help me in my time of need.
Several psalms describe what it’s like to feel distant from God and desperately need His help (see Psalms 63:1, 8; 69:1–8, 18–21; 77:1–9). In Psalms 63; 69; 77–78, what do you find that gave the psalmists reassurance?

When you are distressed, how does it help you to “remember the works of the Lord” and His “wonders of old”? (Psalm 77:11). Some of those wonders are described in Psalm 78. As you read about them, ponder what helps you “set [your] hope in God” (verse 7).

Ideas for Teaching Children
Because this Sunday is the fifth Sunday of the month, Primary teachers are encouraged to use learning activities in “Appendix B: Preparing Children for a Lifetime on God’s Covenant Path.”

Psalms 51; 86:5, 13, 15

When I make a wrong choice, Jesus can help me change.
To help your children discover truths about repentance in Psalm 51, you could draw a large heart. Then you could help your children write inside the heart bad things Satan tempts us to do. How do we get these things out of our hearts? Ask your children to find the word “heart” in Psalm 51:10, 17. Talk about what these verses teach about repentance. Let your children erase the words inside the heart and write new words that describe the ways Jesus can change us when we repent.

You might want to help your children learn what it means to have “a broken and a contrite heart” (Psalm 51:17). They could take turns breaking open something that has a hard shell, such as an egg or a nut. You could help them compare the shell to things that keep us from feeling Heavenly Father’s love. How can we open our heart to Him?

You could also look at a picture of the Savior together and ask your children what words they would use to describe Him. Invite them to find words that describe Him in Psalm 86:5, 13, 15. Why is it important to know these things about Him?

Psalm 61:2–3

Jesus Christ is my rock.
Your children might enjoy drawing pictures of the symbols in Psalm 61:2–3. How is Jesus Christ like a high “rock” (verse 2), “a shelter,” and “a strong tower”? (verse 3).

“Thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower” (Psalm 61:3).

Psalms 66:16; 77:11; 78:6–7

“I will remember the works of the Lord.”
Ask your children to share some of their favorite scripture stories (pictures from the Gospel Art Book might help). What do these stories teach us about the Lord? You could read together Psalm 66:16 and take turns answering the question “What has the Lord done for my soul”?

As you read Psalms 77:11; 78:6–7 together, you could share with each other how you try to “remember the works of the Lord” (Psalm 77:11), including His works in your life. How does the sacrament help us “always remember”? (Moroni 4:3; 5:2).

Psalm 71:8

I can tell others about Jesus Christ.
After reading Psalm 71:8 with your children, invite them to draw a large mouth. Ask them to help you “fill” the mouth with pictures or words representing things we can tell others about Jesus Christ.

You could pass around a picture of Jesus Christ. The person holding the picture could say one thing they know about Him. How can we help other people know these things?

Children have much to share. “When children learn something new, they naturally want to share it with others. Encourage this desire by giving children opportunities to teach gospel principles to each other, their family members, and their friends. Also ask them to share with you their thoughts, feelings, and experiences related to the principles you are teaching. You will find that they have insights that are simple, pure, and powerful” (Teaching in the Savior’s Way, 32).

Psalm 86:7

Heavenly Father hears and answers my prayers.
Many of the psalms are like prayers to God. As you read Psalms with your children, you might show them things we can use to communicate with people who are far away, such as a phone or a letter. Then read Psalm 86:7. How do we “call upon” Heavenly Father? How does He answer us?

You could sing together a song about prayer, such as “A Child’s Prayer” (Children’s Songbook, 12–13; see also Susan H. Porter, “Pray, He Is There,” Liahona, May 2024, 77–79). Tell each other about times when God answered your prayers.
