July 6–12. “There Is a Prophet in Israel”: 2 Kings 2–7

July 6–12: “There Is a Prophet in Israel”

2 Kings 2–7
A prophet’s main mission is to teach and testify of the Savior Jesus Christ. Our record of the prophet Elisha, however, doesn’t include much of his teaching or testifying. What the record does include is the miracles Elisha performed, including raising a child from the dead (see 2 Kings 4:18–37), feeding a multitude with just a little food (see 2 Kings 4:42–44), and healing a leper (see 2 Kings 5:1–14). So while we don’t have Elisha’s words about Christ, we do have Elisha’s ministry and miracles, which do testify of Christ. They are powerful manifestations of the Lord’s life-giving, nourishing, and healing power. Miracles happen more often in our lives than we sometimes realize. To see them, we need to seek the faith Elisha had when he prayed on behalf of his fearful young servant: “Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see” (2 Kings 6:17).

Ideas for Learning at Home and at Church
2 Kings 2–6

God can work miracles in my life.
Miracles show us God’s power. They can help us overcome the difficulties of mortality—like a barren land that needs pure water (see 2 Kings 2:19–22) or a lost ax that needs to be recovered (see 2 Kings 6:4–7). But most importantly, miracles can turn us to the Lord. As you read 2 Kings 2–6, consider listing the miracles you find, and ponder the spiritual lessons you learn from each one.

You might also compare the miracles Elisha performed with miracles that Jesus Christ performed (see 2 Kings 4:8–37 and Luke 7:11–16; 2 Kings 4:42–44 and John 6:1–13; 2 Kings 5:1–15 and Luke 17:11–19). What do these miracles teach you about the Savior and His prophets?

See also 2 Nephi 26:12–13; 27:23; Moroni 7:35–37; the section “Seek and expect miracles” in Russell M. Nelson, “The Power of Spiritual Momentum,” Liahona, May 2022, 99–100.

2 Kings 4:8–17; 7:1–16

The Lord will fulfill His words given through His prophets.
The Lord inspired Elisha to prophesy of things to come—usually, things that seemed unlikely to occur. As you read 2 Kings 4:8–17; 7:1–16, think about how you respond to the word of the Lord through His prophets today. What teachings, prophecies, or promises have you heard from living prophets? What are you doing to act in faith on their words?

2 Kings 5

As I am humble and obedient, Jesus Christ can heal me.
As you read 2 Kings 5, consider comparing Naaman’s leprosy with a spiritual challenge you are facing.

Is there someone like the “little maid” in your life, encouraging you to seek guidance about your challenge from the Lord’s prophets? (see verses 2–3, 13).

What is the Lord inviting you to do that might seem too simple—like “wash, and be clean”? (verse 13). What might be keeping you from accepting His simple invitations?

How can you show humility as Naaman did?

Note how Naaman’s experience affected his faith in the God of Israel (see verse 15). What can you learn from this?

See also Luke 4:27; 1 Peter 5:5–7; Alma 37:3–7; Ether 12:27; L. Whitney Clayton, “Whatsoever He Saith unto You, Do It,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2017, 97–99; “Naaman and Elisha” (video), Gospel Library.

Compare the scriptures to your life. Sometimes it’s easier to find personal meaning in the scriptures when you compare physical things in a story with spiritual things in your life. For example, while you study 2 Kings 2–7, you could compare situations in your life to things like leprosy, a borrowed ax, the Jordan River, or a large invading army. What lessons might the Lord have for you in these accounts?

2 Kings 6:8–23

seminary icon“They that be with us are more than they that be with them.”
As you try to follow Christ, have you ever felt like Elisha’s young servant—outnumbered and fearful? Imagine you were in his place as you read 2 Kings 6:8–23. How does this story change the way you think and feel about your trials, your responsibilities, or your efforts to live the gospel?

As you ponder, consider President Henry B. Eyring’s words: “Like that servant of Elisha, there are more with you than those you can see opposed to you. Some who are with you will be invisible to your mortal eyes. The Lord will bear you up and will at times do it by calling others to stand with you” (“O Ye That Embark,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2008, 58).

Consider making a list of “they that be with [you]” (verse 16)—people God has placed in your life to support you. You might ask Him to help you identify them by opening your spiritual eyes. He has probably also placed you in others’ lives to help them. How can you draw strength and support from each other?

When have you felt the support that the Lord describes in Doctrine and Covenants 84:88?

You might also study Sister Michelle D. Craig’s message “Eyes to See” (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2020, 15–17). Ask yourself, “What does God want me to see?”

Referring to the story in 2 Kings 6:8–23, Elder Ronald A. Rasband said: “We may or may not have chariots of fire sent to dispel our fears and conquer our demons, but the lesson is clear. The Lord is with us, mindful of us and blessing us in ways only He can do. Prayer can call down the strength and the revelation that we need to center our thoughts on Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice. The Lord knew that at times we would feel fear. I have been there and so have you. … In this Church we may be few in number by the way the world counts influence, but when we open our spiritual eyes, ‘they that be with us are more than they that be with them’ [2 Kings 6:16]” (“Be Not Troubled,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2018, 18, 19). How would you use these words to help someone who feels anxious or afraid?

Ideas for Teaching Children
2 Kings 4

God can work miracles in my life.
After helping your children understand what a miracle is, invite them to list as many examples of miracles as they can. Pictures in the Gospel Art Book or Come, Follow Me can help. Then they could look for miracles in 2 Kings 4:1–7, 14–17, 32–35, 38–44. What do these miracles teach about Heavenly Father?

You and your children could talk about how God has shown His love through miracles. You could also sing together a song such as “God’s Gracious Love” (Gospel Library).

2 Kings 5:1–15

I can choose to do what God commands through His prophet.
Help your children learn the story in 2 Kings 5:1–3, 9–14. Consider using “Elisha Heals Naaman” (in Old Testament Stories, 134–37) or the picture of Naaman in this week’s outline. Why didn’t Naaman want to wash in the Jordan River, even though Elisha said that this would heal his disease? How was Naaman blessed when he followed Elisha’s instructions? You might share with each other experiences when you obeyed the Lord, even when you weren’t sure you wanted to.

Elisha Heals Naaman

You might also emphasize 2 Kings 5:13, where Naaman’s servants helped him decide to obey the prophet Elisha. Your children could then talk about ways they can help their friends or family members listen to and obey the prophet.

2 Kings 6:8–17

I am not alone.
You and your children could imagine you are surrounded by an army with swords, horses, and chariots. How would you feel? What would you do? Your children could then close their eyes while you read 2 Kings 6:16–17 to them. (See also “Elisha and the Lord’s Army,” in Old Testament Stories, 138–39, or the picture at the end of this outline.) When you get to the words “open his eyes” (verse 17), ask the children to open their eyes. Talk about what the servant saw. Share with your children ways you have felt that the Lord was with you during your challenges, even when it seemed like you were alone.
