00:00:00.800 The Book of Mormon concludes with
00:00:02.800 inspiring invitations for Moroni to come
00:00:06.160 unto Christ, be perfected in him, deny
00:00:09.920 ourselves of all ungodliness,
00:00:12.559 and love God with all our might, mind,
00:00:14.960 and strength.
00:00:16.800 Interestingly, the final sentence of his
00:00:19.119 instruction anticipates both the
00:00:21.680 resurrection and final judgment. He
00:00:25.519 said, "I soon go to rest in the paradise
00:00:28.960 of God until my spirit and body shall
00:00:32.238 again reunite,
00:00:34.079 and I am brought forth triumphant
00:00:36.320 through the air to meet you before the
00:00:39.760 pleasing bar of the great Jehovah, the
00:00:43.680 eternal judge of both quick and dead."
00:00:47.440 I am intrigued by Moroni's use of the
00:00:50.000 word pleasing to describe the final
00:00:52.719 judgment.
00:00:54.239 Other Book of Mormon prophets likewise
00:00:56.480 describe the judgment as a glorious day
00:00:59.680 and one that we should look forward to
00:01:01.600 with an eye of faith. Yet often when we
00:01:05.600 anticipate judgment day, other prophetic
00:01:08.720 descriptions come to mind such as shame
00:01:12.400 and awful guilt, dread and fear, and
00:01:16.400 endless misery.
00:01:18.880 I believe this stark contrast in
00:01:20.960 language indicates that the doctrine of
00:01:24.000 Christ enabled Moroni and other prophets
00:01:27.680 to anticipate that great day with eager
00:01:30.560 and hopeful anticipation
00:01:33.360 instead of the fear they warned of for
00:01:35.439 those not spiritually prepared.
00:01:38.720 What did Moroni understand that you and
00:01:42.159 I need to learn? I pray for the
00:01:45.600 assistance of the Holy Ghost as we
00:01:48.079 consider Heavenly Father's plan of
00:01:50.159 happiness and mercy, the Savior's
00:01:52.880 atoning role in the Father's plan, and
00:01:55.920 how we will be accountable for our own
00:01:58.719 sins in the day of judgment.
00:02:02.880 The overarching purposes of the father's
00:02:05.200 plan are to provide his spirit children
00:02:08.080 with opportunities to receive a physical
00:02:10.318 body, learn good from evil through
00:02:12.959 mortal experience, grow spiritually, and
00:02:16.319 progress eternally.
00:02:18.800 What the Doctrine and Covenants refers
00:02:20.800 to as moral agency is central in God's
00:02:24.560 plan to bring to pass the immortality
00:02:27.120 and eternal life of his sons and
00:02:29.280 daughters.
00:02:31.120 This essential principle also is
00:02:33.280 described in the scriptures as agency
00:02:36.160 and the freedom to choose and to act.
00:02:39.760 The term moral agency is instructive.
00:02:44.080 Synonyms for the word moral include
00:02:46.400 good, honest, and virtuous.
00:02:49.360 Synonyms for the word agency include
00:02:51.680 action, activity, and work. Hence, moral
00:02:56.319 agency can be understood as the ability
00:02:59.599 and privilege to choose and act for
00:03:02.000 ourselves in ways that are good, honest,
00:03:05.840 virtuous, and true.
00:03:09.120 God's creations include both things to
00:03:11.680 act and things to be acted upon. And
00:03:15.120 moral agency is the divinely designed
00:03:18.080 power of independent action that
00:03:21.360 empowers us as God's children to become
00:03:23.680 agents to act and not simply objects to
00:03:27.120 be acted upon.
00:03:30.080 The earth was created as a place whereon
00:03:32.319 Heavenly Father's children could be
00:03:34.080 proved to see if they would do all
00:03:36.720 things whatsoever the Lord their God
00:03:38.879 shall command them. A primary purpose of
00:03:42.159 the creation and of our mortal existence
00:03:45.280 is to provide us the opportunity to act
00:03:48.239 and become what the Lord invites us to
00:03:51.280 become.
00:03:52.959 The Lord instructed Enoch.
00:03:55.599 Behold, these thy brethren, they are the
00:03:57.680 workmanship of mine own hands, and I
00:04:00.799 gave unto them their knowledge in the
00:04:03.439 day I created them. and in the Garden of
00:04:06.560 Eden gave I unto man his agency.
00:04:11.360 And unto thy brethren have I said, and
00:04:13.920 also given commandment, that they should
00:04:16.959 love one another, and that they should
00:04:19.358 choose me their father.
00:04:22.639 The fundamental purposes for the
00:04:24.960 exercise of agency are to love one
00:04:27.280 another and to choose God. And these two
00:04:31.440 purposes align precisely with the first
00:04:34.639 and second great commandments. To love
00:04:37.199 God with all our heart, soul, and mind,
00:04:40.000 and to love our neighbor as ourselves.
00:04:44.080 Consider that we are commanded, not
00:04:47.199 merely admonished or counseledled, but
00:04:49.680 commanded to use our agency to love one
00:04:53.040 another and choose God.
00:04:56.080 May I suggest that in the scriptures the
00:04:59.199 modifying word moral is not merely an
00:05:02.720 adjective but perhaps also a divine
00:05:06.560 directive about how a how our agency
00:05:10.080 should be used.
00:05:12.720 A familiar hymn is titled choose the
00:05:14.639 right for a reason. We have not been
00:05:17.440 blessed with moral agency to do whatever
00:05:19.600 we want whenever we will. Rather,
00:05:22.800 according to the Father's plan, we have
00:05:24.800 received moral agency to seek after and
00:05:28.479 act in accordance with eternal truth. As
00:05:32.000 agents unto ourselves, we should engage
00:05:34.800 anxiously in good causes, do many things
00:05:37.919 of our own free will, and bring to pass
00:05:40.800 much righteousness.
00:05:43.360 The eternal importance of moral agency
00:05:45.680 is highlighted in the scriptural account
00:05:47.759 of the premortal council.
00:05:50.240 Lucifer rebelled against the father's
00:05:52.400 plan for his children and sought to
00:05:55.039 destroy the power of independent action.
00:05:58.240 Significantly, the devil's defiance was
00:06:00.880 focused directly on the principle of
00:06:02.960 moral agency.
00:06:05.039 God explained, "Wherefore, because Satan
00:06:08.319 rebelled against me and sought to
00:06:10.960 destroy the agency of man, I caused that
00:06:14.319 he should be cast down."
00:06:17.120 The adversar's selfish scheme was to
00:06:21.199 strip away from God's children the
00:06:23.039 capacity to become agents unto
00:06:25.120 themselves who could act in
00:06:27.280 righteousness.
00:06:29.039 His intent was to consign Heavenly
00:06:31.600 Father's children to be objects that
00:06:33.759 could only be acted upon.
00:06:37.919 President Don H. Jokes has emphasized
00:06:40.479 that the gospel of Jesus Christ invokes
00:06:43.280 invites us both to know something and to
00:06:47.199 become something through the righteous
00:06:50.160 exercise of moral agency.
00:06:53.120 He said, "Many Bible and modern
00:06:56.160 scriptures speak of a final judgment at
00:06:59.039 which all persons will be rewarded
00:07:01.120 according to their deeds or works or the
00:07:03.680 desires of their hearts.
00:07:06.479 But other scriptures enlarge upon this
00:07:08.639 by referring to our being judged by the
00:07:11.039 condition we have achieved.
00:07:14.319 The prophet Nephi describes the final
00:07:16.319 judgment in terms of what we have
00:07:18.000 become.
00:07:19.840 And if their works have been filthiness,
00:07:22.800 they must needs be filthy. And if they
00:07:26.720 be filthy, it must needs be that they
00:07:29.680 cannot dwell in the kingdom of God.
00:07:32.560 Moroni declares, "He that is filthy
00:07:36.800 shall be filthy still, and he that is
00:07:40.160 righteous shall be righteous still."
00:07:43.440 President Oaks continued, "From such
00:07:46.400 teachings, we conclude that the final
00:07:48.319 judgment is not just an evaluation of a
00:07:51.599 sum total of good and evil acts, what we
00:07:54.800 have done. It is an acknowledgment of
00:07:58.240 the final effect of our acts and
00:08:00.240 thoughts. What we have become.
00:08:05.599 Our works and desires alone do not and
00:08:08.000 cannot save us. After all we can do, we
00:08:12.319 are reconciled with God only through the
00:08:14.960 mercy and grace available through the
00:08:17.680 Savior's infinite and eternal atoning
00:08:20.000 sacrifice.
00:08:21.919 Elma declared, "Begin to believe in the
00:08:25.360 Son of God, that he will come to redeem
00:08:28.080 his people, and that he shall suffer and
00:08:30.960 die to atone for their sins, and that he
00:08:33.760 shall rise again from the dead, which
00:08:36.320 shall bring to pass the resurrection,
00:08:38.958 that all men shall stand before him to
00:08:41.279 be judged at the last and judgment day,
00:08:43.839 according to their works.
00:08:46.800 We believe that through the atonement of
00:08:49.279 Christ, all mankind may be saved by
00:08:53.200 obedience to the laws and ordinances of
00:08:55.760 the gospel.
00:08:57.839 How grateful we should be that our sins
00:09:02.000 and wicked deeds will not stand as a
00:09:04.880 testimony against us if we are truly
00:09:08.080 born again. Exercise faith in the
00:09:11.440 redeemer. Repent with sincerity of heart
00:09:14.560 and real intent and endure to the end.
00:09:20.480 Many of us may expect that our
00:09:22.000 appearance before the bar of the eternal
00:09:24.240 judge will be similar to a proceeding in
00:09:27.200 a worldly court of law. A judge will
00:09:30.720 preside. Evidence will be presented. A
00:09:34.560 verdict will be rendered. And we likely
00:09:38.000 will be uncertain and fearful until we
00:09:40.880 learn the eventual outcome.
00:09:43.680 But I believe such a characterization is
00:09:46.560 inaccurate.
00:09:49.040 Different from but related to the mortal
00:09:51.839 fears we often experience is what the
00:09:54.720 scriptures describe as godly fear or the
00:09:57.440 fear of the Lord.
00:09:59.440 Unlike worldly fear that causes alarm
00:10:02.000 and anxiety, godly fear invites into our
00:10:05.760 lives peace, assurance, and confidence.
00:10:09.760 Righteous fear encompasses a deep
00:10:11.839 feeling of reverence and awe for the
00:10:14.240 Lord Jesus Christ, obedience to his
00:10:17.120 commandments, anticipation of the final
00:10:19.839 judgment, and justice at his hand.
00:10:23.920 Godly fear grows out of a correct
00:10:25.920 understanding of the divine nature and
00:10:28.240 mission of the redeemer. A willingness
00:10:31.040 to submit our will to his will and a
00:10:34.480 knowledge that every man and woman will
00:10:37.200 be accountable for his or her own mortal
00:10:40.480 desires, thoughts, words, and acts in
00:10:44.480 the day of judgment.
00:10:46.880 The fear of the Lord is not a reluctant
00:10:50.079 apprehension about coming into his
00:10:53.040 presence to be judged.
00:10:55.360 Rather, it is the prospect of ultimately
00:10:58.320 acknowledging about ourselves things as
00:11:00.959 they really are and as they really will
00:11:04.399 be.
00:11:06.480 Every person who has lived, who does now
00:11:09.040 live, and who will yet live upon the
00:11:10.880 earth, shall be brought to stand before
00:11:13.600 the bar of God, to be judged of him
00:11:16.079 according to his or her works, whether
00:11:18.720 they be good or whether they be evil.
00:11:22.959 If our desires have been for
00:11:24.480 righteousness and our works good,
00:11:26.880 meaning we have exercised faith in Jesus
00:11:29.279 Christ, made and kept covenants with
00:11:32.079 God, and repented of our sins, then the
00:11:35.839 judgment bar will be pleasing.
00:11:39.839 As Enus declared, "We will stand before
00:11:42.240 the redeemer. Then shall we see his face
00:11:46.160 with pleasure, and at the last day, we
00:11:49.200 will be rewarded unto righteousness."
00:11:52.160 Conversely, if our desires have been for
00:11:54.800 evil and our works wicked, then the
00:11:58.399 judgment bar will be a cause of dread.
00:12:01.839 We will have a perfect knowledge, a
00:12:04.959 bright recollection, and a lively sense
00:12:07.360 of our own guilt.
00:12:09.680 We shall not dare to look up to our God,
00:12:12.399 God. And we would fain be glad if we
00:12:15.920 could command the rocks and the
00:12:17.519 mountains to fall upon us to hide us
00:12:20.320 from his presence.
00:12:22.480 And at the last day, we will have our
00:12:25.519 reward of evil.
00:12:28.240 Ultimately then, we are our own judges.
00:12:33.279 No one will need to tell us where to go.
00:12:36.800 In the Lord's presence, we will
00:12:38.399 acknowledge what we have chosen to
00:12:40.639 become in mortality and know for
00:12:43.360 ourselves where we should be in
00:12:45.760 eternity.
00:12:48.320 Understanding that the final judgment
00:12:50.079 can be pleasing is not a blessing
00:12:52.079 reserved only for Moroni.
00:12:54.639 Elma described promised blessings
00:12:56.560 available to every devoted disciple of
00:12:58.880 the Savior. He said
00:13:01.760 the meaning of the word restoration
00:13:04.320 is to bring back again evil for evil or
00:13:07.680 carnal for carnal or devilish for
00:13:10.480 devilish, good for that which is good,
00:13:13.680 righteous for that which is righteous,
00:13:16.079 just for that which is just, merciful
00:13:19.040 for that which is merciful.
00:13:21.600 Deal justly, judge righteously, and do
00:13:25.839 good continually. And if ye do all these
00:13:29.519 things, then shall ye receive your
00:13:32.399 reward. Yeah, ye shall have mercy
00:13:34.959 restored unto you again. Ye shall have
00:13:38.320 justice restored unto you again. Ye
00:13:41.760 shall have a righteous judgment restored
00:13:44.000 unto you again. And ye shall have good
00:13:47.760 rewarded unto you again.
00:13:52.000 I joyfully witness that Jesus Christ is
00:13:56.320 our living savior. Elma's promise is
00:13:59.360 true and applicable to you and me today,
00:14:03.120 tomorrow, and for all eternity. I so
00:14:06.880 testify in the sacred name of the Lord
00:14:09.600 Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
