00:00:01.439 Recently, I read of an experience that
00:00:03.840 touched me deeply. It took place at the
00:00:06.560 USA Masters Track and Field National
00:00:09.040 Championship, a competition for seniors.
00:00:12.320 One of the participants in the 1500
00:00:14.799 meter event was 100year-old Orville
00:00:17.840 Rogers. The Arthur writes, "When the
00:00:20.960 starter pistol fired, the runners took
00:00:23.279 off with Orville settling immediately
00:00:25.840 into last place where he remained alone
00:00:28.800 for the entire race, shuffling along
00:00:31.760 very slowly. When the last runner
00:00:34.559 besides Orville finished, Orville still
00:00:36.880 had two and a half laps to go. Nearly
00:00:39.760 3,000 spectators sat watching him slowly
00:00:43.600 make his way around the track,
00:00:45.920 completely, silently, and uncomfortably
00:00:49.280 alone. But when he began his final lap,
00:00:52.719 the crowd rose to their feet, cheering
00:00:54.719 and applauding. By the time he hit the
00:00:57.039 home stretch, the crowd was roaring.
00:00:59.600 With the cheering encouragement of
00:01:01.199 thousands of spectators, Orville called
00:01:03.520 on his last reserves of energy. The
00:01:06.479 crowd erupted with delight as he crossed
00:01:08.560 the finish line and was embraced by his
00:01:10.640 competitors. Orville humbly and
00:01:12.960 gratefully waved to the crowd and walked
00:01:15.439 off the track with his new friends.
00:01:18.479 This was Orville's fifth race of the
00:01:20.640 competition. And in each of the other
00:01:22.799 events, he had also taken last place.
00:01:25.759 Some might have been tempted to judge
00:01:27.439 Orville, thinking that he shouldn't have
00:01:28.960 even competed at his age, that he didn't
00:01:31.439 belong on the track because he greatly
00:01:33.520 prolonged his events for everyone else.
00:01:36.880 But even though he always finished last,
00:01:39.840 Orville broke five world records that
00:01:42.720 day.
00:01:44.320 No one watching him race would have
00:01:46.159 believed that possible, but neither the
00:01:48.479 spectators nor his competitors were the
00:01:51.040 judges. Orville didn't break any rules
00:01:54.159 and the officials didn't lower any
00:01:56.000 standards. He ran the same race and
00:01:58.560 fulfilled the same requirements as all
00:02:00.479 the other competitors.
00:02:02.479 But his degree of difficulty, in this
00:02:05.280 case, his age and limited physical
00:02:07.360 capacity was factored in by placing him
00:02:10.000 in the 100 plus age division. And in
00:02:13.440 that division, he broke five world
00:02:16.640 records.
00:02:19.360 Just as it took Orville great courage to
00:02:21.920 step out on that track each time, it
00:02:24.480 also takes great courage for some of our
00:02:26.560 sisters and brothers to step into the
00:02:28.560 arena of life every day, knowing they
00:02:31.680 may be judged unfairly, even though
00:02:34.000 they're doing the best they can against
00:02:35.840 daunting odds to follow the Savior and
00:02:38.080 honor their covenants with him. No
00:02:40.800 matter where we live in the world, no
00:02:42.560 matter our age, it is a basic human need
00:02:45.840 for all of us to feel a sense of
00:02:47.920 belonging, to feel that we are wanted
00:02:50.080 and needed and that our lives have
00:02:51.760 purpose and meaning no matter our
00:02:54.319 circumstances or limitations.
00:02:57.200 On the last lap of the race, the crowd
00:02:59.360 overwhelmingly cheered Orville on,
00:03:01.360 giving him the strength to keep going.
00:03:03.920 It didn't matter that he finished last.
00:03:06.560 For the participants and the crowd, this
00:03:09.280 was about far more than a competition.
00:03:12.319 In many ways, this was a beautiful
00:03:14.800 example of the Savior's love in action.
00:03:18.080 When Orville finished, they all rejoice
00:03:21.280 together.
00:03:22.959 Just like the Master's Championship, our
00:03:25.280 congregations and families can be
00:03:27.280 gathering places where we cheer each
00:03:29.840 other on. Covenant communities fueled by
00:03:32.879 the love of Christ for one another.
00:03:35.280 Helping each other overcome whatever
00:03:37.360 challenges we face, giving each other
00:03:40.000 strength and encouragement without
00:03:41.920 judging one another. We need each other.
00:03:45.920 Divine strength comes from unity. And
00:03:48.239 that is why Satan is intent on dividing
00:03:50.799 us. Unfortunately for some of us,
00:03:54.640 attending church can be hard at times
00:03:56.879 for many different reasons. It could be
00:03:59.519 someone struggling with questions of
00:04:01.280 faith or someone with social anxiety or
00:04:04.000 depression. It could be someone from a
00:04:06.480 different country, race, or background
00:04:08.400 or someone with different life
00:04:09.920 experiences or ways of seeing things who
00:04:12.879 feel they don't fit the mold. It could
00:04:15.760 be someone mustering the courage to
00:04:17.600 return after years of being away or
00:04:20.238 someone with a nagging feeling that they
00:04:22.240 just don't measure up and will never
00:04:24.160 belong. It could even be sleepdeprived
00:04:27.440 and emotionally stretched parents of
00:04:29.360 babies and young children or someone
00:04:32.240 that's single in a congregation full of
00:04:35.360 marriage of families and couples.
00:04:39.520 President Russell M. Nelson has said,
00:04:42.240 "If a couple in your ward gets divorced
00:04:44.400 or a young missionary returns home early
00:04:47.120 or a teenager doubts his testimony, they
00:04:50.400 do not need your judgment. They need to
00:04:53.600 experience the pure love of Jesus Christ
00:04:56.240 reflected in your words and actions.
00:04:59.600 Our experience at church is meant to
00:05:01.680 provide vital connections with the Lord
00:05:03.840 and with each other that are so needed
00:05:06.320 for our spiritual and emotional
00:05:08.000 well-being.
00:05:09.440 Inherent in the covenants we make with
00:05:11.600 God, beginning with baptism, is our
00:05:14.240 responsibility to love and care for each
00:05:16.880 other as members of the family of God,
00:05:19.440 members of the body of Christ, and not
00:05:22.000 just to check off a box on a list of
00:05:24.240 things we're expected to do. Christlike
00:05:27.360 love and care are higher and holier. The
00:05:30.479 pure love of Christ is charity. As
00:05:33.600 President Nelson said, "Charity propels
00:05:36.800 us to bear one another's burdens rather
00:05:39.440 than heap burdens upon each other." The
00:05:42.880 Savior said, "By this shall all men know
00:05:46.000 that ye are my disciples, if ye have
00:05:49.039 love one to another." And President
00:05:51.759 Nelson added, "Charity is the principal
00:05:55.199 characteristic of a true follower of
00:05:57.199 Jesus Christ. The Savior's message is
00:06:00.000 clear. His true disciples build, lift,
00:06:03.520 encourage, persuade, and inspire. How we
00:06:06.240 speak to and about others really
00:06:08.080 matters. The Savior's teaching on this
00:06:10.639 is very simple. It's summed up in the
00:06:12.479 golden rule. Do unto others as you would
00:06:15.360 have others do unto you. Put yourself in
00:06:18.240 that person's place and treat them the
00:06:20.400 way you would want to be treated if you
00:06:22.479 were in their shoes. Christlike
00:06:24.960 treatment of others goes far beyond our
00:06:26.960 families and congregations. It includes
00:06:29.600 our sisters and brothers of other faiths
00:06:31.919 or no faith at all. It includes our
00:06:34.800 brothers and sisters from other
00:06:36.479 countries and cultures as well as those
00:06:39.360 of other political persuasions.
00:06:42.080 We are all part of the family of God and
00:06:44.720 he loves all his children. He desires
00:06:47.759 that his children love him and also one
00:06:50.880 another. The Savior's life was an
00:06:53.360 example of loving, gathering, and
00:06:55.199 lifting even those who society had
00:06:57.039 judged as outcasts and unclean. His is
00:07:00.000 an example we are commanded to follow.
00:07:02.400 We are here to develop Christlike
00:07:04.240 attributes and eventually become like
00:07:06.160 our savior. His is not a gospel of
00:07:09.360 checklist. It is a gospel of becoming,
00:07:12.960 becoming as he is and loving as he does.
00:07:16.720 He wants us to become a Zion people.
00:07:19.759 When I was in my late 20s, I went
00:07:22.319 through a period of deep depression. And
00:07:24.400 during that time, it was as if the
00:07:26.400 reality that God existed was suddenly
00:07:29.120 gone. I can't fully explain the feeling
00:07:32.000 other than to say I felt completely
00:07:34.479 lost. From the time I was a young child,
00:07:38.319 I had always known that my father in
00:07:40.560 heaven was there and that I could talk
00:07:42.240 to him. But during that time, I no
00:07:45.840 longer knew if there was a God. I'd
00:07:48.960 never experienced anything like that
00:07:50.720 before in my life, and it felt like my
00:07:53.199 whole foundation was crumbling. As a
00:07:56.000 result, it was hard for me to attend
00:07:57.919 church. I went, but it was partly
00:08:00.560 because I was afraid of being labeled
00:08:02.400 inactive or less faithful, and I was
00:08:05.520 afraid of becoming someone's assigned
00:08:08.000 project. What I really needed during
00:08:10.879 that time was to feel genuine love,
00:08:13.280 understanding, and support from those
00:08:15.039 around me, not judgment. Some of the
00:08:17.919 assumptions I was afraid people would
00:08:19.919 make about me, I myself had made about
00:08:22.240 others when they didn't regularly attend
00:08:24.879 church. That painful personal experience
00:08:28.000 taught me some valuable lessons about
00:08:30.000 why we've been commanded not to judge
00:08:32.719 one another unrighteously.
00:08:35.039 Are there those who among us who suffer
00:08:37.360 in silence, afraid for others to know
00:08:40.240 their hidden struggles because they
00:08:42.159 don't know what the reaction will be?
00:08:44.720 Only the Lord fully knows the actual
00:08:46.800 level of difficulty with which each of
00:08:48.800 us is running our race of life. The
00:08:51.279 burdens, the challenges, and the
00:08:53.040 obstacles we face that often cannot be
00:08:56.000 seen by others. Only he fully
00:08:58.880 understands the life-changing wounds and
00:09:01.120 trauma some of us may have experienced
00:09:03.519 in the past that are still affecting us
00:09:06.240 in the present. Often we even judge
00:09:08.880 ourselves harshly, thinking we should be
00:09:10.880 much farther ahead on the track. Only
00:09:13.760 the Lord fully knows our individual
00:09:15.760 limitations and capacity. And because of
00:09:18.560 that, he is the only one fully qualified
00:09:20.959 to judge our performance. Sisters and
00:09:23.760 brothers, let's be like those spectators
00:09:25.600 in the story and cheer each other on in
00:09:27.760 our journey of disciplehip, no matter
00:09:30.160 our circumstances. That doesn't require
00:09:32.800 us to break rules or lower standards.
00:09:35.839 It's actually the second great
00:09:37.680 commandment to love our neighbor as
00:09:40.320 ourselves. And as our Savior has said,
00:09:43.519 in as much as ye have done it unto one
00:09:45.440 of the least of these, ye have done it
00:09:47.920 unto me, for good or for ill. He has
00:09:52.399 also told us, if you're not one, ye are
00:09:55.680 not mine. There will be times in each of
00:09:58.560 our lives when we will be the ones who
00:10:00.240 need help and encouragement. Let's
00:10:02.160 commit now to always do that for each
00:10:04.480 other. As we do, we will develop greater
00:10:07.600 unity and facilitate a space for the
00:10:10.240 Savior to do his sacred work of healing
00:10:13.279 and transforming each of us. To those of
00:10:16.560 you who may feel you have lagged far
00:10:18.480 behind in this race of life, this
00:10:20.399 journey of mortality, please keep going.
00:10:24.160 Only the Savior can fully judge where
00:10:26.160 you should be at this point. And he is
00:10:28.320 compassionate and just. He is the great
00:10:31.519 judge of the race of life and the only
00:10:33.279 one who fully understands the level of
00:10:35.760 difficulty with which you are running or
00:10:38.800 walking or shuffling. He will take into
00:10:42.079 account your limitations, your capacity,
00:10:44.399 your life experiences, and the hidden
00:10:46.800 burdens you carry as well as the desires
00:10:49.680 of your heart. You may actually be
00:10:52.640 breaking symbolic world records as well.
00:10:56.000 Please don't lose hope. Please keep
00:10:58.000 going. Please stay. You do belong. The
00:11:01.920 Lord needs you and we need you. Wherever
00:11:05.200 you live in the world, no matter how
00:11:08.000 remote it may be, please always remember
00:11:10.079 that your father in heaven and your
00:11:11.760 savior know you completely and love you
00:11:14.399 perfectly. You are never forgotten to
00:11:16.640 them. They want to bring you home. Keep
00:11:19.680 your eye on the Savior. He is your iron
00:11:21.920 rod. Don't let go of him. I testify that
00:11:24.720 he lives and that you can trust him. I
00:11:27.519 also testify that he is cheering you on.
00:11:31.200 May we all follow the Savior's example
00:11:33.120 and cheer each other on is my prayer in
00:11:35.839 the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
00:11:38.399 Amen.
