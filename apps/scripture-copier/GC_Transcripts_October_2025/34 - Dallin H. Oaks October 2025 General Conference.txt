00:00:00.880 My loving brothers and sisters,
00:00:04.319 thank you for your prayers in my behalf.
00:00:07.520 I have felt them.
00:00:11.679 The doctrine of the Church of Jesus
00:00:13.840 Christ of Latter-day Saints centers on
00:00:17.039 the family.
00:00:19.119 Essential to our doctrine on the family
00:00:22.640 is the temple.
00:00:25.119 The ordinances received there enable us
00:00:28.640 to return as eternal families to the
00:00:32.640 presence of our heavenly father.
00:00:37.040 As of the April 2025 general conference,
00:00:42.480 President Russell M. Nelson had
00:00:45.280 announced the construction of 200 new
00:00:49.920 temples.
00:00:51.920 He loved to announce new temples at the
00:00:55.039 conclusion of each general conference
00:00:58.559 and we all rejoiced with him.
00:01:02.879 However, with the large number of
00:01:04.799 temples now in the very earliest phases
00:01:08.159 of planning and construction,
00:01:11.439 it is appropriate that we slow down the
00:01:14.960 announcement of new temples.
00:01:18.560 Therefore, with the approval of the
00:01:21.119 quorum of the twelve apostles,
00:01:23.840 we will not announce any new temples at
00:01:28.000 this conference.
00:01:31.200 We will now move forward in providing
00:01:33.680 the ordinances of the temple to members
00:01:36.320 of the church throughout the world,
00:01:39.600 including when and where to announce the
00:01:44.720 construction of new temples.
00:01:53.680 The portion of my talk
00:01:57.360 that I have just delivered was written
00:02:00.000 after the death of our beloved President
00:02:02.719 Russell M. Nelson.
00:02:06.000 What follows now was written and
00:02:08.479 approved weeks before,
00:02:12.080 but it still represents my teachings
00:02:15.599 inspired by the Lord.
00:02:20.319 The family proclamation announced
00:02:23.120 exactly 30 years ago
00:02:26.080 declares that the family is ordained of
00:02:28.800 God and is central to the creator's plan
00:02:33.360 for the eternal destiny of his children.
00:02:37.360 It also declares that God's commandment
00:02:40.879 for his children to multiply and
00:02:43.360 replenish the earth remains in force.
00:02:47.920 And we further declare that God has
00:02:51.519 commanded that the sacred powers of
00:02:54.879 procreation
00:02:56.480 are to be employed only between man and
00:02:59.200 woman lawfully wedded as husband and
00:03:02.720 wife.
00:03:06.239 As then Elder Russell M. Nelson taught a
00:03:09.680 BYU audience,
00:03:12.239 "The family is quote pivotal to God's
00:03:16.000 plan.
00:03:17.599 In fact, a purpose of the plan is to
00:03:21.599 exalt the family end of quote."
00:03:26.720 The church of Jesus Christ is sometimes
00:03:29.599 known as a family centered church. It is
00:03:35.200 our relationship to God and the purpose
00:03:37.760 of our mortal life are explained in
00:03:40.720 terms of the family.
00:03:43.519 The gospel of Jesus Christ is the plan
00:03:46.959 of our heavenly father for the benefit
00:03:50.080 of his spirit children.
00:03:53.040 We can truly say that the gospel plan
00:03:56.480 was first taught to us in the council of
00:03:59.840 an eternal family.
00:04:02.400 It is implemented through our mortal
00:04:05.519 families
00:04:07.200 and its intended destiny is to exalt the
00:04:11.360 children of God in eternal families.
00:04:16.880 Despite that doctrinal context, there is
00:04:20.320 opposition.
00:04:22.479 In the United States, we are suffering
00:04:25.600 from a deterioration in marriage and
00:04:29.040 childbearing.
00:04:31.440 For nearly a hundred years, the
00:04:33.440 proportion of households headed by
00:04:35.840 married couples has declined
00:04:39.759 and so has the birth rate.
00:04:43.040 The marriages and birth rates of our
00:04:45.840 church members are much more positive,
00:04:49.120 but they have also declined
00:04:52.800 significantly.
00:04:55.759 It is vital that Latter-day Saints do
00:04:58.400 not lose their understanding of the
00:05:00.960 purpose of marriage and the value of
00:05:04.160 children.
00:05:05.919 That is the future for which we strive.
00:05:10.800 Exaltation is a family affair.
00:05:14.560 President Nelson has taught us,
00:05:18.080 quote, "Only through the saving
00:05:20.560 ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ
00:05:24.400 can families be exalted."
00:05:27.600 End of quote.
00:05:30.720 The national declines in marriage and
00:05:33.360 childbearing are understandable for
00:05:36.240 historic reasons,
00:05:38.720 but Latterday Saint values and practices
00:05:41.440 should improve, not follow those trends.
00:05:47.039 In my boyhood 70 years ago,
00:05:50.800 I lived on my parents grandparents' farm
00:05:55.360 in a setting where almost all that
00:05:57.840 happened during the day was under the
00:06:00.960 direction of the family.
00:06:03.759 There was no television or other
00:06:05.919 electronics to distract from family
00:06:08.720 activities.
00:06:10.960 In contrast, in today's urban society,
00:06:15.120 few members experience consistent family
00:06:19.280 centered activities.
00:06:21.680 Urban living and modern transportation,
00:06:25.039 organized entertainment, and high-speed
00:06:27.840 communication
00:06:29.440 have made it easy for youth to treat
00:06:32.240 their homes as boarding houses where
00:06:34.800 they sleep and take an occasional meal,
00:06:38.080 but where there is far less parental
00:06:40.960 direction of their activities.
00:06:45.600 Parental influences have also been
00:06:47.919 diluted by the way in which most current
00:06:50.720 members of the church earn a living.
00:06:54.800 In times past, one of the great
00:06:58.160 influences that unified families was the
00:07:02.080 experience of struggling together in
00:07:04.319 pursuit of a common goal such as taming
00:07:07.440 the wilderness or earning a living.
00:07:11.039 The family was an organized and
00:07:13.919 conducted unit of economic production.
00:07:19.360 Today, most families are units of
00:07:21.919 economic consumption,
00:07:24.479 which does not require a high degree of
00:07:27.120 family organization and cooperation.
00:07:32.000 As parental influences diminish,
00:07:36.080 Latter-day Saints still have a God-given
00:07:38.880 responsibility to teach their children
00:07:41.919 to prepare for our family destiny in
00:07:45.360 eternity.
00:07:47.599 Many of us must do this when not all of
00:07:51.280 our families are traditional. Divorce,
00:07:56.639 death, and separation are realities.
00:08:02.160 I experienced that in the family in
00:08:05.919 which I was raised.
00:08:08.800 My father died when I was seven years
00:08:11.280 old.
00:08:12.960 So, my younger brother and sister and I
00:08:15.599 were raised by a widowed mother.
00:08:19.759 In the most difficult of situations, she
00:08:23.280 pressed on.
00:08:25.440 She was alone and broken, but with the
00:08:29.120 Lord's help, her powerful teaching of
00:08:32.479 the doctrine of the restored church
00:08:34.799 guided us. How she prayed for heavenly
00:08:38.880 assistance in raising her children
00:08:42.719 and she was blessed.
00:08:45.600 We were raised in a happy home in which
00:08:48.240 our deceased father was always a
00:08:51.440 reality.
00:08:53.360 She taught us that we had a father and
00:08:57.120 she had a husband and we would always be
00:09:00.160 a family because of their temple
00:09:02.480 marriage.
00:09:04.320 Our father was just away temporarily
00:09:07.839 because the Lord had called him to a
00:09:10.480 different work.
00:09:13.519 I know that many other families are not
00:09:16.160 so happy. But every single mother can
00:09:20.080 teach of the love of a heavenly father
00:09:23.600 and the eventual blessings of a temple
00:09:26.320 marriage. You too can do this.
00:09:30.880 Heavenly father's plan assures this
00:09:33.839 possibility for everyone.
00:09:39.120 We are all grateful for temple marriage
00:09:41.839 and for the prospective blessings of
00:09:44.160 being sealed as an eternal family.
00:09:49.360 Like my mother, we love to quote Lehi's
00:09:53.040 promise to his son Jacob that God shall
00:09:57.040 consecrate thine afflictions for thy
00:10:00.000 gain.
00:10:01.920 That applies to every Latter-day Saint
00:10:04.160 family, complete or currently
00:10:07.279 incomplete. We are a family church.
00:10:14.320 Our doctrine and our belief in eternal
00:10:16.880 families
00:10:18.640 strengthen and bond us.
00:10:21.760 I will never forget the promise of my
00:10:24.480 maternal grandfather Harris when we
00:10:28.079 children were living on his farm near
00:10:30.720 Pacin, Utah.
00:10:33.200 He gave me the tragic news that my
00:10:37.519 father had died in far away Denver,
00:10:41.279 Colorado.
00:10:43.760 I ran into the bedroom
00:10:46.880 and knelt beside the bed, crying my
00:10:50.240 heart out.
00:10:52.480 Grandpa followed me and went to his
00:10:54.720 knees beside me and said, "I will be
00:10:59.200 your father."
00:11:03.680 That tender promise is a powerful
00:11:05.920 example of what grandparents can do to
00:11:09.519 fill in the gaps when families lose or
00:11:13.760 are missing a member.
00:11:20.640 Parents single or married and others
00:11:24.000 like grandparents who fill that role for
00:11:26.480 children are the master teachers.
00:11:30.800 Their most effective teaching is by
00:11:33.760 example.
00:11:35.760 The family circle is the ideal place to
00:11:38.720 demonstrate and learn eternal values
00:11:42.240 such as the importance of marriage and
00:11:44.640 children, the purpose of life,
00:11:49.200 and the true source of joy.
00:11:52.959 It is also the best place to learn other
00:11:55.920 essential lessons of life such as
00:11:58.800 kindness, forgiveness, self-control,
00:12:03.040 and the value of education and honest
00:12:06.639 work.
00:12:09.200 Of course, many fa church members have
00:12:11.760 beloved family members who do not
00:12:14.720 embrace gospel values and expectations.
00:12:18.720 Such members need our love and patience.
00:12:22.800 In relating to one another, we should
00:12:24.959 remember that the perfection we seek is
00:12:28.639 not limited to the stressful
00:12:31.279 circumstances of mortality.
00:12:34.720 The great teaching in Doctrine and
00:12:36.639 Covenants section 138:es
00:12:40.560 57-59
00:12:43.519 assures us that repentance and spiritual
00:12:46.720 growth can continue in the spirit world
00:12:50.800 that follows mortality.
00:12:54.240 More important,
00:12:56.079 as families unite to strengthen one
00:12:58.480 another, we should all remember that the
00:13:01.920 sins and inevitable shortcomings all of
00:13:05.200 us experience in mortality
00:13:08.079 can be forgiven through repentance
00:13:12.160 because of the glorious and saving
00:13:14.560 atonement of Jesus Christ.
00:13:18.160 Our savior Jesus Christ is our ultimate
00:13:22.480 role model.
00:13:24.639 We will be blessed if we model our lives
00:13:27.839 after his teachings and self-sacrifice.
00:13:32.399 Following Christ and giving ourselves in
00:13:35.120 service to one another is the best
00:13:38.079 remedy for the selfishness and
00:13:40.959 individualism
00:13:42.480 that now seems so common.
00:13:46.720 Parents also have a duty to teach their
00:13:49.279 children practical knowledge apart from
00:13:52.160 gospel principles.
00:13:54.480 Families unite when they do meaningful
00:13:57.040 things together.
00:13:59.040 Family gardens build family
00:14:01.120 relationships.
00:14:02.959 Happy family experiences strengthen
00:14:05.600 family ties. Camping, sports activities,
00:14:10.079 and other recreation
00:14:12.240 are especially valuable to bond
00:14:15.279 families.
00:14:17.040 Families should organize family reunions
00:14:20.240 to remember ancestors
00:14:23.680 which lead to the temple.
00:14:26.720 Parents should educate children in the
00:14:28.800 basic skills of living, including
00:14:31.680 working in the yard and home.
00:14:34.560 Learning languages is a useful
00:14:36.959 preparation for missionary service and
00:14:39.440 for modern life.
00:14:42.000 The teachers of these subjects can be
00:14:44.480 parents or grandparents or members of
00:14:47.839 the extended family.
00:14:50.959 Families flourish when they learn as a
00:14:53.279 group and counsel together on all
00:14:55.839 matters of concern to the family and its
00:14:58.880 members.
00:15:01.199 Some may say, "But we have no time for
00:15:04.160 any of that."
00:15:06.079 To find time to do what is truly
00:15:08.480 worthwhile,
00:15:10.160 many parents will find that they can
00:15:12.560 turn their family on if they all turn
00:15:16.639 their technologies off.
00:15:21.120 And parents remember what those children
00:15:24.240 really want for dinner is time with you.
00:15:29.920 Great blessings come to families if they
00:15:32.480 pray together, kneeling night and
00:15:34.639 morning to offer thanks for blessings
00:15:38.000 and to pray over common concerns.
00:15:42.160 Families are also blessed as they
00:15:44.720 worship together in church services and
00:15:47.839 in other devotional settings.
00:15:50.880 Family bonds are also strengthened by
00:15:53.680 family stories,
00:15:55.759 creating family traditions,
00:15:58.480 and sharing sacred experiences.
00:16:02.079 President Spencer W. Kimell reminded us
00:16:04.560 that stories of inspiration from our own
00:16:08.560 lives and those of our forebears are
00:16:12.720 powerful teaching tools.
00:16:16.560 They are often the best sources of
00:16:18.639 inspiration for us and our posterity.
00:16:24.720 I testify of the Lord Jesus Christ who
00:16:27.680 is the only begotten son of God, our
00:16:30.480 eternal father.
00:16:32.800 He invites us to follow the covenant
00:16:35.120 path that leads to a heavenly family
00:16:38.800 reunion.
00:16:40.639 The sealing powers of the priesthood
00:16:42.959 directed by the keys restored in the
00:16:45.120 Kirtland Temple bring families together
00:16:48.800 for eternity.
00:16:50.959 They are currently being exercised in a
00:16:53.759 growing number of temples of the Lord
00:16:56.480 throughout the world.
00:16:59.040 This is real.
00:17:01.120 Let us be part of it. I pray in the name
00:17:04.720 of Jesus Christ.
00:17:07.199 Amen.
00:17:08.160 Amen.
