00:00:00.880 Welcome to general conference.
00:00:03.760 How grateful we are to be gathered.
00:00:07.520 As we anticipate these conference
00:00:09.599 proceedings, we are acutely aware of the
00:00:12.080 weeks leading up to it. We realize that
00:00:14.960 our hearts are mourning loss and some
00:00:16.880 feel uncertainty caused by violence or
00:00:20.480 tragedy throughout the world.
00:00:23.359 Even devout people gathered in sacred
00:00:25.680 spaces, including our hallowed chapel in
00:00:29.119 Michigan, have lost their lives or loved
00:00:32.719 ones. I speak from my heart, realizing
00:00:36.239 that many of your hearts are burdened by
00:00:38.399 what you,
00:00:40.239 your families, and our world have
00:00:41.760 undergone since last general conference.
00:00:45.440 Imagine
00:00:47.120 with me you're a young teenager in
00:00:49.039 Capernaum near the Sea of Galilee during
00:00:51.039 the ministry of Jesus Christ.
00:00:53.760 Word spreads of a rabbi, a teacher whose
00:00:57.039 message draws multitudes.
00:00:59.840 Neighbors plan to travel to a mount
00:01:01.920 overlooking the sea to hear him. You
00:01:05.360 join others walking the dusty roads of
00:01:07.439 Galilee.
00:01:08.960 Upon arrival, a large crowd gathered to
00:01:11.119 hear this Jesus surprises you. Some
00:01:14.000 quietly whisper, "Messiah." You listen.
00:01:18.080 His words touch your heart. On the long
00:01:21.119 walk home, you choose quiet over
00:01:23.840 conversation.
00:01:25.360 You ponder wondrous things, things that
00:01:27.360 transcend even the law of Moses. He
00:01:30.159 spoke of turning the other cheek and
00:01:31.920 loving your enemies. He promised,
00:01:35.040 "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they
00:01:37.680 shall be called the children of God." In
00:01:41.040 your reality, as you feel the weight of
00:01:42.799 difficult days, uncertainty and fear,
00:01:44.799 peace feels distant. Your pace quickens
00:01:48.079 as you arrive home breathless. Your
00:01:50.399 family gathers. Your father asks, "Tell
00:01:53.040 us what you heard and feel. You share
00:01:56.320 that he invited you to let your light
00:01:58.399 shine before others to seek
00:02:00.159 righteousness.
00:02:02.000 Even when persecuted,
00:02:04.159 your voice catches as you repeat,
00:02:07.040 "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they
00:02:08.959 shall be called the children of God."
00:02:11.840 You ask, "Can I truly become a
00:02:15.440 peacemaker?
00:02:16.959 When the world is in commotion, when my
00:02:19.920 heart is filled with fear, and when
00:02:22.319 peace seems so far away, your father
00:02:26.160 glances at your mother and answers
00:02:28.000 gently, "Yes."
00:02:31.200 We begin in the most basic place in our
00:02:35.120 hearts.
00:02:36.879 Then in our homes and families as we
00:02:39.920 practice their peacemaking can spread to
00:02:42.720 our streets and villages.
00:02:46.879 Fast forward 2,000 years. No need to
00:02:49.280 imagine this is our reality. Although
00:02:51.920 the pressures felt by today's rising
00:02:53.920 generation differ from those of the
00:02:55.680 young person in Galilee. Polarization,
00:02:58.640 secularization,
00:03:00.160 retaliation, road rage, outrage, and
00:03:03.360 social media pylons.
00:03:05.840 Both generations face cultures of
00:03:08.400 conflict and tension.
00:03:10.879 Gratefully, our young men and women are
00:03:13.519 similarly drawn to their sermon on the m
00:03:17.040 on the mount moments for the strength of
00:03:20.000 youth conferences,
00:03:22.000 seminary, and come follow me.
00:03:25.840 Here they receive the same enduring
00:03:27.920 invitations from the Lord to let their
00:03:30.480 light shine before others to seek
00:03:32.400 righteousness even when persecuted.
00:03:35.440 and to love their enemies. They also
00:03:38.319 receive encouraging words from living
00:03:40.319 prophets of the restoration.
00:03:42.799 Peacemakers needed disagree without
00:03:45.599 being disagreeable.
00:03:47.440 Replace contention and pride with
00:03:49.920 forgiveness and love. Build bridges of
00:03:53.599 cooperation and understanding, not walls
00:03:56.400 of prejudice or segregation.
00:03:59.760 And the same promise, blessed are the
00:04:01.680 peacemakers, for they shall be called
00:04:03.519 the children of God.
00:04:05.840 The hearts of today's rising generation
00:04:08.000 are filled with a testimony of Jesus
00:04:10.159 Christ and a hope for the future. Yet
00:04:13.760 they too ask, "Can I truly become a
00:04:17.199 peacemaker when the world is in
00:04:18.720 commotion? My heart is filled with fear
00:04:22.320 and peace seems so far away."
00:04:25.600 The resounding response is once again,
00:04:28.880 yes. We embrace the words of the Savior.
00:04:32.960 Peace I leave with you. My peace I give
00:04:35.919 unto you. Let not your heart be
00:04:38.160 troubled, neither let it be afraid.
00:04:42.240 Today, peacemaking still begins in the
00:04:45.280 most most basic place in our hearts,
00:04:50.240 then in homes and families. As we
00:04:54.160 practice there, peacemaking will spread
00:04:56.800 into our neighborhoods and communities.
00:05:00.800 Let's further consider three places
00:05:02.639 where modern Latter-day Saint can make
00:05:05.520 peace. The first is in our hearts. A
00:05:08.240 visible element of Christ's ministry
00:05:10.400 demonstrates how children were drawn to
00:05:12.560 him. Therein lies a clue. Looking into
00:05:16.080 the pure and innocent peacemaking heart
00:05:18.160 of a child can be an inspiration for our
00:05:21.360 hearts. Here is how several primary age
00:05:24.720 children answered, "What does it look
00:05:26.720 like to be a peacemaker?" I share their
00:05:29.440 responses freight straight from their
00:05:31.600 hearts. Luke said, "Always help others."
00:05:34.639 Grace shared how important it is to
00:05:36.400 forgive each other even when it doesn't
00:05:38.720 feel fair. Anna said, "I saw someone who
00:05:42.160 didn't have anyone to play with, so I
00:05:44.400 went to play with her." Lindy reflected
00:05:46.880 that to be a peacemaker is to help
00:05:49.199 others. Then you pass it on. It will
00:05:51.759 just go keep going on and on. Liam said,
00:05:54.800 "Don't be mean. Even if people are mean
00:05:57.680 to you, London exclaimed, "If someone
00:06:01.520 teases you or is mean to you, you say,
00:06:04.160 "Please stop." Trevor observed, "If
00:06:08.160 there is one donut left and you all want
00:06:10.319 it, you share."
00:06:13.280 These children's responses are evidence
00:06:16.000 to me that we are all born with divine
00:06:18.639 inclinations towards kindness and
00:06:21.199 compassion.
00:06:22.800 The gospel of Jesus Christ nurtures and
00:06:25.039 knits these divine traits including
00:06:27.199 peacemaking into our hearts blessing us
00:06:30.639 in this life and the next. Peacemaking
00:06:34.000 at home.
00:06:35.840 Second, building peacemaking in our
00:06:38.000 homes by using the Lord's pattern to
00:06:40.319 influence our relationships with one
00:06:42.240 another.
00:06:43.759 Persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness,
00:06:46.319 kindness, meekness, and love unfeigned.
00:06:49.680 Here is an inspiring story that
00:06:51.600 demonstrates how one family made
00:06:53.360 peacemaking a family affair, putting
00:06:55.600 these principles into practice. Children
00:06:58.400 in this family were struggling in their
00:07:00.319 relationship with an adult who was
00:07:02.400 demeanor was often grumpy,
00:07:04.080 condescending, and curt. The children,
00:07:07.120 hurt and frustrated, began to wonder if
00:07:09.360 the only way forward was to mirror that
00:07:12.240 same mean-spirited behavior. One
00:07:15.360 evening, the family spoke openly
00:07:17.919 together about the tension and toll it
00:07:20.080 was taking. And then an idea emerged.
00:07:23.759 Not just a solution, but an experiment.
00:07:27.360 Instead of responding with silence or
00:07:29.919 retaliation, the children would do
00:07:32.400 something unexpected. They would respond
00:07:34.960 with kindness. Not just polite con
00:07:38.400 restraint, but a deliberate, heartfelt
00:07:41.120 outpouring of kind words and thoughtful
00:07:43.440 deeds, no matter how they were treated
00:07:46.000 in return. All agreed to try it for a
00:07:48.800 set time, after which they'd regroup and
00:07:51.120 reflect. Though some were hesitant at
00:07:53.759 first, they committed to the plan with
00:07:56.000 genuine hearts. What happened next was
00:07:58.879 nothing short of remarkable. The cold
00:08:01.360 exchanges began to thaw. Smiles replace
00:08:04.560 scowls. The adult, once distant and
00:08:07.919 harsh, began to change. The children,
00:08:11.520 empowered by their choice to lead with
00:08:13.520 love, found joy in the transformation.
00:08:17.039 The change was so profound that the
00:08:19.520 planned follow-up meeting was never
00:08:21.759 needed. Kindness had done its quiet
00:08:24.800 work.
00:08:26.319 In time, true bonds of friendship were
00:08:28.879 formed, lifting everyone.
00:08:32.080 To be peacemakers, we forgive others and
00:08:34.880 deliberately build others up instead of
00:08:37.919 tearing them down.
00:08:40.240 Third, peacemaking in our communities.
00:08:44.240 In the troubled years of World War II,
00:08:46.720 Elder John A. Woodsto taught, "The only
00:08:49.600 way to build a peaceful community is to
00:08:51.680 build men and women who are lovers and
00:08:53.600 makers of peace.
00:08:55.600 Each individual by that doctrine of
00:08:58.000 Christ holds in his hands the peace of
00:09:01.680 the whole world.
00:09:03.680 The following story beautifully in
00:09:05.920 illustrates that precept.
00:09:08.320 Several years ago, two men, a Muslim,
00:09:10.720 Imam and a Christian pastor from
00:09:13.600 Nigeria, stood on opposite sides of a
00:09:16.800 painful religious divide. Each had
00:09:20.000 suffered deeply and yet through the
00:09:22.320 healing power of forgiveness they chose
00:09:25.440 to walk a path together.
00:09:28.240 Imam Muhammad Ashafa and Pastor James Wu
00:09:32.720 became friends and unlikely partners in
00:09:36.240 peace. Together they established a
00:09:38.720 center for interfaith mediation.
00:09:41.440 They now teach others to replace hatred
00:09:44.480 with hope. As two-time nominees for the
00:09:47.839 Nobel Peace Prize, they recently became
00:09:50.959 inaugural recipients of the Commonwealth
00:09:54.399 Peace Prize. These former enemies now
00:09:57.760 travel side by side, rebuilding what was
00:10:00.480 broken, living witnesses that the
00:10:02.959 Savior's invitation to be peacemakers is
00:10:05.839 not only possible, it is powerful.
00:10:10.160 When we come to know the glory of God,
00:10:12.800 then we will not have a mind to injure
00:10:15.279 one another, but to live peaceibly
00:10:19.040 in our congregations and our
00:10:20.959 communities. May we choose to see one
00:10:23.519 another as children of God.
00:10:27.360 In summary, I offer an invitation.
00:10:30.160 Peacemaking demands action. What might
00:10:33.120 that be for each of us starting
00:10:34.880 tomorrow? Would you consider a one-week
00:10:37.839 three-step peacemaker plan?
00:10:40.880 One, a contention-free home zone. When
00:10:44.720 contention starts, pause and reboot with
00:10:48.720 kind words and deeds.
00:10:51.360 Two, digital bridge building.
00:10:55.600 Before posting, replying, or commenting
00:10:58.240 online, ask, "Will this build a bridge?"
00:11:02.800 If not, stop. Do not send. Instead,
00:11:06.480 share goodness. Publish peace in the
00:11:10.160 place of hate.
00:11:12.320 Number three, repair and reunite.
00:11:16.160 Each family member could seek out a
00:11:18.079 strained relationship in order to
00:11:19.839 apologize,
00:11:21.360 minister, repair, and reunite.
00:11:26.240 It has been a few months since I felt an
00:11:28.480 undeniable impression leading to this
00:11:31.120 message. Blessed are the peacemakers.
00:11:34.320 In conclusion, may I share some
00:11:36.079 impressions that have pressed upon my
00:11:38.000 heart over this time.
00:11:41.839 Peacemaking is a Christlike attribute.
00:11:45.600 Peacemakers are sometimes labeled naive
00:11:48.079 or weak from all sides. Yet to be a
00:11:52.160 peacemaker is not to be weak, but to be
00:11:56.000 strong in a way the world may not
00:11:59.760 understand.
00:12:02.880 Peacemaking requires courage and
00:12:04.880 compromise
00:12:06.480 but does not require sacrifice of
00:12:09.440 principle.
00:12:11.200 Peacemaking is to lead with an open
00:12:14.000 heart, not a closed mind.
00:12:17.440 It is to approach one another with
00:12:19.680 extended hands, not clenched fists.
00:12:23.839 Peacemaking is not a new thing hot off
00:12:26.720 the press.
00:12:28.480 It was taught by Jesus Christ himself
00:12:32.160 both to those in the Bible and the Book
00:12:34.480 of Mormon.
00:12:36.160 Peacemakers has been taught by
00:12:37.839 modern-day prophets from the earliest
00:12:39.680 days of the restoration even to this
00:12:42.639 day. We fulfill our divine role as
00:12:45.839 children of a loving heavenly father. As
00:12:48.160 we strive to become peacemakers,
00:12:52.399 I bear testimony of Jesus Christ who is
00:12:54.639 the prince of peace, the son of the
00:12:57.200 living God. In the name of Jesus Christ.
00:13:00.800 Amen.
