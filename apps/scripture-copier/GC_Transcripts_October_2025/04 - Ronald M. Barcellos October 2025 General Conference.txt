00:00:01.120 When commanded to choose the new king of
00:00:03.280 Israel from among the sons of Jesse, the
00:00:05.759 prophet Samuel upon looking at Jesse's
00:00:08.000 oldest son, Elab, exclaimed with
00:00:10.320 enthusiasm,
00:00:11.840 surely the Lord's anointed is before
00:00:13.840 him. But Elab was not the Lord's chosen
00:00:16.880 servant. The Savior warned Samuel, "Look
00:00:20.080 not on his countenance or on the height
00:00:22.240 of his stature, because I have refused
00:00:24.640 them. For the Lord seeth not as man
00:00:27.039 seeth, for man lookth on the outward
00:00:29.840 appearance, but the Lord lookth on the
00:00:32.719 heart. While David may have not been
00:00:36.160 physically the strongest or most skilled
00:00:38.239 of his brothers, his heart was strong in
00:00:40.640 the sight of God. He loved God with all
00:00:43.520 his heart and had a deep desire to obey
00:00:45.920 him. He had unwavering faith in God's
00:00:48.719 love, power, and promised blessings, as
00:00:51.520 he later demonstrated when he fearlessly
00:00:53.840 fought and defeated Goliath with the
00:00:55.600 Lord's help. This story teaches us that
00:00:58.640 all God needs to accomplish his purposes
00:01:01.280 and to help us become who he wants us to
00:01:03.520 become is for each of us to turn our
00:01:06.159 hearts fully to him. To a lawyer, he
00:01:09.040 commanded, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy
00:01:11.280 God with all thy heart." To the prophet
00:01:14.000 Joseph Smith, he said, "Behold, the Lord
00:01:16.720 requireth the heart and a willing mind.
00:01:19.200 And to the Nephites, the resurrected
00:01:21.200 Savior extended this invitation, you
00:01:23.680 shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a
00:01:26.159 broken heart and a contrite spirit." Why
00:01:29.040 is that so? The Savior taught that if
00:01:31.759 our hearts are fully turned to him
00:01:33.759 because of his atoning sacrifice, we can
00:01:36.320 be blessed with the strength and
00:01:37.759 spiritual gifts we need to overcome our
00:01:40.159 mortal challenges, resist temptation,
00:01:43.040 receive direction and understanding, and
00:01:45.280 feel joy and peace in our lives. Out of
00:01:48.399 small things proceeded that which is
00:01:50.320 great. He said, "He can make weak things
00:01:53.200 become strong and bless us with
00:01:55.520 everything we need to succeed in this
00:01:57.439 mortal life and to receive eternal
00:01:59.759 life." "Blessed are the pure in heart,"
00:02:02.240 he said, "for they shall see God." I
00:02:05.600 believe this is why, at least in part,
00:02:07.920 Jesus Christ so often corrected the
00:02:09.840 scribes and Pharisees during his mortal
00:02:11.840 ministry. Though diligent in keeping his
00:02:14.560 law, they did so for the wrong reasons.
00:02:17.520 He rebuked them, saying, "This people
00:02:19.840 draweth nigh unto me with their mouth,
00:02:22.000 and honorth me with their lips, but
00:02:24.160 their heart is far from me." This is a
00:02:27.200 sober reminder to all his disciples that
00:02:29.920 it is not just about what we do, our
00:02:32.480 words and actions, but also why we do
00:02:35.200 what Jesus Christ has asked us to do,
00:02:37.440 our desires and motives. He said, "For
00:02:40.959 I, the Lord will judge all men according
00:02:43.599 to their works, according to the desire
00:02:46.000 of their hearts." Our heavenly father
00:02:48.480 desires more than mechanical acts of
00:02:50.480 obedience and service from his children.
00:02:53.040 He wants us to do those things with real
00:02:55.200 intent because we love him with all our
00:02:57.519 hearts. He wants us to desire to become
00:03:00.319 like him.
00:03:01.920 Now, if the spiritual health of our
00:03:03.920 hearts is a main concern of the Savior,
00:03:06.319 what he looks for in a true disciple,
00:03:08.720 how can we examine our hearts and know
00:03:11.120 if it is right in the sight of God?
00:03:13.840 Recently, as my wife and I returned from
00:03:16.159 our mission in Portugal, we ran a series
00:03:18.800 of health tests to evaluate our physical
00:03:20.959 condition. Some of those tests focused
00:03:23.360 on our heart's health, such as blood
00:03:25.440 tests, echo cardiograms, and stress
00:03:27.440 tests. I believe the Savior has also
00:03:30.560 provided us with a set of spiritual
00:03:32.879 tests we can use to assess our heart's
00:03:35.680 spiritual condition. Let me share a few
00:03:38.319 with you. First, our focus, priorities,
00:03:42.000 and motives. For where your treasure is,
00:03:45.360 there will your heart be also. Jesus
00:03:47.360 thought, a treasure is something
00:03:49.360 precious to us, something to which we
00:03:51.440 dedicate effort and attention. Where we
00:03:54.319 choose to spend our time and focus our
00:03:56.720 attention as well as what motivates us
00:03:59.120 to do what we do says a lot about our
00:04:01.680 hearts. The Savior warned that while
00:04:04.799 many are called by him, few are chosen
00:04:07.519 because their hearts are set so much
00:04:09.360 upon the things of this world and they
00:04:11.680 aspire to the honors of men. Do I make
00:04:15.120 the Savior a priority in my life? Is my
00:04:18.880 eyes single to his glory in all that I
00:04:21.600 do?
00:04:23.120 Second, our willingness to obey God's
00:04:25.520 commandments. Throughout scripture, the
00:04:28.320 Lord and his prophets have associated
00:04:30.320 pride and disobedience with having a
00:04:32.400 hardened heart. Nephi exhorted his
00:04:35.759 brother, saying, "How is it that you do
00:04:37.919 not keep the commandments of the Lord?
00:04:40.400 How is it that you will perish because
00:04:42.320 of the hardness of your hearts?" To the
00:04:44.880 saints in Missouri, the Lord warned,
00:04:46.880 "But he that doeth not anything until he
00:04:49.520 is commanded and receiveth a commandment
00:04:51.919 with a doubtful heart and keep it with
00:04:54.320 lawfulness, the same is damned." While
00:04:57.120 the Savior does not expect perfection in
00:04:59.440 keeping his commandments, he does ask
00:05:01.759 that we desire and strive to keep them
00:05:04.160 with all our hearts.
00:05:06.320 Third, our diligence in studying the
00:05:08.720 scriptures and seeking revelation. The
00:05:11.280 Lord admonished all over Calvary to
00:05:13.280 treasure up these words in thy heart.
00:05:15.759 We're invited to search the scriptures
00:05:17.840 diligently and through the power of the
00:05:19.840 Holy Ghost, seek to obtain understanding
00:05:22.560 and a witness of the truthfulness of the
00:05:25.039 gospel in our hearts. The prophet
00:05:27.520 Abinadai rebuked the priests of the
00:05:29.440 wicked King Noah for not doing that,
00:05:31.520 saying, "You have not applied your
00:05:33.520 hearts to understanding. Therefore, you
00:05:36.000 have not been wise.
00:05:38.160 Am I making a sincere effort to study
00:05:40.560 the scriptures daily and to apply my
00:05:43.039 heart to understand them through prayer?
00:05:46.240 Fourth, our thoughts and words. The
00:05:49.680 Savior thought that out of the heart
00:05:51.600 proceeded evil thoughts and that out of
00:05:53.520 the abundance of the heart, the mouth
00:05:55.360 speaketh. The quality of our thoughts
00:05:58.000 and words is a good indicator of the
00:06:00.160 purity of our hearts. Am I fostering too
00:06:03.280 many negative thoughts about others
00:06:04.880 actions or motives or even about myself?
00:06:08.080 Am I too quick to judge and condemn
00:06:10.240 others? Do I seek to find excuses or
00:06:13.600 justification for my mistakes? And what
00:06:16.479 about my words? Do they lift and inspire
00:06:19.520 those around me, or do they often create
00:06:21.919 conflict and resentment?
00:06:24.160 After my physical tests were completed,
00:06:26.160 my doctor told me that overall my heart
00:06:29.039 was healthy, but there were a few
00:06:30.880 concerns that needed to be addressed now
00:06:33.039 before they became serious. He then
00:06:35.600 prescribed some lifestyle changes.
00:06:38.400 Likewise, as you performed the spiritual
00:06:40.560 assessment of your heart and notice some
00:06:42.639 negative symptoms starting to creep in,
00:06:45.280 please don't panic. The Savior has
00:06:48.080 provided excellent spiritual medication
00:06:50.319 and treatment to help you. He has even
00:06:53.120 promised to give you a new heart. Here
00:06:56.000 are some actions that can improve your
00:06:57.919 heart's spiritual strength. First, your
00:07:01.199 relationship with Christ. As we dedicate
00:07:03.919 time daily to come closer to Christ, our
00:07:06.720 hearts are changed. Daily study of the
00:07:09.520 scriptures accompanied by sincere prayer
00:07:11.840 and regular fasting will increase your
00:07:14.479 love for the Savior and strengthen your
00:07:16.479 faith and desire to repent and humbly
00:07:19.280 yield your heart to God. Consider this
00:07:22.080 example from Nephi. Wherefore I did cry
00:07:25.280 unto the Lord, and behold, he did visit
00:07:27.680 me, and did soften my heart, that I did
00:07:30.560 believe all the words which had been
00:07:32.160 spoken by my father. As we continue to
00:07:35.440 nourish the seed of faith by our
00:07:37.039 righteous desires and actions, we will
00:07:39.599 experience the same sanctification of
00:07:41.840 our hearts as the Nephites. They did
00:07:44.400 fast and pray often and did wax stronger
00:07:46.800 and stronger in their humility and
00:07:48.800 firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ
00:07:51.440 unto the filling their souls with joy
00:07:53.599 and consolation. Yay, even to the
00:07:56.400 purifying and the sanctification of
00:07:58.479 their hearts, which sanctification
00:08:00.720 cometh because of their yielding their
00:08:02.479 hearts unto God.
00:08:04.800 Second, align your will with his. The
00:08:07.520 Savior taught, "If you love me, keep my
00:08:10.240 commandments." He invites us to
00:08:12.400 demonstrate our love by making and
00:08:13.919 keeping covenants with him. As we strive
00:08:16.319 daily to keep his commandments,
00:08:17.919 sincerely repent from our sins and
00:08:20.160 persevere in taking his name upon us and
00:08:22.319 aligning our will with his will, we can
00:08:24.720 be blessed with the constant
00:08:26.000 companionship of the Holy Ghost. Nephi
00:08:28.800 testified, I know that if you shall
00:08:30.960 follow the Son with full purpose of
00:08:32.640 heart, acting no hypocrisy and no
00:08:34.719 deception before God, but with real
00:08:36.719 intent, repenting of your sins,
00:08:39.279 witnessing unto the Father that you are
00:08:41.120 willing to take upon you the name of
00:08:42.640 Christ by baptism, then you shall
00:08:44.959 receive the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost
00:08:47.519 will guide you and help you know the
00:08:49.200 will of the Lord and make good choices.
00:08:51.839 Last, serve God and others with all your
00:08:54.000 heart. The Savior invites all to serve
00:08:56.560 him with all your heart. When we choose
00:08:59.040 to do each thing the Lord has asked us
00:09:00.720 to do, such as keeping the commandments,
00:09:03.120 partaking of the sacrament, worshiping
00:09:05.279 in the temple, and serving others with a
00:09:07.680 sincere heart and with real intent, each
00:09:10.240 act of service and worship becomes a
00:09:12.320 powerful spiritual experience that
00:09:14.480 strengthens our faith and testimony and
00:09:17.040 fill our hearts with joy and love for
00:09:18.880 God and our fellow men. The prophet
00:09:21.200 Alma's question still echoes today. Have
00:09:24.000 you spiritually been born of God? Have
00:09:26.640 you received his image in your
00:09:28.080 countenances? Have you experienced this
00:09:30.720 mighty change in your hearts? Brothers
00:09:33.760 and sisters, I invite you to give your
00:09:36.240 whole heart to the Savior today. Let
00:09:39.040 each act of worship and service be
00:09:41.279 sincere and intentional. Set aside the
00:09:44.240 distractions of the world and strive to
00:09:46.640 have meaningful time for the Lord every
00:09:48.640 day of your lives. Repent and return to
00:09:51.760 him with all your heart, and he will
00:09:54.240 forgive you and encircle you in the arms
00:09:56.240 of his love. Seek not the things of this
00:09:59.120 world, but choose to have your eyes
00:10:00.880 single to his glory, and seek the things
00:10:03.120 of a better one. He knows your thoughts
00:10:05.519 and the desires of your heart. And as
00:10:07.600 you come unto him, he will bless you
00:10:09.600 with strength, confidence, peace, and a
00:10:12.720 joy and joy in this life and a place in
00:10:15.200 his celestial kingdom for all eternity.
00:10:17.680 I know Jesus Christ lives. He is our
00:10:20.399 redeemer and he loves you and I with all
00:10:23.600 his heart. In the name of Jesus Christ.
00:10:26.320 Amen.
00:10:27.279 Amen.
