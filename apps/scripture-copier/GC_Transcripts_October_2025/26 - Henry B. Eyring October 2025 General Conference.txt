00:00:01.920 My dear brothers and sisters,
00:00:05.359 I feel the love of the Lord as we meet
00:00:08.800 together.
00:00:10.800 I am humbled to speak with you.
00:00:15.120 I pray that the spirit will carry into
00:00:18.080 your hearts what the Lord would have you
00:00:20.800 hear far beyond the words which I will
00:00:24.640 speak.
00:00:26.640 Long ago, I sought to learn physics and
00:00:30.640 mathematics in my college years.
00:00:35.440 I felt overwhelmed.
00:00:38.239 I began to feel that I was trying to
00:00:40.640 learn something that was beyond me.
00:00:44.640 The more I felt overwhelmed, the less I
00:00:47.600 felt the strength to keep trying.
00:00:51.120 My discouragement
00:00:53.199 led me to feel that my efforts were
00:00:55.840 almost fruitless.
00:00:58.559 I began to think of quitting, of doing
00:01:02.160 something easier.
00:01:04.959 I felt weak.
00:01:07.920 As I prayed,
00:01:10.080 I felt the quiet assurance of the Lord.
00:01:15.040 I felt him say to my mind,
00:01:19.360 "I'm proving you,
00:01:22.159 but I am also with you."
00:01:26.400 I did not know then all that those words
00:01:29.920 meant,
00:01:31.520 but I knew what to do. I went to work.
00:01:36.159 By pondering and working during the
00:01:39.200 years that followed, I came to
00:01:41.920 understand
00:01:43.840 this message of encouragement in the
00:01:47.360 scriptures.
00:01:50.000 I can do all things through Christ
00:01:54.560 which strengthenth me.
00:01:59.040 I learned that my struggle with physics
00:02:02.960 was actually a a gift from the Lord.
00:02:07.040 He was teaching me that with his help,
00:02:12.160 I could do things that seemed impossible
00:02:16.879 if I had the faith that he would be
00:02:19.920 there to help me.
00:02:23.599 Through this gift, the Lord was working
00:02:27.920 to prove and strengthen me.
00:02:32.480 The word prove has several meanings. To
00:02:36.000 prove something is not simply to test
00:02:39.040 it. It is to increase its strength.
00:02:44.239 To prove a piece of steel is to place it
00:02:48.000 under strain, heat, weight, and pressure
00:02:52.239 are added until its true nature is
00:02:57.599 enhanced and revealed.
00:03:01.040 The steel is not weakened by the
00:03:04.159 proving.
00:03:06.159 In fact, it becomes something that can
00:03:09.440 be trusted, something strong enough to
00:03:13.599 bear greater burdens.
00:03:16.959 The Lord proves us in much the same way
00:03:21.840 to strengthen us.
00:03:24.800 That proving does not come in moments of
00:03:28.239 ease or comfort.
00:03:31.120 It comes in moments when we feel
00:03:33.840 stretched beyond what we thought we
00:03:36.480 could bear.
00:03:38.239 The Lord teaches that we are to continue
00:03:40.720 to grow and never tire in our in our
00:03:44.239 efforts. That we never give up. That we
00:03:48.000 keep trying.
00:03:51.599 When we continue to have faith in Jesus
00:03:54.159 Christ, even when things might feel
00:03:57.360 impossible for us at the moment, we
00:04:01.280 become spiritually stronger.
00:04:05.439 The sacred scriptural records
00:04:08.799 emphasize this truth.
00:04:11.840 The prophet Moroni, for instance, was
00:04:15.120 proved and strengthened in such a way.
00:04:19.519 He lived his final years alone.
00:04:23.199 He wrote that he had no friends, that
00:04:25.360 his father had been killed, that his
00:04:28.080 people had been destroyed.
00:04:31.280 He was hunted by those who sought his
00:04:33.759 life.
00:04:35.360 Yet Moroni did not despair.
00:04:39.120 Instead, he engraved his testimony of
00:04:42.639 Jesus Christ on plates for people he
00:04:46.240 would not live to see, including the
00:04:49.600 descendants of the people who desired to
00:04:52.479 kill him. He wrote for us. He knew that
00:04:57.120 some would mock his words. He knew that
00:04:59.840 some would reject them. Yet, he kept
00:05:02.800 writing.
00:05:05.040 In his proving, Merlin's faith was
00:05:08.800 refined and strengthened.
00:05:12.000 It became more pure.
00:05:14.639 His words carry the power of one who
00:05:17.600 endured faithfully to the end.
00:05:21.680 We can feel that power as we read his
00:05:25.440 testimony.
00:05:27.919 Now I Moroni wrote
00:05:31.360 write somewhat as seemth me good. And I
00:05:33.759 write unto my brethren the Lammonites.
00:05:37.039 And I would that they should know that
00:05:39.360 more than 420 years have passed away
00:05:43.919 since the sign was given of the coming
00:05:47.280 of Christ.
00:05:49.600 and I seal up these records after I have
00:05:52.960 spoken a few words by way of exhortation
00:05:57.039 unto you. Behold, I would exhort you
00:06:00.800 that when you shall read these things,
00:06:03.440 if it be wisdom in God, that you should
00:06:05.840 read them, that ye would remember how
00:06:09.360 merciful the Lord hath been unto the
00:06:12.319 children of men from the creation of
00:06:15.440 Adam, even down until the time that she
00:06:19.600 shall receive these things, and ponder
00:06:22.400 it in your hearts.
00:06:24.560 And when ye shall receive these things,
00:06:26.960 I would exhort you that you would ask
00:06:29.840 God the eternal father in the name of
00:06:33.360 Christ if these things are not true. And
00:06:37.280 if he shall ask with his sincere heart,
00:06:40.800 with real intent, having faith in
00:06:43.600 Christ, he will manifest the truth of it
00:06:46.880 unto you by the power of the Holy Ghost.
00:06:51.680 and by the power of the Holy Ghost, ye
00:06:55.199 may know the truth of all things.
00:06:59.520 Moroni's testimony was refined
00:07:03.759 in loneliness, but it shines with light
00:07:08.080 to guide all generations to seek our
00:07:10.880 father in heaven and the Savior Jesus
00:07:14.319 Christ. Another Book of Mormon prophet
00:07:18.160 Jacob was proved and strengthened as a
00:07:23.120 child who experienced afflictions and
00:07:26.880 much sorrow.
00:07:28.800 But his father Lehi
00:07:31.440 taught him God would bless him through
00:07:34.400 his trials.
00:07:37.280 And behold, in thy childhood thou hast
00:07:39.599 suffered afflictions and much sorrow
00:07:43.120 because of the rudeness of thy brethren.
00:07:45.840 Nevertheless, Jacob, my firstborn in the
00:07:49.520 wilderness, thou knowest the greatness
00:07:51.919 of God, and he shall consecrate thine
00:07:56.240 afflictions for thy gain.
00:08:00.160 Wherefore thy soul shall be blessed, and
00:08:02.879 thou shalt dwell safely with thy brother
00:08:05.360 Nephi, and thy days shall be spent in
00:08:08.479 the service of thy God. Wherefore I know
00:08:11.919 that thou art redeemed, because of the
00:08:14.960 righteousness of thy redeemer. For thou
00:08:18.319 hast beheld that in the fullness of time
00:08:21.680 he cometh to bring salvation unto men.
00:08:27.120 The prophet Joseph Smith experienced
00:08:30.400 such proving and strengthening when he
00:08:33.839 was in Liberty jail. In the depths of
00:08:37.039 anguish, the prophet Joseph cried out,
00:08:40.799 "Oh God, where art thou? How long shall
00:08:44.480 thy hand be stayed?"
00:08:47.200 The Lord saw in Joseph's suffering the
00:08:51.360 sanctifying effect of his enduring it
00:08:54.240 well when he replied, "My son, be peace
00:08:58.640 unto thy soul. Thine adversity and thine
00:09:02.000 afflictions shall be but a small moment,
00:09:05.839 and then if thou endure it well, God
00:09:09.600 shall exalt thee on high. Thou shalt
00:09:13.680 triumph over all thy foes.
00:09:19.360 The greatest example of proving and
00:09:21.519 strengthening occurred through the
00:09:23.760 Savior's atonement. He took upon him the
00:09:26.959 sins of the world. He bore our pains and
00:09:30.320 our sorrows. He drank the bitter cup. He
00:09:34.480 proved faithful in every moment.
00:09:37.760 Because of his glorious atonement, Jesus
00:09:41.440 Christ can strengthen us in our times of
00:09:44.800 trial. He knows how to sucker us because
00:09:48.560 he has felt all the challenges that we
00:09:51.680 will ever feel in mortality.
00:09:55.040 He will take upon him the pains and the
00:09:57.279 sicknesses of his people that he may
00:09:59.760 know according to the flesh how to
00:10:02.560 sucker his people according to their
00:10:05.920 infirmities.
00:10:09.040 We learn that while in the garden of
00:10:11.519 Gethsemane, the savior did ask the
00:10:14.959 father if the trial could pass over him.
00:10:18.480 And then he also said if it was the
00:10:21.519 father's will, then the savior would do
00:10:24.320 it. In other words, the savior even took
00:10:28.079 on doubt and uncertainty, but he had
00:10:31.360 faith in his heavenly father.
00:10:34.959 Brothers and sisters, your proving and
00:10:38.160 strengthening may not look like Moroni's
00:10:41.600 or Jacob's or the prophet Joseph's,
00:10:45.519 but it will come.
00:10:47.760 It may come quietly through the trials
00:10:51.279 of family life.
00:10:53.600 It may come through illness or
00:10:56.560 disappointment
00:10:58.160 or grief or loneliness.
00:11:01.920 I bear witness that these moments are
00:11:05.200 not evident evidence that the Lord has
00:11:08.720 abandoned you. Rather, they are evidence
00:11:11.680 that he loves you enough to refine and
00:11:16.079 strengthen you.
00:11:18.720 He is making you strong enough to carry
00:11:22.320 the weight of eternal life.
00:11:25.839 If we remain faithful in our service,
00:11:30.000 the Lord will refine us. He will
00:11:33.920 strengthen us. And one day we will look
00:11:38.240 back and see that those very trials were
00:11:43.680 evidence of his love.
00:11:47.120 We will see that he was shaping us to be
00:11:51.040 able to stand with him in glory.
00:11:56.640 As the Lord's Apostle Paul stated at the
00:12:00.480 end of his own life, "I have fought a
00:12:03.839 good fight. I have finished my course.
00:12:08.800 I have kept the faith.
00:12:11.920 I testify that God knows you.
00:12:16.079 He knows the trials you face. He is with
00:12:20.000 you.
00:12:21.600 He will not forsake you.
00:12:25.360 I testify that Jesus Christ is the son
00:12:30.000 of God. He is our strength, our
00:12:34.000 redeemer, our hope.
00:12:37.440 If we trust him, he will make our
00:12:40.880 spiritual power equal to every trial we
00:12:46.320 are called to bear.
00:12:49.839 I so testify
00:12:52.079 in the sacred name of Jesus Christ.
00:12:55.680 Amen.
00:12:56.639 Amen.
