00:00:00.960 Last June, a terrible accident occurred
00:00:04.160 in the country of Lysoto in southern
00:00:06.560 Africa.
00:00:08.320 A small bus carrying 20 young women of
00:00:11.120 the Maput Soy branch of the church and
00:00:14.559 seven of their leaders was headed to the
00:00:16.800 capital city Maseru for a gathering of
00:00:20.000 young women from their district.
00:00:22.960 As they traveled the two-lane highway in
00:00:25.119 the morning hours, a car coming in the
00:00:27.599 opposite direction attempting to pass
00:00:30.240 another vehicle came into the lane
00:00:33.040 occupied by the bus. There was no space
00:00:36.399 or time to avoid a head-on collision,
00:00:39.920 and within seconds, the vehicles hit,
00:00:43.040 rolled off the road, and burst into
00:00:45.280 flames.
00:00:47.200 In all, 15 people died in the accident,
00:00:50.960 including six young women, two young
00:00:53.760 women leaders, and the branch president
00:00:56.559 and his wife.
00:00:58.719 Survivors, family members, and friends
00:01:01.039 have expressed a range of emotions,
00:01:03.359 including moments of anger and
00:01:05.519 depression, even guilt.
00:01:08.159 Despite these feelings and unanswered
00:01:10.479 questions, they have comforted one
00:01:12.240 another and turned to God through sacred
00:01:15.760 music, the scriptures, and prayer where
00:01:19.439 they have found solace.
00:01:22.479 17-year-old survivor Setsuana Celibelli
00:01:26.000 testified,
00:01:27.520 "Jesus Christ loves us and is with us
00:01:31.280 even though our hearts hurt."
00:01:35.040 A young woman and a leader who were
00:01:37.040 hospitalized for burn treatments studied
00:01:39.439 the Book of Mormon together.
00:01:41.680 One said, "Lately, we've been reading in
00:01:44.240 Moroni." And Moroni says exactly what
00:01:46.960 I've been feeling. When he speaks, it's
00:01:50.000 like he's saying, "You have to learn
00:01:52.159 these words because they are written for
00:01:54.479 you to help you pass through this."
00:01:58.640 At a joint funeral service for those who
00:02:00.960 perished, Area 70 Elder Sabongam Keezy
00:02:04.960 council, "We should all turn to the Lord
00:02:08.000 at this time and ask him to comfort our
00:02:10.639 hearts and to soothe the pain we feel."
00:02:15.520 The young woman president from the
00:02:17.520 neighboring Leivbe branch, Mu Makura,
00:02:20.560 urged, "Turn to the Lord and find
00:02:24.160 strength to accept his will. Jesus
00:02:27.200 Christ is the author and finisher of our
00:02:29.680 faith. Don't look away, but look to him.
00:02:34.879 Look to him. Her words echo the council
00:02:38.319 of Alma to his son Helaleman. See that
00:02:41.280 you look to God and live. Elma cited the
00:02:44.879 experience of Lehi and his people with
00:02:46.800 the Leona as a type. It is as easy to
00:02:50.560 give heed to the word of Christ, which
00:02:52.560 will point to you a straight course to
00:02:55.200 eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers
00:02:58.160 to give heed to this compass, which
00:03:00.560 would point unto them a straight course
00:03:02.800 to the promised land.
00:03:05.280 Elma said, "If they would look, they
00:03:08.239 might live, and if we look, we may live
00:03:11.519 forever."
00:03:13.280 On another occasion, Elma cited the
00:03:15.440 example of the brass serpent raised by
00:03:17.440 Moses when the ancient Israelites were
00:03:20.000 afflicted by fiery serpents.
00:03:22.800 The Lord told Moses to make a figure of
00:03:25.040 a serpent and lift it on a pole with the
00:03:28.080 promise that everyone that is bitten
00:03:30.159 when he lookth upon it shall live.
00:03:34.480 Elma explained that the brass figure was
00:03:36.400 a type or symbol of Christ who would be
00:03:39.280 lifted up upon the cross. Many did look
00:03:42.560 and live, but others were, in Elma's
00:03:45.280 words, so hardened that they simply
00:03:47.840 would not look and perished.
00:03:50.640 Elma asked, "If you could be healed by
00:03:53.360 merely casting about your eyes that she
00:03:55.519 might be healed, would you not behold
00:03:57.840 quickly? Or would you rather harden your
00:04:00.560 hearts in unbelief and be slothful that
00:04:03.280 you would not cast about your eyes that
00:04:05.280 you might perish?
00:04:07.439 Then cast about your eyes and begin to
00:04:09.519 believe in the Son of God that he will
00:04:12.640 come to redeem his people and that he
00:04:14.720 shall suffer and die to atone for their
00:04:17.680 sins. and that he shall rise again from
00:04:20.320 the dead, which shall bring to pass the
00:04:22.639 resurrection, that all men shall stand
00:04:25.440 before him to be judged at the last and
00:04:28.240 judgment day according to their works.
00:04:32.560 Of course, the council look to God and
00:04:34.320 live has meaning for us not only in
00:04:36.800 eternity but also makes all the
00:04:39.440 difference in the character and quality
00:04:41.840 of our mortal lives. Remember the words
00:04:44.960 of young sister Celibelli in lutu
00:04:47.360 already mentioned. Jesus Christ loves us
00:04:50.560 and is with us even though our hearts
00:04:53.440 hurt.
00:04:55.520 It is in the nature of a fallen world
00:04:57.600 where the devil rages and where everyone
00:04:59.919 is imperfect that there will be
00:05:02.320 disappointments and offenses, suffering
00:05:05.120 and sorrow, failure and loss,
00:05:08.720 persecution and injustice.
00:05:12.160 It is only by looking to God that
00:05:14.160 individuals and families, even nations
00:05:16.960 can flourish.
00:05:18.960 President Russell M. Nelson taught,
00:05:21.759 "Because the Savior through his infinite
00:05:24.240 atonement redeemed each of us from
00:05:26.400 weakness, mistakes, and sin, and because
00:05:29.759 he experienced every pain, worry, and
00:05:32.320 burden you have ever had. Then, as you
00:05:35.280 truly repent and seek his help, you can
00:05:38.160 rise above this present, precarious
00:05:40.720 world.
00:05:43.440 No promise is repeated more often in the
00:05:45.919 Book of Mormon scripture than this.
00:05:48.960 In as much as ye shall keep my
00:05:50.880 commandments, ye shall prosper in the
00:05:53.280 land. But in as much as you will not
00:05:56.240 keep my commandments, ye shall be cut
00:05:58.400 off from my presence.
00:06:01.039 The lived experience of the Book of
00:06:02.960 Mormon peoples over centuries
00:06:05.360 demonstrates the truth of these words.
00:06:08.800 Prosper meant enjoying the guidance and
00:06:10.960 blessing of heaven in their lives.
00:06:13.919 Prosper meant achieving levels of
00:06:15.919 economic well-being that enable them to
00:06:18.960 marry, raise families, have the
00:06:21.120 necessities of life, sometimes in
00:06:23.600 abundance,
00:06:25.120 and to minister to the needs of others.
00:06:28.160 Prospering included the capacity to rise
00:06:30.639 above hardship and trial.
00:06:33.440 Through the grace of Christ, all things
00:06:35.600 worked together for their good, refined
00:06:38.479 them, and deepened their relationship
00:06:40.880 with him. Alma explained that looking to
00:06:44.160 God is to keep his commandments. Cry
00:06:47.039 unto him continually for his support.
00:06:50.639 Counsel with him in all your doings, and
00:06:53.680 let your heart be full of thanks unto
00:06:55.520 him day and night.
00:06:58.639 God's commandments and counsel are found
00:07:00.639 in the scriptures and the words of his
00:07:02.880 servants.
00:07:04.479 The principles and ideals laid out in
00:07:07.199 the family, a proclamation to the world,
00:07:09.360 are a prime example.
00:07:11.919 Another is the guidance found in the
00:07:13.680 booklet for the strength of youth. The
00:07:16.639 young men and young women theme for this
00:07:18.639 year is look unto Christ. Drawn from the
00:07:21.919 Lord's comforting direction to Joseph
00:07:23.840 Smith and Oliver Calry. Look unto me in
00:07:26.720 every thought. Doubt not. Fear not.
00:07:30.319 For the strength of youth speaks to
00:07:32.000 several of God's most urgent
00:07:34.240 commandments and standards and teaches
00:07:37.120 how to look to the Lord in making good
00:07:39.440 decisions. It's a guide not only for
00:07:42.160 youth but for all of us. As one very
00:07:45.520 important example for the strength of
00:07:48.160 youth has crucial guidance in the
00:07:49.919 chapter titled your body is sacred. It
00:07:53.759 instructs, "Treat your body and others
00:07:56.160 bodies with respect as you make
00:07:59.120 decisions about your clothing,
00:08:01.599 hairstyle, and appearance. Ask yourself,
00:08:05.599 am I honoring my body as a sacred gift
00:08:08.560 from God?"
00:08:10.479 For the strength of youth further
00:08:12.080 states, "Keep sex and sexual feelings
00:08:15.360 sacred. They should not be the subject
00:08:17.840 of jokes or entertainment.
00:08:20.240 Outside of marriage between a man and a
00:08:22.160 woman, it is wrong to touch the private
00:08:24.160 sacred parts of another's body, even if
00:08:26.560 clothed.
00:08:28.240 In your choices about what you do, look
00:08:30.879 at, read, listen to, think, post, or
00:08:34.880 text, avoid anything that purposely
00:08:38.559 arouses lustful emotions in others or
00:08:41.760 yourself.
00:08:43.519 This calls to mind President Nelson's
00:08:46.080 recent admonition. quote, "Few things
00:08:49.920 will complicate your life more quickly
00:08:52.959 than violating this divine law of
00:08:54.959 chastity.
00:08:56.480 For those who have made covenants with
00:08:58.160 God, immorality is one of the quickest
00:09:00.480 ways to lose your testimony."
00:09:03.680 The power to create life is the one
00:09:06.320 privilege of godhood that Heavenly
00:09:09.200 Father allows his mortal children to
00:09:11.279 exercise.
00:09:12.959 Thus, God set clear guidelines for the
00:09:15.360 use of this living divine power.
00:09:18.640 Physical intimacy is only for a man and
00:09:21.120 a woman who are married to each other.
00:09:24.000 Continuing
00:09:25.839 President Nelson's comment, much of the
00:09:29.200 world does not believe this. But public
00:09:32.480 opinion is not the arbiter of truth. The
00:09:35.600 Lord has declared that no unchased
00:09:37.600 person will attain the celestial
00:09:39.200 kingdom. If you've been unchanged, I
00:09:41.839 plead with you to repent. Come unto
00:09:44.320 Christ and receive his promise of
00:09:46.320 complete forgiveness as you fully repent
00:09:49.600 of your sins." End quote.
00:09:53.440 Remember that in the Book of Mormon
00:09:55.200 promise, the opposite of prosperity was
00:09:57.760 not poverty. It was being cut off from
00:10:00.800 the presence of the Lord. His presence
00:10:03.839 refers to the influence of his spirit in
00:10:06.720 one's life.
00:10:08.320 All are imbued with the light of Christ
00:10:10.240 as they come into the world. In
00:10:12.560 addition, some act to be baptized and
00:10:15.200 receive the gift and added light of the
00:10:17.440 Holy Ghost. He brings inspiration and
00:10:20.560 guidance, enhances and refineses one's
00:10:23.839 native gifts and abilities and helps to
00:10:26.720 avoid evil influences, poor decisions,
00:10:30.000 and dead ends.
00:10:32.399 Like you, I know some who once enjoyed
00:10:34.480 the gift of the Holy Ghost, but who
00:10:36.320 through failure to keep the commandments
00:10:37.920 of God have lost that blessing.
00:10:40.640 One in particular comes to mind whose
00:10:42.640 membership in the church had been
00:10:44.079 withdrawn due to transgression.
00:10:46.800 He said that his initial reaction was to
00:10:48.640 feel offended. He felt judged by
00:10:51.360 imperfect leaders. He knew his conduct
00:10:54.160 had been wrong, but he rationalized it
00:10:56.079 by pointing to the faults and failings
00:10:58.160 of others.
00:10:59.680 After a while, he began to feel
00:11:01.440 comfortable in a lifestyle outside the
00:11:03.600 church without the obligation of
00:11:05.920 callings, expectations of attending
00:11:08.320 worship services and ministering to
00:11:10.240 others. This continued for some time,
00:11:13.120 but he began to feel ever more keenly
00:11:16.320 the absence of the Holy Spirit, God's
00:11:18.800 presence in his life. By experience, he
00:11:22.399 knew what it was like to have day by day
00:11:24.959 the comfort, guidance, and confidence
00:11:28.000 born of the spirit, and he missed it.
00:11:31.040 Finally, he did what was needed to
00:11:32.720 repent and qualify once more for baptism
00:11:35.440 of water and of the spirit.
00:11:39.519 There seems to be no end to the
00:11:41.360 different sources people look to for
00:11:43.920 meaning, happiness, and health.
00:11:46.880 Most are looking beyond the mark.
00:11:50.000 But we need not be children tossed to
00:11:52.399 and fro and carried about by every wind
00:11:54.560 of doctrine or fashion.
00:11:57.440 In looking to God, we can find peace in
00:11:59.839 difficulty.
00:12:01.440 And our faith can continue to grow even
00:12:03.920 in times of doubt and spiritual
00:12:06.000 challenge.
00:12:07.519 We can receive strength in the face of
00:12:10.079 opposition and isolation.
00:12:12.800 We can reconcile the ideal with the
00:12:16.079 present reality.
00:12:18.480 Truly, there is no other way than what
00:12:21.680 God himself has ordained.
00:12:24.399 Look unto me and be ye saved, all the
00:12:27.680 ends of the earth. For I am God and
00:12:31.680 there is none else.
00:12:34.560 Looking to God means that he's not just
00:12:36.639 one of our priorities.
00:12:39.440 It means rather that he is our one
00:12:41.120 highest priority.
00:12:43.519 I call to mind again that awful crash in
00:12:45.920 Lutu last June.
00:12:48.160 from her hospital bed. One of the young
00:12:50.240 women leaders who survived, who did not
00:12:53.279 believe in God before joining the
00:12:55.040 church, said that her purpose is now to
00:12:58.320 discover why her life was spared.
00:13:01.760 Constantly serving God is how I will
00:13:03.920 come to an answer if I come to an
00:13:05.920 answer. She stated, I used to think that
00:13:08.800 I love God, but now I really, really,
00:13:13.440 really, really love him.
00:13:16.720 Now he is the number one priority in my
00:13:19.360 life.
00:13:21.600 I bear testimony of the father, son and
00:13:24.480 holy ghost who in perfect unity of word,
00:13:28.720 thought, purpose and action are the one
00:13:32.000 God to whom we may look for all good
00:13:34.639 things.
00:13:36.320 I bear testimony of the atonement of
00:13:38.399 Jesus Christ. Whence comes the power to
00:13:42.320 fulfill this wonderful promise. Look
00:13:45.600 unto me and endure to the end and ye
00:13:48.399 shall live. For him unto him that
00:13:52.000 endureth to the end will I give eternal
00:13:54.880 life. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
00:13:59.199 Amen.
