00:00:00.880 Several years ago, our daughter had a
00:00:03.200 profound experience on her mission. With
00:00:06.000 her approval, I share an excerpt of what
00:00:08.480 she wrote to us that week. Yesterday, a
00:00:11.679 returning member asked us to come over
00:00:13.599 as soon as possible. When we arrived, we
00:00:16.400 found her on the floor sobbing
00:00:18.240 uncontrollably.
00:00:19.920 Through the tears, we found out that she
00:00:21.600 had lost her job, was going to be
00:00:23.600 evicted from her apartment, and once
00:00:26.080 again become homeless. Our daughter
00:00:29.439 continued, "I started frantically
00:00:31.599 searching my scriptures, trying to find
00:00:34.079 something, anything to help her. As I
00:00:37.840 was looking for the perfect verse, I
00:00:40.800 thought, what am I doing? This is not
00:00:43.760 what Christ would do. This is not a
00:00:46.640 problem that I can solve, but this is a
00:00:50.239 literal daughter of God that needs my
00:00:52.960 help."
00:00:54.399 So I closed my scriptures, knelt beside
00:00:57.360 her, and held her while we cried
00:01:00.160 together until she was ready to stand up
00:01:04.080 and face this trial.
00:01:06.560 After this woman was comforted, our
00:01:08.479 daughter then used the scriptures to try
00:01:10.560 and help her understand the reality of
00:01:13.200 her divine worth and to teach her one of
00:01:15.840 the most fundamental truths of our
00:01:17.680 existence, that we are beloved sons and
00:01:21.840 daughters of God. A God that feels
00:01:24.479 perfect compassion for us when we suffer
00:01:27.600 and is ready to assist us as we stand
00:01:30.640 back up.
00:01:32.640 It is insightful that the first point of
00:01:34.560 doctrine that our missionaries teach is
00:01:36.799 that God is our loving heavenly father.
00:01:40.799 Every subsequent truth builds on the
00:01:43.759 foundational understanding of who we
00:01:46.880 really are. Susan H. Porter, primary
00:01:50.399 general president, taught, "When you
00:01:52.720 know and understand how completely you
00:01:54.799 are loved as a child of God, it changes
00:01:57.920 everything. It changes the way you feel
00:02:00.240 about yourself when you make mistakes.
00:02:02.719 It changes how you feel when difficult
00:02:04.640 things happen. It changes your view of
00:02:07.439 God's commandments. It changes your view
00:02:10.080 of others and of your capacity to make a
00:02:13.200 difference.
00:02:14.800 This change is illustrated as we read
00:02:16.879 about the experience Moses had when
00:02:19.440 talking with God face to face. During
00:02:22.319 that conversation, God repeatedly taught
00:02:25.200 Moses of his divine heritage.
00:02:28.720 saying, "Moses, thou art my son." God
00:02:33.120 explained that Moses was in the
00:02:34.640 similitude of his only begotten.
00:02:37.440 Moses came to understand clearly who he
00:02:40.319 was, that he had a work to do, and that
00:02:43.280 he had a loving heavenly father.
00:02:46.480 After this experience, the adversary
00:02:48.640 came tempting him and immediately
00:02:51.360 addressed him by saying, "Moses, son of
00:02:54.800 man." This is a common and dangerous
00:02:58.319 tool in the arsenal of the adversary.
00:03:01.519 While our heavenly father consistently
00:03:03.599 and lovingly reminds us that we are his
00:03:05.760 children, the adversary will always try
00:03:09.200 to label us by our weaknesses.
00:03:12.000 But Moses had already learned he was
00:03:14.080 more than a son of man. He declared to
00:03:17.040 Satan, "Who art thou? For behold, I am a
00:03:22.400 son of God."
00:03:24.720 Similarly, when we are confronted with
00:03:26.560 the challenges of mortality or when we
00:03:29.120 feel like anyone is trying to label us
00:03:31.599 by our weaknesses, we need to stand
00:03:34.159 strong in the knowledge of who we truly
00:03:36.959 are.
00:03:38.319 We must seek validation vertically, not
00:03:40.959 horizontally.
00:03:42.560 And as we do, we too can boldly
00:03:45.280 proclaim, "I am a child of God."
00:03:49.760 In a worldwide devotional for young
00:03:51.440 adults, our beloved President Russell M.
00:03:53.680 Nelson taught, "So, who are you? First
00:03:57.280 and foremost, you're a child of God, a
00:03:59.840 child of the covenant, and a disciple of
00:04:02.480 Jesus Christ. As you embrace these
00:04:05.200 truths, our heavenly father will help
00:04:07.200 you reach your ultimate goal of living
00:04:09.920 eternally in his holy presence.
00:04:13.840 It is no coincidence that in likely the
00:04:15.920 most repeated scripture, God reminds us
00:04:18.639 of our relationship with him. Of all the
00:04:21.918 names he could be identified by in the
00:04:23.919 sacrament prayer, he is asked to be
00:04:26.240 called
00:04:27.919 God,
00:04:29.680 the eternal father.
00:04:32.720 As we come to truly know who we are, we
00:04:35.600 will believe more strongly that our
00:04:37.120 loving heavenly father has provided a
00:04:38.960 plan for us to return to live with him
00:04:40.800 again. Elder Patrick Kieran taught, "Our
00:04:43.520 father's beautiful plan, even his
00:04:45.440 fabulous plan, is designed to bring you
00:04:48.080 home, not to keep you out. God is in
00:04:51.280 relentless pursuit of you." Think about
00:04:53.919 that for a moment. Our all powerful,
00:04:56.320 loving father is in relentless pursuit
00:04:59.360 of you. Regardless of where we are on
00:05:02.160 our path of disciplehip, our lives will
00:05:04.560 fundamentally change if we better
00:05:06.479 understand who we really are. May I
00:05:09.120 suggest two ways in which we can deepen
00:05:11.199 this understanding. First, prayer. As a
00:05:15.120 savior was beginning his mortal
00:05:16.479 ministry, he was led into the wilderness
00:05:18.800 to be with God. Perhaps we should shift
00:05:21.919 our mindset away from simply saying our
00:05:24.080 prayers to taking sufficient time to
00:05:26.800 really commune with and be with God each
00:05:30.240 day. I have found that the quality of my
00:05:33.120 prayers improve as I take a few minutes
00:05:35.360 to prepare to talk to my father. The
00:05:38.560 scriptures show us that this is a
00:05:40.000 pattern that works. Whether it is Joseph
00:05:42.479 Smith, Nephi the son of Helieman, or
00:05:45.120 Enus, all have some form of pondering
00:05:47.919 and reflecting prior to their recorded
00:05:50.800 communication with God. Enus said that
00:05:53.360 his soul hungered as the words of his
00:05:55.280 father sunk deep into his heart. Each of
00:05:58.400 these examples teaches us the need to
00:06:00.639 spiritually prepare for our time each
00:06:03.039 day to be with God. To the Nephites, the
00:06:06.319 Savior instructed, "When thou prayest,
00:06:08.319 enter into thy closet. And when thou has
00:06:10.560 shut thy door, pray to thy father."
00:06:13.919 Whether it is in a closet or in a
00:06:15.840 bedroom, the principle is to find a
00:06:18.720 place where you can be alone to pray, to
00:06:20.960 allow your soul to be still and to feel
00:06:24.479 the prompings of the still small voice.
00:06:27.120 We can prepare by pondering on the
00:06:29.039 things that we are grateful for and the
00:06:31.360 questions or concerns that we would like
00:06:33.280 to bring to our father.
00:06:35.280 We should strive not to have a rote
00:06:36.960 manner of prayer but to talk with our
00:06:39.919 father out loud if possible. Now I
00:06:43.680 realize that in the chaos of our lives
00:06:45.680 when we are wrestling with toddlers or
00:06:47.600 running between meetings, we may not
00:06:49.840 have the luxury of quiet closets and
00:06:52.560 thoughtful preparation.
00:06:54.720 But those silent, quick, and urgent
00:06:57.680 prayers can be much more meaningful when
00:07:00.560 we have made an effort to be with God
00:07:02.880 earlier in the day.
00:07:05.280 There may be some who haven't prayed for
00:07:07.039 a long time or others who haven't felt
00:07:09.840 like their prayers are being t heard. I
00:07:13.039 promise you that your heavenly father
00:07:15.199 knows you, loves you and wants to hear
00:07:18.639 from you. He wants to communicate with
00:07:21.520 you. He wants you to remember who you
00:07:25.520 are.
00:07:27.280 Elder Jeffrey R. Holland recently
00:07:28.960 taught, "However much you are praying,
00:07:31.680 pray more. However hard you are praying,
00:07:35.199 pray harder.
00:07:37.360 In addition to increasing the frequency
00:07:39.280 and ferveny of our prayers, studying the
00:07:41.759 Book of Mormon daily and worshiping in
00:07:43.599 the temple will help prepare our minds
00:07:46.319 for revelation.
00:07:48.160 As we strive to improve our
00:07:49.759 communication with our heavenly father,
00:07:52.000 he will bless us to feel more profoundly
00:07:54.720 that we are his children.
00:07:58.000 Second, come to know that Jesus is the
00:08:00.319 Christ. The greatest manifestation of
00:08:03.039 Heavenly Father's love for us as his
00:08:04.879 children is the reality that he sent his
00:08:08.479 son, our own personal savior, to help us
00:08:12.000 come home. Therefore, we need to come to
00:08:15.199 know him. Years ago, while serving as a
00:08:18.160 state president, I submitted a
00:08:19.759 recommendation for a brother to serve as
00:08:21.840 an ordinance worker in the temple. After
00:08:24.240 explaining what a wonderful ordinance
00:08:25.919 worker he would be, I inadvertently
00:08:28.560 pressed do not endorse, which submitted
00:08:31.520 the recommendation.
00:08:33.519 After unsuccessfully trying to recall
00:08:35.440 the message, I called the temple
00:08:37.039 president and said, "I have made a
00:08:40.000 horrible mistake."
00:08:42.799 Without hesitation, this good temple
00:08:44.640 president said, "President,
00:08:47.440 there is nothing that you have done that
00:08:50.560 can't be forgiven." and ultimately
00:08:53.600 corrected.
00:08:56.720 What a great truth
00:08:59.279 indeed. Jesus Christ is mighty to save.
00:09:04.320 In 2019, there was a profound change in
00:09:06.720 the temple recommend questions.
00:09:08.720 Previously, one question asked if you
00:09:10.320 had a testimony of Jesus Christ's role
00:09:12.320 as savior and redeemer. It now asks if
00:09:15.600 you have a testimony of his role as your
00:09:18.959 savior and redeemer. Jesus Christ's
00:09:22.080 atonement not only works for others, it
00:09:24.640 works for you and it works for me. He is
00:09:28.560 my savior. He is your savior
00:09:33.120 individually.
00:09:34.959 Only through him can you and I return to
00:09:38.240 be with our father. So brothers and
00:09:40.880 sisters, let us seek him. Let us study
00:09:43.760 his divine relationship with the father
00:09:45.839 and with each of us. Let us experience
00:09:48.560 the song of redeeming love that comes
00:09:50.640 personally to each one of us through our
00:09:53.680 redeemer. As we repent, as we come to
00:09:57.279 know him who is mighty to save, we will
00:10:00.240 come to understand that we as children
00:10:02.720 of God are his joy, his most important
00:10:06.320 focus, and are indeed each worth saving.
00:10:10.959 I testify that we have a loving heavenly
00:10:13.040 father. As we come to know this eternal
00:10:15.360 truth through mighty prayer, personal
00:10:17.839 revelation, and coming unto Jesus
00:10:19.760 Christ, we can now and always boldly
00:10:23.680 proclaim, I am a child of God. In the
00:10:28.720 name of Jesus Christ, amen.
