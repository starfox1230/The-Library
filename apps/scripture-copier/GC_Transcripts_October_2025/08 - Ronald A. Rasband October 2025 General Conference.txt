00:00:00.800 This general conference of October 2025
00:00:05.040 marks the 30th anniversary of the
00:00:07.600 announcement of the family. A
00:00:09.840 proclamation to the world by divine
00:00:13.120 design. This proclamation with its
00:00:15.839 revelatory words was created to maintain
00:00:19.760 and strengthen the family as the
00:00:22.160 fundamental unit of society.
00:00:25.920 Everyone belongs to a family. Whether
00:00:28.720 you are a mother, father, daughter, son,
00:00:31.519 grandchild, grandparent, aunt, uncle,
00:00:34.880 brother, sister, or cousin, most
00:00:38.800 importantly, each of us are, as the
00:00:41.520 proclamation states, a beloved spirit
00:00:44.960 son or daughter of heavenly parents with
00:00:48.399 a divine nature and destiny.
00:00:52.480 When I was called to the Holy Apostilhip
00:00:54.800 in 2015,
00:00:57.039 I was advised, "This proclamation is now
00:01:00.640 yours. Your name," pointing to the
00:01:04.080 words, "Council of the twel apostles in
00:01:07.200 the title is right here. Feel it and
00:01:11.200 teach it like you own it."
00:01:14.720 I love the family proclamation. I have
00:01:18.080 testified across the world from Africa
00:01:21.119 to Australia and everywhere in between
00:01:24.960 of the role of the family in God's
00:01:27.520 eternal plan. The proclamation has a
00:01:30.799 divine origin. So we must treat it with
00:01:33.920 the reverence deserving words from God.
00:01:38.000 Remember brothers and sisters, as I said
00:01:41.600 in a previous general conference from
00:01:43.680 this very pulpit, words matter.
00:01:47.520 Let me give you some background about
00:01:49.360 the proclamation as a core message of
00:01:52.799 what we believe.
00:01:55.119 In 1994,
00:01:57.119 a year before the proclamation was
00:01:59.280 presented, the quorum of the twel
00:02:01.520 apostles discussed how society and
00:02:05.119 governments were pulling away from God's
00:02:07.920 laws of family, marriage, and gender.
00:02:12.080 But that was not the end of what we saw.
00:02:14.959 President Russell M. Nelson later
00:02:17.120 explained, "We could see the efforts of
00:02:20.160 various communities to do away with all
00:02:23.599 standards and limitations on sexual
00:02:26.800 activity. We saw the confusion of
00:02:29.760 genders. We could see it all coming."
00:02:34.800 The 12 determined to prepare a document,
00:02:37.840 an official proclamation summaring the
00:02:40.879 church's position on family.
00:02:44.319 During that year, these apostles, Sears,
00:02:47.599 called of God, prepared a declaration
00:02:50.720 about the family. President Don H. Oaks
00:02:54.640 recalled, "They prayerfully turned to
00:02:57.120 the Lord for what they should say and
00:03:00.080 how they should say it." They presented
00:03:03.280 the first presidency, the proclamation.
00:03:06.959 Presidents Howard W. Hunter, Gordon B.
00:03:09.680 Hinckley, and Thomas S. Monson for their
00:03:12.959 consideration.
00:03:15.040 Just months later in March 1995,
00:03:19.120 President Hunter passed away and
00:03:21.599 President Hinckley became the 15th
00:03:24.239 president of the church.
00:03:27.120 The proclamation was now in his hands.
00:03:30.480 When would be the right time to make
00:03:32.319 this declaration to the church? That
00:03:36.000 time came six months later. Days before
00:03:39.760 the September 23rd General Women's
00:03:43.040 Meeting that preceded General
00:03:45.120 Conference, President Hinckley and his
00:03:47.680 counselors met in council with the
00:03:50.640 Relief Society General Presidency.
00:03:54.000 The sisters, like the apostles, had been
00:03:57.360 weighing concerns about women and
00:04:00.319 families.
00:04:01.840 They had focused the upcoming meeting on
00:04:05.120 families.
00:04:06.879 President Hinckley was scheduled to
00:04:08.720 address the women at the gathering. He
00:04:11.840 had been pondering the direction of his
00:04:14.400 remarks.
00:04:16.238 As the discussion progressed, he
00:04:18.959 referred by name to the newly created
00:04:21.839 but not yet public, the family, a
00:04:24.800 proclamation to the world. Was this
00:04:28.000 women's meeting the right setting to
00:04:30.320 make the decisive declaration about
00:04:33.680 family?
00:04:35.840 General Relief Society President Elaine
00:04:38.320 Jack later explained, "We didn't know
00:04:41.919 what the proclamation on the family was
00:04:44.639 at the time. We could tell by the title,
00:04:48.160 but we felt anything on the family would
00:04:50.880 be a positive thing."
00:04:52.960 It felt very positive that we had
00:04:55.360 members of the quorum of the 12 that
00:04:58.320 were receiving revelation.
00:05:01.840 The Relief Society meeting that Saturday
00:05:04.639 was historic. President Hinckley
00:05:07.520 introduced the family proclamation with
00:05:10.400 these important words.
00:05:13.919 with so much sophistry that is passed
00:05:16.320 off as truth. With so much of deception
00:05:19.759 concerning standards and values, with so
00:05:23.360 much of allurement and enticement to
00:05:26.160 take on the slow stain of the world, we
00:05:29.759 have felt to warn and forewarn of
00:05:32.800 standards, doctrines, and practices
00:05:36.639 relative to the family which the
00:05:38.960 prophets, seers, and revelators of this
00:05:42.320 church have repeatedly stated throughout
00:05:45.840 its history.
00:05:48.000 He then read the proclamation in its
00:05:50.479 entirety.
00:05:52.240 As the Lord has said, whether by mine
00:05:55.199 own voice or by the by the voice of my
00:05:58.400 servants, it is the same.
00:06:02.000 The proclamation states, "The family is
00:06:05.360 ordained of God."
00:06:08.080 I love the clarity of that statement.
00:06:11.759 The proclamation is a call for us to
00:06:14.160 live in mortality. Ever mindful of the
00:06:17.360 divinity within us and the eternal
00:06:20.880 future that lies before us. President
00:06:24.560 Nelson taught, "You are literally spirit
00:06:27.840 children of God. Make no mistake about
00:06:30.960 it. Your potential is divine. With your
00:06:35.120 diligent seeking, God will give you
00:06:37.759 glimpses of who you may become."
00:06:42.240 When presented, the proclamation did not
00:06:45.520 align with the views of many in the
00:06:49.280 world.
00:06:50.800 Not then,
00:06:52.639 not now.
00:06:54.560 There are those who take issue with the
00:06:56.639 declaration on family, marriage, and
00:06:59.599 gender.
00:07:01.120 Some suggest the church pull it back,
00:07:04.400 revise, or even set the proclamation
00:07:07.280 aside.
00:07:09.680 The proclamation on the family is, as
00:07:13.039 President Hinckley stated, doctrine. My
00:07:16.639 dear brothers and sisters, the
00:07:19.199 principles are not out of step, but
00:07:22.160 perfectly in step with the ways of the
00:07:25.120 Lord and his covenant path. The
00:07:28.560 teachings of the proclamation were
00:07:30.560 revealed by our Lord Jesus Christ to his
00:07:33.759 apostles then
00:07:36.560 and now.
00:07:38.800 This is his church. He has established
00:07:42.560 the truths by which we live.
00:07:46.639 Some of you may reflect on the
00:07:48.479 proclamation and say, "This isn't
00:07:51.280 working for me. It seems insensitive.
00:07:55.039 My family doesn't look like that. I
00:07:58.080 don't fit."
00:08:00.240 For those with concerns,
00:08:03.039 know that you are a child of heavenly
00:08:05.440 parents, part of your heavenly father's
00:08:08.319 family. No one knows you better or cares
00:08:11.759 more deeply about you than he does. Turn
00:08:15.759 to him. Pour out your heart to him.
00:08:19.120 Trust him and his promises.
00:08:22.080 You have family in your savior Jesus
00:08:24.479 Christ who loves you. He He came to
00:08:27.520 earth to atone for our sins and bear the
00:08:30.639 burden of our mistakes and our very bad
00:08:34.399 days. He understands what you are facing
00:08:38.399 and feeling. Turn to him. Trust he will
00:08:41.839 send the Holy Ghost to be with you, lift
00:08:44.959 you, and guide you. Feel their love that
00:08:48.640 shedth itself abroad in the hearts of
00:08:51.680 the children of men. It is the most
00:08:54.240 desirable above all things and the most
00:08:58.000 joyous to the soul.
00:09:02.160 All of the Lord's apostles
00:09:04.720 love you dearly.
00:09:07.040 We pray for you and seek the light the
00:09:10.160 Lord's guidance for you.
00:09:13.200 Stay with us.
00:09:15.279 You live in challenging times when the
00:09:17.600 adversary seeks to make you his. Do not
00:09:21.040 be drawn off. And if you are, come back.
00:09:25.839 Our arms reach out to you as will those
00:09:29.680 others who love you. The proclamation
00:09:33.519 states, "Parents have a sacred duty to
00:09:37.279 rear their rear their children in love
00:09:40.240 and righteousness."
00:09:42.080 The Book of Mormon provides a second
00:09:44.240 witness to this truth.
00:09:47.360 In the first verse of the first chapter,
00:09:50.640 we read, "I, Nephi, having been born of
00:09:54.399 goodly parents."
00:09:56.480 How many of us have started the Book of
00:09:58.560 Mormon and started again and again and
00:10:02.480 in the process committed those words to
00:10:05.360 memory? Commit them to heart.
00:10:09.920 One of my favorite statements in the
00:10:11.920 proclamation is this.
00:10:14.640 Family happiness in family life is most
00:10:18.240 likely to be achieved when founded upon
00:10:21.120 the teachings of Jesus Christ.
00:10:24.480 Who does not want to be happy?
00:10:27.440 And what are the teachings of Jesus
00:10:29.440 Christ? Again, in the proclamation,
00:10:33.040 faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness,
00:10:36.399 respect, love, compassion, work, and
00:10:39.440 wholesome recreational activities.
00:10:43.680 whose life will not be better by
00:10:45.760 applying these key principles.
00:10:49.200 None of us are going to do perfectly.
00:10:52.560 But we can follow President Hinckley's
00:10:55.040 wise words, do the very best you can.
00:11:00.240 We read in the proclamation, fathers are
00:11:03.120 to preside in love and righteousness,
00:11:05.839 and mothers are primarily responsible
00:11:08.800 for the nurture of their children.
00:11:12.240 Preside does not mean dominate and
00:11:15.519 nurture does not mean a secondary role.
00:11:19.680 God has given men and women different
00:11:22.880 but equal and essential roles that
00:11:26.160 complement each other.
00:11:29.200 Let me share a personal story.
00:11:32.000 My wife and I learned to work to better
00:11:34.320 at share at being equal partners. After
00:11:37.519 one day when I decided to make an
00:11:40.240 important decision without consulting
00:11:44.240 her,
00:11:45.839 my actions surprised her, took her off
00:11:49.120 guard, and put her in a very difficult
00:11:52.000 situation.
00:11:53.839 Afterwards, she put her hands on my
00:11:57.200 shoulders and firmly said, "Ron, please
00:12:03.200 never do that to me again."
00:12:06.320 We've pretty much been on the same page
00:12:08.560 ever since.
00:12:11.839 We find in the family proclamation,
00:12:14.800 fathers and mothers are obligated to
00:12:17.040 help one another as equal partners.
00:12:21.200 Equal is a word that matters.
00:12:23.600 Over the years, as Sister Rasband and I
00:12:25.920 have worked together in what the
00:12:28.000 proclamation describes as our sacred
00:12:30.959 responsibilities,
00:12:32.480 we have shaped an equally yolked
00:12:34.720 marriage. As each of our children are
00:12:37.760 now married, Sister Rasband and I have
00:12:40.480 continued to counsel them and their
00:12:43.440 spouses on how to be equal partners.
00:12:47.440 When we live with our eyes single to the
00:12:49.839 glory of God, we respect one another and
00:12:53.440 support one another. Those divine
00:12:56.240 patterns of righteousness lead to
00:12:58.880 stability in our individual lives and
00:13:02.560 our families and in society. Our father
00:13:07.120 in heaven has provided the proclamation
00:13:09.920 on the family to help guide us come home
00:13:12.639 to him to help us learn to be filled
00:13:15.440 with love and strength, purpose and
00:13:18.320 eternal understanding.
00:13:20.720 With all my soul, I plead with you to
00:13:23.760 live close to him and his beloved son. I
00:13:27.760 promise as you do so, the spirit will
00:13:30.560 inspire and guide you and help you feel
00:13:33.279 in your heart their promised peace that
00:13:37.200 passes all understanding.
00:13:40.240 In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
