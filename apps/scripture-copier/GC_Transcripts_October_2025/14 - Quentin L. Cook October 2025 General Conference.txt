00:00:01.760 Thank you for that precious rendition.
00:00:05.680 Charles Dickens famously began his
00:00:08.400 classic novel, A Tale of Two Cities,
00:00:11.840 with the assertion that it was the best
00:00:14.400 of times, it was the worst of times. In
00:00:17.920 a sense, this is true in our day. We
00:00:21.760 live in a turbulent time when the whole
00:00:24.400 earth is in commotion.
00:00:26.960 President Russell M. Nelson's admonition
00:00:30.000 as followers of Jesus Christ to be
00:00:33.360 peacemakers
00:00:35.040 was emphasized beautifully this morning
00:00:38.000 by Elder Gary E. Stevenson.
00:00:41.280 This is an essential part of fostering
00:00:44.160 unity, peace, and healing for the worst
00:00:48.239 of times.
00:00:50.079 We also live in the best of times which
00:00:52.719 will be my emphasis.
00:00:55.039 The Lord in the preface to the Doctrine
00:00:56.960 and Covenant section one declared, "The
00:00:59.920 fullness of the gospel would be
00:01:01.760 proclaimed unto the ends of the world."
00:01:05.360 The Lord is truly hastening his work in
00:01:08.720 our time. We should be profoundly
00:01:11.920 grateful for the hastening which has and
00:01:15.280 is occurring despite these challenging
00:01:18.400 times. We live in a day when the Lord's
00:01:22.000 followers are privileged to hear his
00:01:23.840 voice and respond with open hearts and
00:01:26.880 minds. Members of the Church of Jesus
00:01:29.840 Christ of Latter-day Saints who are
00:01:32.640 committed to the Savior and his
00:01:34.960 commandments are finding purpose and
00:01:38.640 profound personal peace. At various
00:01:42.240 times in the history of the church,
00:01:44.000 there has been a significant increase in
00:01:46.880 those who have entered the covenant
00:01:48.479 path. One such period occurred between
00:01:51.439 1837 and 1850.
00:01:54.560 Some of the early apostles in the Lord's
00:01:57.040 restored church served missions in the
00:01:59.680 United Kingdom.
00:02:01.600 This these missions resulted in
00:02:03.680 thousands joining the church and by 1850
00:02:07.920 there were more members of the church
00:02:10.000 living in the United Kingdom than in the
00:02:12.560 United States. At that time the Lord
00:02:15.680 directed these saints to gather to Utah.
00:02:19.280 A mass immigration occurred, some
00:02:22.480 supported by loans provided through the
00:02:25.599 perpetual immigrating fund. I love the
00:02:29.280 account of the arrival to the Salt Lake
00:02:31.599 Valley of a large number of converts
00:02:34.400 from England and Wales in 1852.
00:02:38.480 The group was met by the First
00:02:40.239 Presidency at the mouth of Immigration
00:02:42.640 Canyon accompanied by Captain Pitt's
00:02:46.080 band. The Desireette News described them
00:02:49.360 as quote, "a band of pilgrims, including
00:02:52.879 sisters and children, walking sunburnden
00:02:55.920 and weatherbeaten, but not forlororn.
00:02:59.599 Their hearts were light and buoyant,
00:03:02.640 which was plainly manifest by their
00:03:05.040 happy and joyful countenances."
00:03:08.480 As they passed the temple block,
00:03:10.480 thousands of men, women, and children
00:03:13.200 gathered from various parts of the city
00:03:15.680 to unite in the glorious and joyful
00:03:18.640 welcome. President Brigham Young
00:03:21.280 addressed them.
00:03:23.280 May the Lord God of Israel bless you. We
00:03:27.840 have prayed for you continually.
00:03:30.400 Thousands of prayers have been offered
00:03:32.400 up for you day by day to him who has
00:03:36.239 commanded us to gather Israel, save the
00:03:40.000 children of men by the preaching of the
00:03:42.319 gospel, and prepare them for the coming
00:03:45.760 of the Messiah." End quote.
00:03:49.120 In the spirit of that joyful occasion,
00:03:52.159 let me once again assure all new
00:03:55.040 converts
00:03:56.560 and those returning to the Lord's
00:03:58.879 church,
00:04:00.480 we love you. We need you. The Lord needs
00:04:04.480 you.
00:04:06.080 You may not, we may not welcome you with
00:04:08.879 marching bands, but we pray the
00:04:11.760 blessings of heaven will attend your
00:04:14.159 efforts to progress along the covenant
00:04:17.358 path that leads to God the Father and
00:04:20.720 Jesus Christ in the celestial kingdom.
00:04:24.639 There is clear evidence that faith in
00:04:26.560 Jesus Christ is increasing in our day.
00:04:29.840 In the Church of Jesus Christ of
00:04:31.440 Latter-day Saints, there has been a
00:04:33.360 remarkable increase in converts and
00:04:37.360 convert participation.
00:04:40.000 In the last 36 months, nearly 900,000
00:04:45.600 converts have joined the church. These
00:04:49.040 converts constitute approximately 5%
00:04:52.960 of the total church membership.
00:04:55.680 We welcome new members with open arms
00:04:58.240 and deep appreciation for the path you
00:05:00.720 have chosen.
00:05:02.400 These 900,000 converts in the last 36
00:05:06.080 months exceed the total membership of
00:05:09.520 the church at its 110th anniversary in
00:05:14.320 1940
00:05:16.160 which was just over 860,000 members.
00:05:20.880 That was the year elders Jeffrey R.
00:05:22.960 Holland, Elder, Elder Derer Fukdorf and
00:05:26.160 I were born. These wonderful new
00:05:29.600 converts come from every part of the
00:05:32.560 world. In the first six months of this
00:05:35.520 year, conversions have ri risen by more
00:05:38.320 than 20% over the previous year in
00:05:41.440 Europe, Africa, Asia, the Pacific, and
00:05:45.360 Latin America. In North America, we have
00:05:48.320 seen a 17% increase. The Lord's word
00:05:52.320 continues to move forward in powerful
00:05:54.560 ways. These rising numbers are a clear
00:05:57.919 witness that the gospel is touching
00:06:01.120 hearts and changing lives everywhere.
00:06:05.600 In our day, these precious converts no
00:06:08.400 longer gather to a central location
00:06:12.080 because of the faith and consecration of
00:06:14.560 the members of the church. Reese's
00:06:17.120 resources are available to support
00:06:19.280 congregations with the constructions of
00:06:22.000 chapels and temples across the entire
00:06:25.360 world. With the necessary priesthood
00:06:28.080 keys and the resources provided, saving
00:06:31.440 ordinances are now available in most
00:06:34.479 parts of the world.
00:06:36.720 Regardless of where we live, current
00:06:39.360 members need to welcome hundreds of
00:06:42.080 thousands of new members as we did the
00:06:45.280 English and Welch saints I described
00:06:47.680 from our early history. I loved Elder
00:06:50.720 Garrett W. Gong's talk in this session
00:06:54.160 where he taught us that no one should
00:06:56.000 sit alone either emotionally or
00:06:58.400 spiritually. Our sacred duty is to
00:07:01.680 accept and welcome new and returning
00:07:04.000 members. As the Lord hastens his work,
00:07:07.520 we should love, nurture, and serve those
00:07:11.440 who accept his gospel. We can help build
00:07:14.800 a Zion people where we are one of one
00:07:18.000 heart and one mind and dwell in
00:07:20.400 righteousness. To be one with the Lord,
00:07:24.080 we must be one before the Lord. All
00:07:27.599 members, regardless of baptism date,
00:07:30.720 share a responsibility to welcome
00:07:32.960 others. My council to the members of the
00:07:36.000 church is to wrap our arms around these
00:07:39.120 precious elect people who have accepted
00:07:42.000 the gospel of Jesus Christ. President
00:07:45.199 Gordon B. Hinckley taught us that a new
00:07:48.000 convert needs a friend, a
00:07:49.919 responsibility, and nurturing with the
00:07:52.560 good word of God.
00:07:54.720 We can be among the friends who assure
00:07:57.759 these new converts that they belong and
00:08:01.520 are not just guests and don't sit alone.
00:08:05.120 We can help them understand that they
00:08:06.960 are disciples of Jesus Christ who can
00:08:10.080 minister to others and accept callings
00:08:13.280 to serve. Young converts should consider
00:08:17.280 serving a full-time mission.
00:08:20.160 All should be determined to strive to
00:08:22.800 live a Christlike life. Many join the
00:08:26.240 church at great personal sacrifice and
00:08:28.960 desperately need the love and support of
00:08:31.280 their fellow saints. To those of you who
00:08:34.240 are new or returning to the faith, there
00:08:37.120 are challenges you may face. Be patient
00:08:40.799 with yourself. The missionaries have
00:08:43.519 taught you the essential doctrine and
00:08:46.399 explained the covenants and ordinances
00:08:48.959 of the kingdom which are set forth in
00:08:51.680 the scriptures and in preach my gospel.
00:08:54.640 Receiving the ordinances and covenants
00:08:56.880 and living the commandments are
00:08:58.800 essential.
00:09:00.399 Focus on the covenants necessary for
00:09:03.519 exaltation.
00:09:05.440 The gospel makes exaltation possible
00:09:08.880 which requires the making and keeping of
00:09:12.160 sacred covenants with God. Except for
00:09:15.279 baptism, confirmation, and the conferral
00:09:18.640 of the mechdic priesthood for men, the
00:09:21.839 covenants we enter are performed in the
00:09:24.320 temple. For the dead, each of these
00:09:27.440 saving ordinances are only performed in
00:09:30.480 the temple. Accordingly,
00:09:33.760 preparing yourself for the temple should
00:09:37.040 be an immediate goal. You will at times
00:09:40.240 feel inadequate about what you know.
00:09:43.040 Gospel knowledge is a great blessing
00:09:45.360 obtained incrementally over time, but it
00:09:49.040 is not a saving ordinance. The gospel is
00:09:52.399 not a test of knowledge. However, as
00:09:55.680 President Nelson has promised, as you
00:09:58.560 prayerfully study the Book of Mormon
00:10:00.399 every day, you will make better
00:10:02.560 decisions every day. As you ponder what
00:10:05.360 you study, the windows of heaven will
00:10:08.480 open and you will receive answers to
00:10:10.800 your own questions and direction for
00:10:13.519 your own life. In addition, each year in
00:10:17.040 rotation, the church curriculum in
00:10:20.160 Sunday meetings covers the Old
00:10:22.480 Testament, the New Testament, the Book
00:10:24.320 of Mormon, and the Doctrine and
00:10:26.079 Covenants. Over time, you will feel more
00:10:29.680 confident as your gospel knowledge
00:10:32.800 grows. Regular study of the scriptures
00:10:35.680 will bless and enrich your lives by
00:10:39.120 deepening your conversion to the gospel
00:10:41.760 of Jesus Christ.
00:10:44.480 Learning the pure doctrine of Jesus
00:10:46.560 Christ is a lifelong pursuit both in
00:10:49.760 understanding doctrine and living a
00:10:52.480 Christlike life. Essential covenants
00:10:55.440 provide a framework which we describe as
00:10:58.560 the covenant path. These principles have
00:11:01.920 been powerfully taught by President
00:11:03.760 Nelson. All members, especially new and
00:11:07.519 returning ones, would be blessed by
00:11:10.160 studying and adopting his prophetic
00:11:13.200 messages on covenants and the covenant
00:11:15.920 path. If you set a goal of worthily
00:11:18.880 receiving each covenant necessary for
00:11:21.120 exaltation, you will be on the path that
00:11:24.399 leads to the celestial kingdom. The
00:11:27.120 temple and the ordinances of the temple
00:11:29.120 should be our focus. Most covenants are
00:11:32.000 available to each individual. One
00:11:34.880 covenant, eternal marriage, involves
00:11:37.680 uniting your efforts with a companion.
00:11:40.640 Our goal should be to find that eternal
00:11:43.680 companion. However,
00:11:46.399 do not get discouraged if eternal
00:11:48.640 marriage is not possible at this time.
00:11:52.320 Prophets have taught that no blessing
00:11:54.399 will be withheld from faithful members
00:11:57.360 who keep the commandments. One Book of
00:12:00.240 Mormon prophet, King Benjamin, said it
00:12:02.480 beautifully. Quote, "Those that keep the
00:12:05.600 commandments of God are blessed in all
00:12:07.680 things, and if they are faithful to the
00:12:10.240 end, they may dwell with God in a state
00:12:13.200 of neverending happiness.
00:12:15.760 You will find, if you have not already,
00:12:19.120 that the members are not perfect.
00:12:21.519 Revealed doctrine makes it clear that in
00:12:24.399 our sojourn here on earth, we will make
00:12:27.279 mistakes. We live in an imperfect and
00:12:30.800 fallen world, not a celestial world.
00:12:34.079 This life is a time of testing with
00:12:36.720 constant opportunities to repent and
00:12:39.440 prove ourselves. All of us feel
00:12:42.240 inadequate as we strive to become like
00:12:45.279 Jesus Christ. His atonement allows us to
00:12:49.040 repent daily as we fall short. As Nephi,
00:12:53.600 another Book of Mormon prophet, said,
00:12:56.560 "We must press forward with a
00:12:58.240 steadfastness in Christ, having a
00:13:00.959 perfect brightness of hope and a love of
00:13:03.200 God and of all men. Wherefore, if he
00:13:07.040 shall press forward, feasting upon the
00:13:09.760 word of Christ, and endure to the end,
00:13:13.360 behold, thus saith the Father, ye shall
00:13:16.320 have eternal life." As we contemplate
00:13:20.160 the challenges of our day, we must
00:13:23.040 remember that the Savior during his
00:13:26.160 earthly ministry also lived in turbulent
00:13:30.160 and violent times. His focus was not on
00:13:33.920 the political challenges of the day. It
00:13:37.040 was on the perfection of the saints.
00:13:40.480 Following the Savior and his doctrine
00:13:42.959 and teachings has never been easy in a
00:13:46.240 world that is constantly in commotion.
00:13:49.680 It was not easy for the Savior in the
00:13:52.959 volatile world during his mortal
00:13:56.320 souljourn. It was not easy for our early
00:13:59.600 leaders and members and it is not easy
00:14:02.959 for us.
00:14:04.800 Fortunately, living prophets provide the
00:14:07.839 guidance we respectfully need for our
00:14:10.399 day. President Don H. Oaks will continue
00:14:15.360 that spiritually powerful legacy.
00:14:19.440 I testify that the doctrine of the
00:14:22.160 church of Jesus Christ is eternal and
00:14:25.360 true. I bear my sure and certain witness
00:14:28.800 that Jesus Christ lives and because of
00:14:32.240 his atonement we can be one with him in
00:14:37.040 the sacred name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
00:14:40.480 Amen.
