00:00:00.800 In 2018 at the University of Utah, a
00:00:04.560 special professorship was created called
00:00:06.799 the Dr. Russell M. Nelson and Dansel W.
00:00:10.320 Nelson Presidential Chair in
00:00:12.639 cardiothoracic surgery. Cardio meaning
00:00:15.360 heart, thoracic meaning chest. It
00:00:18.960 honored President Nelson's important
00:00:20.880 work as a heart surgeon and the support
00:00:23.760 he received from his late wife Dansel.
00:00:28.000 This professorship was paid for by a
00:00:30.240 fund designed to last into the future.
00:00:33.680 The individual selected for this type of
00:00:36.079 prestigious professorship receives
00:00:38.640 recognition, salary support, and
00:00:41.520 research funds.
00:00:43.840 The first surgeon chosen to hold the
00:00:46.160 professorship was Dr. Craig H. Selman, a
00:00:50.480 skilled heart surgeon who's not a member
00:00:52.480 of the church.
00:00:54.879 At the ceremony to reward to award this
00:00:57.440 professorship to Dr. Selman, many
00:01:00.399 important guests were in attendance,
00:01:02.719 including President Nelson and his wife,
00:01:05.840 Sister Wendy W. Nelson.
00:01:08.640 During the meeting, President Nelson
00:01:10.640 spoke modestly of his pioneering
00:01:13.200 surgical career.
00:01:15.439 Then, Dr. Selman shared what it meant to
00:01:18.240 him to be appointed to this
00:01:20.320 professorship.
00:01:22.080 He related that four days earlier, after
00:01:24.960 a long day in the operating room, he
00:01:28.000 discovered that one of his patients
00:01:30.080 needed to go back to surgery. He was
00:01:33.040 tired and disappointed, knowing he'd
00:01:36.320 have to spend another night in the
00:01:38.640 hospital.
00:01:40.320 This evening, Dr. Selman had a
00:01:42.640 life-changing conversation with himself.
00:01:46.640 In the moment, he thought, "On Friday,
00:01:50.399 I'll be appointed to a professorship
00:01:52.640 named after Dr. Nelson." He was always
00:01:55.759 known as someone who kept his emotions
00:01:58.159 in check, treated everyone with respect,
00:02:01.439 and never lost his temper. Now that my
00:02:04.159 name will be linked with his, I need to
00:02:07.280 try to be more like him.
00:02:10.239 Dr. Salesman was already a very
00:02:12.959 considerate surgeon, but he wanted to
00:02:15.680 become even better.
00:02:18.239 In the past, his surgical team might
00:02:20.480 have been aware of his fatigue and
00:02:22.319 frustration because it may he may have
00:02:24.879 let it show in his manner and tone of
00:02:27.200 voice.
00:02:28.720 But in the operating room that night,
00:02:31.840 Dr. Selman made a conscientious effort
00:02:35.599 to be especially supportive and
00:02:37.599 understanding of his team.
00:02:40.080 He felt it made a difference and
00:02:42.959 resolved to continue trying to be more
00:02:46.000 like Dr. Nelson.
00:02:48.879 Five years later, President Nelson
00:02:51.120 donated his professional papers to the
00:02:53.840 University of Utah. Dignitaries from the
00:02:56.879 university came to formally thank
00:02:59.040 President Nelson.
00:03:00.879 During this event, Dr. Sell Smith spoke
00:03:04.159 again
00:03:05.840 referring to President Nelson's initials
00:03:08.720 RMN.
00:03:11.120 He said there is an RMN ethos that now
00:03:16.159 pervades the division of cardiothoracic
00:03:18.400 surgery at the University of Utah. In
00:03:20.959 frustrating situations, Dr. Selzman
00:03:23.680 explained, I do what we now teach our
00:03:26.319 trainees to do. Focus, get over it, and
00:03:30.159 do the best you can. This ethos lives in
00:03:33.519 us every day. We give lapel pins to
00:03:36.959 every member of the division and each
00:03:39.200 new trainee. At the bottom of the pin
00:03:42.480 are the letters RMN.
00:03:45.920 The RMN ethos is foundational to our
00:03:49.360 training. We teach it to everyone.
00:03:53.599 Dr. Selzman had intentionally improved
00:03:56.480 his prior attitude and aspirations
00:03:59.439 because his name was now linked to that
00:04:02.640 of President Nelson.
00:04:05.920 This series of events involving Dr.
00:04:08.560 Selzman caused me to ask myself,
00:04:12.640 how have I changed since I linked my
00:04:16.478 name with the name of Jesus Christ?
00:04:20.959 Have I adopted a Christ-like ethos as a
00:04:23.520 result? Have I genuinely tried to become
00:04:26.320 better and more like him?
00:04:30.000 In Dr. Selman's experience, we can see
00:04:32.560 at least five parallels to the process
00:04:35.040 through which we take upon ourselves the
00:04:37.680 name of Jesus Christ.
00:04:40.240 Even though that process begins with
00:04:42.320 baptism,
00:04:43.840 it's not complete until we are more pure
00:04:47.520 and holy and have become more like him.
00:04:51.759 The first parallel is identification.
00:04:56.000 Dr. Selman's appointment to the Nelson
00:04:58.479 professorship linked his name to
00:05:01.040 President Nelson's and Dr. Selman began
00:05:03.840 to identify with President Nelson.
00:05:06.880 When we take upon ourselves the name of
00:05:09.199 Jesus Christ, we link our name with his.
00:05:12.639 We identify with him. We gladly become
00:05:16.000 known as Christian. We acknowledge the
00:05:18.960 savior and unapologetically stand up to
00:05:22.320 be counted as his.
00:05:25.280 Closely related to identification is
00:05:27.759 another parallel, remembrance.
00:05:31.440 When Dr. Selzman goes into his office.
00:05:34.400 His eyes are drawn to the medallion he
00:05:36.880 received when he was appointed to the
00:05:39.440 Nelson Professorship.
00:05:41.680 This medallion reminds him daily of the
00:05:45.120 RMN ethos.
00:05:48.000 For us, partaking of the sacrament each
00:05:50.960 week helps us remember Jesus Christ
00:05:54.160 throughout the week. As we partake of
00:05:57.360 the sacrament, we do so in remembrance
00:06:00.000 of the price he paid to redeem us. We
00:06:04.720 covenant a new to remember him,
00:06:09.039 recognize his greatness, and appreciate
00:06:12.400 his goodness. We acknowledge repeatedly
00:06:15.520 that it is only in and through his grace
00:06:18.560 that we're safe from physical and
00:06:20.639 spiritual death. Remembrance
00:06:24.000 means that we follow the advice given by
00:06:26.080 the Book of Mormon prophet Elma.
00:06:29.280 We let all our doings be unto the Lord.
00:06:32.000 And whethersoever we go, we let it be in
00:06:34.720 the Lord. We let all our thoughts be
00:06:37.280 directed unto the Lord. And we let the
00:06:40.479 affections of our heart be placed upon
00:06:43.039 the Lord forever.
00:06:45.919 Even when we're occupied with other
00:06:47.759 matters, we remain mindful of him just
00:06:51.840 as we remember our own name, regardless
00:06:54.960 of what else we focus on.
00:06:58.000 An outgrowth of remembering what the
00:07:00.400 Savior's done for us is a third
00:07:02.319 parallel,
00:07:03.840 emulation.
00:07:05.759 Dr. Selman began to emulate President
00:07:08.560 Nelson and the RMN ethos.
00:07:13.759 I believe President Nelson's ethos is
00:07:17.039 simply a manifesta manifestation of his
00:07:20.080 lifelong disciplehip
00:07:22.319 of Jesus Christ.
00:07:24.800 For us, the more we identify with and
00:07:28.400 remember Jesus Christ, the more we want
00:07:31.440 to be like him.
00:07:33.919 As his disciples, we change for the
00:07:36.080 better when we focus on him more so than
00:07:40.720 when we focus on ourselves.
00:07:43.120 We strive to become like him and seek to
00:07:46.160 be blessed with his attributes.
00:07:49.520 We pray fervently to be filled with
00:07:52.160 charity, the pure love of Christ.
00:07:55.680 As President Nelson taught in April,
00:07:59.280 as charity becomes part of our nature,
00:08:02.479 we'll lose the impulse to demean others.
00:08:06.160 We'll stop judging others. We'll have
00:08:09.120 charity for those from all walks of
00:08:11.199 life.
00:08:12.879 Charity towards all is essential to our
00:08:15.360 progress. Charity is the foundation of a
00:08:18.720 godly character.
00:08:20.720 Alongside charity, we seek, cultivate,
00:08:25.440 and expand other spiritual gifts from
00:08:28.240 the Savior, including integrity,
00:08:32.080 patience, and diligence.
00:08:35.679 Emulating Jesus Christ leads us to a
00:08:38.799 fourth parallel, alignment with his
00:08:41.679 purposes. We join him in his work.
00:08:46.240 As a surgeon, Dr. Nelson was known as a
00:08:50.160 teacher, a healer, and a researcher.
00:08:54.959 The lapel pin used in Dr. Selman's
00:08:57.760 division emphasizes these endeavors
00:09:00.480 featuring the words teach, heal, and
00:09:04.640 discover.
00:09:06.800 For us, part of taking upon ourselves
00:09:09.519 the name of Jesus Christ involves
00:09:12.320 willingly,
00:09:13.839 intentionally, and enthusiastically
00:09:17.120 aligning our goals with his. We join him
00:09:20.959 in his work when we love, share, and
00:09:23.360 invite. We join him in his work when we
00:09:26.640 minister to others, especially the
00:09:29.920 vulnerable and those who have been
00:09:32.000 wounded, shattered, or crushed by their
00:09:36.000 earthly experiences.
00:09:38.800 So we more fully take upon ourselves the
00:09:42.720 name of Jesus Christ through
00:09:44.959 identification,
00:09:46.720 remembrance,
00:09:48.240 emulation, and alignment.
00:09:51.680 Doing these four leads to a fifth
00:09:54.160 parallel,
00:09:55.680 empowerment.
00:09:57.279 We access God's power and blessings in
00:10:00.399 our lives.
00:10:02.480 The Nelson Professorship provides Dr.
00:10:05.120 Seltzman recognition and support funds
00:10:07.760 that he's using to change the culture in
00:10:10.560 his division. He applies this endowment
00:10:13.680 of power to help others. In a similar
00:10:16.880 way, when we take upon ourselves the
00:10:20.160 name of the Savior, our heavenly father
00:10:23.040 blesses us with his power to help us
00:10:26.160 fulfill our mission and mortality.
00:10:29.680 As we make additional covenants with
00:10:31.760 God, we take upon ourselves more fully
00:10:35.200 the name of Jesus Christ. Consequently,
00:10:38.720 God blesses us with more of his power.
00:10:42.880 As President Nelson taught, each person
00:10:46.079 who makes covenants in baptismal fonts
00:10:48.560 and in temples and keeps them has
00:10:51.680 increased access to the power of Jesus
00:10:54.560 Christ.
00:10:56.160 The reward for keeping covenants with
00:10:58.320 God is heavenly power that strengthens
00:11:01.040 us to withstand our trials, temptations,
00:11:04.240 and heartaches better.
00:11:07.200 We become more spiritually receptive. We
00:11:10.160 have more courage to confront seemingly
00:11:12.560 impossible circumstances.
00:11:15.040 We're strengthened more in our resolve
00:11:17.120 to follow Jesus Christ. We more speedily
00:11:20.399 repent and return to him when we
00:11:22.560 transgress.
00:11:24.240 We become better at sharing his gospel
00:11:26.800 with his power and authority. We help
00:11:30.480 those in need while being less
00:11:32.560 judgmental.
00:11:34.240 Far less judgmental.
00:11:36.480 We retain a remission of our sins.
00:11:39.600 We have greater peace and we're more
00:11:42.720 cheerful because we can always rejoice.
00:11:47.760 His glory will be round about us and his
00:11:50.720 angels will have charge over us.
00:11:54.880 The Savior invites us, "Come unto the
00:11:58.320 Father in my name
00:12:02.640 and in due time receive of his
00:12:04.320 fullness."
00:12:05.920 I urge you to do this. Come unto our
00:12:09.279 heavenly father. Take upon yourself the
00:12:12.560 name of Jesus Christ. Identify with him.
00:12:17.200 Always remember him. Strive to be like
00:12:20.160 him. Join him in his work. Receive his
00:12:24.240 power and blessings in your life.
00:12:27.920 Etch his name in your heart willingly
00:12:32.000 and intentionally.
00:12:34.560 This gives you standing before God and
00:12:38.079 qualifies you for the Savior's advocacy
00:12:40.880 on your behalf.
00:12:43.040 You'll become an exalted inheritor in
00:12:45.360 the kingdom of our father in heaven, a
00:12:48.000 joint heir with his firstborn,
00:12:50.800 our beloved savior and redeemer. He
00:12:54.240 lives. I absolutely know it. He loves
00:12:57.600 you. He gave his life for you. He pleads
00:13:01.200 with you to come unto the father through
00:13:03.440 him in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
00:13:07.839 Amen.
