00:00:01.839 If you've ever visited our home state of
00:00:04.400 Louisiana, you're probably familiar with
00:00:07.279 many of our tasty dishes. Gumbo,
00:00:10.639 jumbolaya, a2 fake, and the list goes on
00:00:14.320 and on. From time to time, I find myself
00:00:18.320 feeling bold enough to cook one of those
00:00:20.880 tasty recipes.
00:00:23.119 The undocumented final step after mixing
00:00:27.279 all the ingredients and following the
00:00:30.320 detailed instructions is to do the final
00:00:33.360 taste test and see if anything is
00:00:36.000 missing. At that point, I could hear the
00:00:39.600 Creole cooking legends whispering in my
00:00:42.640 ears, "Put more Tony's in it." Tony's is
00:00:46.960 a creole season. A creole seasoning made
00:00:50.320 in Apolloas, Louisiana. my hometown.
00:00:54.320 It's often used as the secret ingredient
00:00:58.480 to compensate for the imperfections made
00:01:01.680 while following the recipe.
00:01:05.600 Michelle and I had the honor to serve as
00:01:08.400 mission leaders in Louisiana.
00:01:10.960 We had a tradition of teaching the
00:01:12.799 missionaries how to cook her special
00:01:15.760 jumbolaya recipe on their last night in
00:01:18.960 the mission home before returning to
00:01:21.200 their families. In addition to their
00:01:24.479 testimonies of the restored gospel of
00:01:27.040 Jesus Christ, our missionaries left the
00:01:30.320 mission with an appreciation for
00:01:33.200 recipes.
00:01:35.280 A few months ago, I was browsing through
00:01:38.240 the church media library and saw a link
00:01:41.600 to a collection of short videos called
00:01:45.119 Restoration Conversations with President
00:01:48.640 Russell M. Nelson. The title of one of
00:01:51.920 those short videos in the list caught my
00:01:54.560 attention and made me smile. It was
00:01:57.520 called Scriptures Are God's Recipes for
00:02:02.000 Happy Living.
00:02:03.759 I immediately clicked on that twominute
00:02:06.079 video and watched President Nelson teach
00:02:09.840 a group of primary kids a simple and
00:02:13.520 powerful message about how to be happy.
00:02:17.120 He taught if you're making a cake, you
00:02:20.480 follow the directions, don't you? And
00:02:23.680 you'll get a good result every time,
00:02:26.959 won't you? He continued, speaking about
00:02:30.720 turning 95 years old soon. People say,
00:02:34.959 "What do you eat? What's your secret?"
00:02:38.160 He replied, "The secrets called the
00:02:41.280 scriptures. You might read them and try
00:02:45.280 them." End quote. Well, there we have
00:02:49.440 it. The simple secret for happy living
00:02:52.800 is to just follow God's recipe as
00:02:56.239 detailed in the scriptures.
00:02:58.480 I call it the good news recipe.
00:03:02.560 What do you do if something goes wrong
00:03:04.720 when following the recipe?
00:03:07.599 We all
00:03:12.480 Well, embedded in the good news recipe
00:03:15.200 is is the secret ingredient to ensure we
00:03:18.959 always get it right in the end. The
00:03:21.360 answer is always Jesus Christ. I think
00:03:25.920 we all have moments when we feel our
00:03:28.159 ingredients are not good enough or we
00:03:31.280 struggle to follow the directions or
00:03:34.159 perhaps we do something out of order or
00:03:37.519 something happens that's out of our
00:03:39.200 control and so on. What's the remedy?
00:03:43.920 It's simply to add more of what invites
00:03:47.519 Jesus Christ into your life.
00:03:50.879 So, what might it look like to add more
00:03:53.599 Jesus Christ in your life? While serving
00:03:56.799 as mission president, I had the pleasure
00:03:59.599 of meeting personally with each of our
00:04:02.319 young missionaries every six weeks.
00:04:05.599 During the one-on-one meeting, it was
00:04:08.080 common for missionaries to seek guidance
00:04:10.959 on how to improve the effectiveness of
00:04:13.680 their companionships.
00:04:15.840 On one occasion, a missionary came into
00:04:18.720 his personal interview and sat down. I
00:04:22.079 could tell from his body language that
00:04:24.560 something was weighing heavily on his
00:04:26.320 mind. I asked, "Eldder, what would you
00:04:29.919 like to discuss today?" He went on to
00:04:33.040 describe some challenges he was having
00:04:35.120 with his companion and how it was
00:04:37.759 affecting their ability to do missionary
00:04:40.080 work. With tears in his eyes, he looked
00:04:44.240 at me and asked, "President,
00:04:47.280 what should I do in that instance, I
00:04:51.680 honestly didn't know how to respond."
00:04:54.960 After a brief moment, I asked if it was
00:04:57.919 okay for us to kneel together in prayer
00:05:01.199 for guidance from the spirit. He agreed,
00:05:04.639 and we knelt together and prayed for
00:05:06.800 inspiration.
00:05:08.639 After the prayer, we continued kneeling
00:05:11.199 for a short time and then sat in our
00:05:14.080 chairs facing each other. I asked if we
00:05:16.960 could read a scripture together. As we
00:05:19.759 open our scriptures, I paused and told
00:05:23.039 him, "Elder,
00:05:25.440 as we read this scripture, please ask
00:05:28.560 yourself the following question.
00:05:31.759 If I live these attributes,
00:05:34.639 will it improve my companionship
00:05:38.080 and our missionary work? Then we opened
00:05:41.680 Moroni 7:45
00:05:44.080 and read out loud.
00:05:47.039 And charity suffereth long, and is kind,
00:05:50.639 and envith not, and is not puffed up,
00:05:54.400 seeketh not her own, is not easily
00:05:57.600 provoked. Thinkketh no evil, and
00:06:00.639 rejoicth not in iniquity, but rejoicth
00:06:04.000 in the truth, beareth all things,
00:06:07.199 believeth all things, hopeeth all
00:06:10.000 things, endureth all things. Then the
00:06:14.000 elder looked at me with tears in his
00:06:16.880 eyes and said, "Yes, president, but that
00:06:20.080 is hard to do." I agreed. And I reminded
00:06:24.240 him that he is a son of God with divine
00:06:28.000 potential to do it together with the
00:06:30.240 Lord. Then we briefly discussed the
00:06:33.360 parable of the slope taught by Elder
00:06:36.080 Clark G. Gilbert of the 70 which
00:06:38.800 reminded us that we need to start where
00:06:41.840 we are and together with the Lord move
00:06:45.440 forward and upward in a positive
00:06:47.759 direction.
00:06:49.440 I could tell he was still feeling a bit
00:06:52.319 overwhelmed about the next step. So I
00:06:55.600 asked him to describe his understanding
00:06:58.479 of the scripture by small and simple
00:07:01.199 things are great things brought to pass.
00:07:04.800 He went on he went on to describe the
00:07:07.199 concept that by doing small and simple
00:07:10.080 things great things could happen. I
00:07:13.039 asked him to take a minute and identify
00:07:16.000 two small and simple things he could do
00:07:19.360 to be kind to his companion. After a few
00:07:22.479 moments he shared his thoughts. Then I
00:07:25.840 asked him to take a minute and identify
00:07:29.199 two small and simple things he could do
00:07:32.240 to be patient with his companion. He
00:07:35.520 almost immediately shared his two
00:07:37.440 thoughts. It was clear he had already
00:07:40.160 been pondering this before our meeting.
00:07:43.120 I invited him to take those few items to
00:07:46.000 God in prayer and to ask for
00:07:48.639 confirmation,
00:07:50.240 direction, and inspiration on how to
00:07:53.199 execute his plan with real intent.
00:07:57.680 He agreed. As we concluded, I asked him
00:08:01.440 to provide a brief update in his weekly
00:08:04.240 letter. As the next few weeks went by, I
00:08:08.319 could see in his weekly letters that
00:08:10.080 things were improving. But not only
00:08:12.639 could I see the improvement in his
00:08:14.800 weekly letters, I could also see it in
00:08:17.599 the weekly letters of his companion.
00:08:20.479 During our next our next in-person
00:08:22.560 interview, I saw a night and day
00:08:25.199 difference in his continence and spirit.
00:08:27.680 I asked him, "So, Elder, is it true that
00:08:30.960 charity never faileth?" He responded
00:08:33.839 with a big smile, "Yes, and by small and
00:08:37.839 simple things are great things brought
00:08:39.839 to pass.
00:08:41.599 As you follow the good news recipe for
00:08:44.480 happy living, remember President
00:08:46.959 Nelson's teaching. Whatever questions or
00:08:50.399 problems you have, the answer is always
00:08:54.320 found in the life and teachings of Jesus
00:08:56.640 Christ. Learn more about his atonement,
00:09:00.160 his love, his mercy, his doctrine, and
00:09:04.640 his restored gospel of healing and
00:09:07.120 progression. turn to him, follow him."
00:09:11.600 End quote. When you need to hear him and
00:09:15.839 know how to invite Jesus Christ into
00:09:18.080 your life, consider following the steps
00:09:21.040 President Nelson taught us about
00:09:23.440 personal revelation.
00:09:25.519 Quote, "Find a quiet place where you can
00:09:28.320 regularly go. Humble yourself before
00:09:31.839 God. Pour out your heart to your
00:09:34.640 heavenly father. Turn to him for answers
00:09:37.839 and for comfort. Pray in the name of
00:09:41.120 Jesus Christ about your concerns, your
00:09:43.920 fears, your weaknesses. Yes, the very
00:09:47.680 longings of your heart. And then listen.
00:09:51.600 Write the thoughts that come to your
00:09:53.440 mind. Recard your feelings and follow
00:09:57.040 through with the actions that you're
00:09:58.959 prompted to take. As you repeat this
00:10:01.839 process day after day, month after
00:10:04.640 month, year after year, you will grow
00:10:07.519 into the principle of revelation." End
00:10:10.160 quote. I testify that Jesus Christ is
00:10:13.600 our savior and redeemer. He has
00:10:16.000 accomplished everything we need to be
00:10:18.959 able to return to our heavenly father.
00:10:21.440 In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. Amen.
