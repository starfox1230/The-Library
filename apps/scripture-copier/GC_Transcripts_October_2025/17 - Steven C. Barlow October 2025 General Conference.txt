00:00:00.719 In the parable of the prodical son, the
00:00:03.840 elder brother initially struggled to
00:00:05.920 celebrate when his younger brother
00:00:08.000 returned home after a period of poor
00:00:10.880 choices and wasting his substance with
00:00:13.599 riotous living.
00:00:15.679 The elder brother's pride and
00:00:17.359 self-righteousness kept him from
00:00:19.920 embracing the joy of his brother's
00:00:22.080 repentant return.
00:00:24.400 We also may let opportunities pass us by
00:00:28.640 without letting our loved ones know
00:00:31.119 through our words and actions of our
00:00:33.680 sincere love for them. There are many
00:00:36.640 powerful examples in the scriptures of
00:00:39.280 sincere love shared and received. Naomi
00:00:43.120 and Ruth, Ammon and King Lemoni, the
00:00:46.719 prodical son and his father, the Savior
00:00:50.079 and his disciples.
00:00:52.399 When love is freely given and sincerely
00:00:55.280 received, a virtuous cycle ensues with
00:00:59.280 an increase of love between both the
00:01:01.520 giver and the receiver.
00:01:04.319 God's love is perfect, infinite,
00:01:07.600 enduring, and most sweet. It fills the
00:01:11.200 soul with exceedingly great joy.
00:01:14.479 Nevertheless, at times we may find it
00:01:17.439 difficult to recognize God's love in our
00:01:20.640 lives.
00:01:22.400 However, our perfectly loving heavenly
00:01:24.960 father so deeply desires for us to
00:01:28.560 experience his love that he speaketh
00:01:31.680 unto us according to our understanding.
00:01:35.520 He will express his love for us in ways
00:01:38.720 we individually can recognize.
00:01:42.880 We may experience God's love for us when
00:01:45.600 we observe the beauties of nature or
00:01:48.880 receive answers to prayers
00:01:51.600 or have thoughts come to our mind in the
00:01:53.920 very moment of need or experience sweet
00:01:57.439 moments of joy.
00:02:00.000 The greatest manifestation of Heavenly
00:02:02.159 Father's love for us that resonates with
00:02:05.680 both mind and heart is when he allowed
00:02:08.959 his beloved son to offer himself as the
00:02:11.760 atoning one.
00:02:14.000 Like the prodical son's elder brother,
00:02:17.120 our focus is often centered on
00:02:19.360 ourselves.
00:02:21.280 We are so consumed with seeking evidence
00:02:23.599 of God's love for us and we become
00:02:26.879 frustrated when we do not see it.
00:02:30.080 But the beautiful paradox is that the
00:02:32.560 more we are focused on showing our love
00:02:35.120 for God, the more easily we recognize
00:02:38.720 his love for us.
00:02:41.280 Perhaps this is why the Savior responded
00:02:43.680 to the question, which is the great
00:02:46.080 commandment with this simple and
00:02:48.879 important invitation,
00:02:51.120 thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
00:02:53.440 all thy heart, with all thy soul, and
00:02:56.480 with all thy mind.
00:02:59.120 Sometimes the way we show our love to
00:03:01.360 those we hold most dear is not
00:03:04.080 necessarily the way they recognize love.
00:03:07.680 This may be frustrating for both the
00:03:09.760 giver and the receiver.
00:03:12.480 It may be helpful to ask those we love
00:03:14.720 how they recognize love expressed.
00:03:18.239 Likewise, if we want to show our love
00:03:20.959 for God, we should understand how he
00:03:24.000 recognizes our love.
00:03:26.720 Fortunately, he has clearly outlined
00:03:28.959 several ways in the scriptures that we
00:03:31.760 can show our love for him.
00:03:34.640 In the instructive exchange between
00:03:36.959 Peter and the resurrected Lord at the
00:03:38.959 Sea of Tiberius, we learn of ways we can
00:03:41.519 show our love for the Lord.
00:03:44.159 Jesus saith to Simon, Peter, Simon, son
00:03:48.159 of Jonas, lovest thou me more than
00:03:51.120 these? He saith unto him, "Yay, Lord,
00:03:54.319 thou knowest that I love thee."
00:03:57.120 The key question in this inquiry by the
00:03:59.760 Lord is, "Lovest thou me more than
00:04:02.480 these?"
00:04:04.239 We show our love to the Lord when we put
00:04:07.280 him above these. And these can be
00:04:11.280 anyone,
00:04:12.799 any activity or anything that displaces
00:04:16.880 him from being the most important
00:04:18.880 influence in our lives.
00:04:21.519 There will never be enough time in a
00:04:23.600 day, a week, a month, or a year to get
00:04:28.400 done all we want or need to accomplish.
00:04:32.160 Part of the test of mortality is to use
00:04:34.720 the precious resource of time for what
00:04:37.919 is most important for our eternal good
00:04:40.720 and to let go of those things that are
00:04:42.960 less important.
00:04:45.199 President Russell M. Nelson said, "The
00:04:48.560 question for each of us is the same. Are
00:04:51.919 you willing to let God be the most
00:04:54.160 important influence in your life? Will
00:04:57.440 you allow his words, his commandments,
00:05:00.560 and his covenants to influence what you
00:05:03.280 do each day?
00:05:05.360 Will you allow his voice to take
00:05:07.600 priority over any other?
00:05:10.639 Are you willing to let whatever he needs
00:05:12.800 you to do take precedence over every
00:05:16.000 other ambition?
00:05:18.240 Are you willing to have your will
00:05:20.240 swallowed up in his?
00:05:23.039 We demonstrate our disciplehip and love
00:05:26.000 for God when we make him our top
00:05:28.720 priority.
00:05:30.800 In the next verse of this same
00:05:32.560 discussion between Peter and the Savior,
00:05:35.520 we learn of another way the Lord
00:05:37.520 recognizes our expressions of love.
00:05:40.880 The Lord said to him again the second
00:05:43.440 time,"Simon,
00:05:45.280 son of Jonas, lovest thou me?" He saith
00:05:49.440 unto him, "Yay, Lord, thou knowest that
00:05:51.360 I love thee." He saith unto him, "Feed
00:05:55.039 my sheep."
00:05:57.039 We show our love for Heavenly Father
00:05:59.280 when we serve, listen to, love, lift, or
00:06:04.240 minister to his children.
00:06:07.440 That service may be as simple as truly
00:06:10.880 seeing others without judgment.
00:06:14.160 In the 76th section of the Doctrine and
00:06:16.800 Covenants, we get a glimpse of the
00:06:19.280 character of those who will inherit a
00:06:21.520 celestial glory.
00:06:23.759 They see as they are seen and they know
00:06:26.720 as they are known. They see others as
00:06:30.560 God sees them and he sees them as they
00:06:33.680 can become with glorious divine
00:06:36.560 potential.
00:06:38.720 After returning home from my mission, I
00:06:40.960 took over the lawn care business my
00:06:42.880 brothers and I had started as teenagers.
00:06:45.759 I was also busy with my university
00:06:48.240 studies.
00:06:49.840 One spring week, heavy rains and looming
00:06:52.400 final exams left me overwhelmed and
00:06:55.360 behind on yard work. Midweek, the skies
00:06:58.800 cleared and I planned to catch up on
00:07:01.039 yard work after classes. But when I
00:07:03.680 arrived home, my truck and equipment
00:07:06.400 were gone. Curious, I visited the
00:07:09.520 scheduled yards. Each one had already
00:07:12.240 been beautifully trimmed. At the last
00:07:14.880 yard on the schedule, I saw my younger
00:07:17.280 brother walking behind the mower. He saw
00:07:20.240 me, smiled, and waved.
00:07:22.800 Overcome with gratitude, I hugged and
00:07:25.039 thanked him. His meaningful act of
00:07:27.759 service deeply strengthened my love and
00:07:30.479 loyalty for him. Serving each other is
00:07:33.759 an unmistakable way we show our love for
00:07:36.000 God and his beloved son.
00:07:39.440 We also manifest our love for God by
00:07:42.080 having a grateful heart. The Lord said,
00:07:45.360 "In nothing doth man offend God save
00:07:47.840 those who confess not his hand in all
00:07:50.319 things."
00:07:51.599 We show our love for God by
00:07:53.440 acknowledging him as the source of every
00:07:56.240 good thing in our lives.
00:07:58.879 In the early days of launching a
00:08:00.560 company, my business partner and I would
00:08:02.800 pray earnestly before important
00:08:04.560 meetings, asking for Heavenly Father's
00:08:07.440 help. Time after time, God answered our
00:08:10.879 prayers, and our meetings went well.
00:08:14.479 After one meeting, my business partner
00:08:16.879 pointed out that we had been quick to
00:08:18.800 ask for help, but slow to give thanks.
00:08:22.400 From then on, we made it a habit to
00:08:25.039 offer sincere prayers of gratitude,
00:08:27.840 recognizing the Lord's hand in our
00:08:29.680 successes.
00:08:31.199 We show our love for God with an
00:08:33.120 attitude of gratitude.
00:08:36.159 Another way we show our love for
00:08:37.679 Heavenly Father and his beloved son is
00:08:40.479 to choose to obey them.
00:08:43.519 The Savior said, "If you love me, keep
00:08:46.000 my commandments."
00:08:48.000 This kind of obedience is neither blind
00:08:50.800 nor compulsory, but is a sincere and
00:08:54.399 willing expression of love.
00:08:57.279 Father in heaven wants us to want to be
00:09:00.240 obedient.
00:09:02.240 Sister Tamara W. Roa called this
00:09:04.720 affectionate obedience.
00:09:06.959 She said, "Even though we don't have
00:09:09.440 perfect obedience yet, we try
00:09:12.320 affectionate obedience now, choosing to
00:09:15.839 stay again and again because we love
00:09:18.560 him."
00:09:20.399 Heavenly Father gave us agency to
00:09:23.120 inspire us to want to choose him. His
00:09:27.040 work and glory is not only to bring to
00:09:29.279 pass our eternal life but also includes
00:09:32.720 a hope that our greatest desire is to
00:09:36.320 return to him. However, he will never
00:09:39.279 force us to obey
00:09:41.760 in the hymn. Know this that every soul
00:09:43.760 is free. We sing he'll call, persuade,
00:09:48.560 direct a right and bless with wisdom,
00:09:51.760 love and light. In nameless ways, be
00:09:54.880 good and kind, but never force the human
00:09:58.000 mind. As mission leaders, my wife
00:10:00.880 Christine and I were inspired by so many
00:10:03.360 missionaries who chose to be obedient,
00:10:06.640 not only because it was a missionary
00:10:08.560 standard, but because they wanted to
00:10:11.200 show their love for the Lord by humbly
00:10:14.000 choosing to represent him.
00:10:17.279 Elder Dale G. Renland said, "Our
00:10:20.000 heavenly father's goal in parenting is
00:10:22.320 not to have his children do what is
00:10:24.240 right. It is to have his children choose
00:10:27.360 to do what is right and ultimately
00:10:30.399 become like him. If he simply wanted us
00:10:33.279 to be obedient, he would use immediate
00:10:36.079 rewards and punishment to influence our
00:10:38.560 behaviors. We show our love for God when
00:10:42.000 we choose to obey and follow him." Our
00:10:45.680 heavenly father and our savior recognize
00:10:48.720 our expressions of love for them when we
00:10:51.519 put them first in our lives, serve one
00:10:54.560 another, gratefully acknowledge every
00:10:57.279 blessing from them, and choose to obey
00:11:00.399 and follow them. I testify that each one
00:11:04.000 of us truly is a child of God and he
00:11:07.680 loves us perfectly.
00:11:09.839 I testify that he yearns for us to
00:11:12.640 experience his love in ways we recognize
00:11:15.440 and understand. And the beautiful
00:11:18.000 paradox is that we will experience his
00:11:20.720 love for us even more deeply as we show
00:11:23.920 our love for him in the name of Jesus
00:11:26.560 Christ. Amen.
00:11:28.320 Amen.
