00:00:00.800 In May 2021, while visiting the
00:00:03.760 renovation work of the Salake Temple,
00:00:06.560 President Russell M. Nelson marveled at
00:00:09.840 the efforts of the pioneers who with
00:00:12.320 limited resources and unwavering faith
00:00:15.599 built that sacred edifice, a physical
00:00:19.439 and spiritual masterpiece that has stood
00:00:22.320 the test of time.
00:00:24.480 However, he also observed the effects of
00:00:27.920 erosion which over time had caused gaps
00:00:31.199 in the temples original foundation
00:00:33.440 stones and instability in the msory.
00:00:37.600 Clear signs of the need for structural
00:00:40.399 reinforcement.
00:00:42.160 Our beloved prophet then taught us that
00:00:44.800 just as it was necessary to implement
00:00:47.680 major measures to strengthen the
00:00:50.239 foundation of the temple in order for it
00:00:53.120 to withstand the forces of nature. We
00:00:56.399 also need to take extraordinary measures
00:01:00.000 perhaps measures we we have never before
00:01:03.280 taken to strengthen our spiritual own
00:01:06.880 spiritual foundation in Jesus Christ.
00:01:10.320 In his memorable message, he left us
00:01:13.439 with two profound questions for personal
00:01:16.159 reflection.
00:01:18.400 How firm is your foundation?
00:01:21.360 And what reinforcements to your
00:01:23.439 testimony and understanding of the
00:01:25.439 gospel are needed?
00:01:28.159 The gospel of Jesus Christ provides us
00:01:31.280 with divinely inspired and effective
00:01:34.159 means to prevent the spiritual erosion
00:01:37.360 in our souls. powerfully reinforcing our
00:01:40.560 foundation and helping us avoid gaps in
00:01:43.520 our faith and instability in both our
00:01:46.560 testimony and our understanding of the
00:01:49.280 sacred truths of the gospel.
00:01:52.320 One particularly relevant principle for
00:01:54.799 achieving this purpose is found in
00:01:57.520 section 12 of the Doctrine and
00:01:59.280 Covenants. A revelation given through
00:02:02.000 the prophet Joseph Smith to Joseph
00:02:04.240 Knight, a righteous man who earnestly
00:02:07.840 sought to understand the Lord's will,
00:02:10.639 not for mere outward change, but to
00:02:13.920 stand unwavering in his disciplehip,
00:02:17.120 firm as the pillars of heaven. The Lord
00:02:20.879 declared,
00:02:22.400 "Behold, I speak unto you and also to
00:02:26.640 all those who have desires to bring
00:02:28.959 forth and establish this work. And no
00:02:32.720 one can assist in this work, except the
00:02:35.840 shall he shall be humble and full of
00:02:38.480 love, having faith, hope, and charity,
00:02:42.480 being temperate in all things,
00:02:44.959 whatsoever shall be entrusted to his
00:02:47.920 care.
00:02:50.239 The Savior's guidance recorded in this
00:02:52.560 sacred revelation reminds us that
00:02:55.360 temperance is an essential reinforcement
00:02:58.720 for a firm foundation in Jesus Christ.
00:03:01.920 It is one of the indispensable virtues
00:03:04.879 not only for those who have been called
00:03:06.800 to serve, but for all who have made
00:03:09.760 sacred covenants with the Lord and
00:03:12.319 accept to follow him faithfully.
00:03:16.000 Temperance harmonizes and strengthens
00:03:19.040 other Christlike attributes mentioned in
00:03:21.360 this revelation. Humility, faith, hope,
00:03:26.239 charity, and the pure love that flows
00:03:29.120 from him. Furthermore, cultivating
00:03:32.400 temperance is a meaningful way to
00:03:34.720 protect our souls against the subtle yet
00:03:38.400 constant spiritual erosion caused by
00:03:41.599 worldly influences that can weaken our
00:03:44.319 foundation in Jesus Christ.
00:03:47.360 Among the qualities that adorn through
00:03:49.680 disciples of Christ, temperance stands
00:03:52.799 out as a reflection of the savior
00:03:55.120 himself, a precious fruit of the spirit,
00:03:59.040 available to all who open themselves to
00:04:01.840 divine influence.
00:04:04.239 It is the virtue that brings harmony to
00:04:06.480 the heart, shaping desires and emotions
00:04:09.439 with wisdom and calmness.
00:04:12.239 In the scriptures, temperance is
00:04:14.879 presented as an essential part of the
00:04:17.440 progress in our spiritual journey,
00:04:20.399 leading us toward patience, godliness,
00:04:23.759 and compassion while refining our
00:04:26.720 feelings, our words, and our actions.
00:04:30.639 Disciples of Christ who strive to
00:04:32.960 cultivate this Christlike attribute
00:04:36.240 become increasingly humble and full of
00:04:38.800 love. A serene strength arises in them
00:04:43.199 and they become better capable of
00:04:45.199 restraining anger, nurturing patience
00:04:48.800 and treating others with tolerance,
00:04:51.120 respect and dignity. Even when the winds
00:04:54.800 of a diversity blow fiercely,
00:04:57.919 they strive not to act impulsively
00:05:01.040 but choose to act with spiritual wisdom
00:05:04.479 guided by meekness and the gentle
00:05:06.800 influence of the Holy Spirit. In this
00:05:10.000 way, they become less vulnerable to
00:05:13.199 spiritual erosion because as the Apostle
00:05:16.320 Paul taught,
00:05:18.880 they know that they can do all things
00:05:21.440 through Christ who strengthens them even
00:05:25.039 in the face of trials that could shake
00:05:27.360 their testimony of him.
00:05:30.080 In his epistle to Titus, Paul conveyed
00:05:33.600 sacred counsel regarding the
00:05:35.280 qualifications of those who desire to
00:05:38.240 represent the Savior and do his will
00:05:40.880 with faith and dedication.
00:05:43.360 He said they should be hospitable,
00:05:46.400 sober, just, and holy qualities that
00:05:50.560 clearly reflect the influence of
00:05:52.880 temperance.
00:05:54.560 However, Paul warned that they should be
00:05:58.240 not self-willed,
00:06:00.240 not soon angry, and no striker.
00:06:04.800 Such characteristics are contrary to the
00:06:07.520 mind of the Savior and hinder true
00:06:10.080 spiritual growth. In the scriptural
00:06:12.960 context, not self-willed is one who
00:06:17.520 refuses to act with arrogance and pride.
00:06:22.000 Not soon angry is one who avoids the
00:06:25.039 natural urge to become impatient and
00:06:27.360 irritated. And no striker refers to one
00:06:32.240 to one who rejects contention,
00:06:35.280 aggressive and harsh behavior verbally,
00:06:38.240 physically and emotionally.
00:06:40.639 As we strive to change our behavior with
00:06:43.039 faith and humility, we can be firmly
00:06:46.560 anchored to the solid rock of his grace
00:06:50.160 and become pure and polished instruments
00:06:53.520 in his holy hands. In reflecting on the
00:06:57.199 need to cultivate the virtue of
00:06:59.199 temperance, I am reminded of the words
00:07:01.919 of Hannah, the mother of the prophet
00:07:04.400 Samuel.
00:07:09.120 A woman
00:07:12.240 of remarkable faith who even after great
00:07:16.319 trials after offered a song of gratitude
00:07:20.240 to the Lord. She said, "Talk no more so
00:07:24.639 exceeding proudly, let not arrogancy
00:07:29.280 came come out of your mouth, for the
00:07:32.080 Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him
00:07:35.840 actions are weighed." Her song is more
00:07:39.599 than a prayer. It is a self-addressed
00:07:42.560 invitation to act with humility,
00:07:45.599 self-control, and moderation. Hannah
00:07:48.560 reminds us that true spiritual strength
00:07:51.360 is not expressed in impulsive reactions
00:07:54.319 or hotty words, but in temperate,
00:07:57.360 thoughtful attitudes aligned with the
00:08:00.240 Lord's wisdom. Often times the world
00:08:03.919 exalts behaviors born of aggressiveness,
00:08:07.199 arrogance, impatience, and
00:08:09.759 excessiveness.
00:08:11.520 Often justifying such attitudes by the
00:08:14.240 pressures of daily life and the
00:08:16.400 inclination toward validation and
00:08:18.960 popularity.
00:08:20.960 When we turn our gaze away from the
00:08:23.039 virtue of temperance and ignore the
00:08:25.599 gentle and moderating influence of the
00:08:27.680 Holy Spirit in our way of acting and
00:08:30.720 speaking, we easily fall into the
00:08:33.599 enemy's trap which inevitably leads us
00:08:37.599 to utter words and adopt attitudes we
00:08:41.760 will deeply regret. Whether in our
00:08:44.399 social family or even ecclesiastical
00:08:46.880 relationships,
00:08:48.720 the gospel of Jesus Christ invites us to
00:08:51.519 exercise this virtue, especially in
00:08:54.480 times of challenge. For it is precisely
00:08:57.680 on these occasions that the true
00:09:00.240 character of an individual is revealed.
00:09:04.160 As Martin Luther King Jr. once said,
00:09:08.080 "The ultimate measure of a man is not
00:09:11.120 where he stands in moments of comfort
00:09:13.279 and convenience, but where he stands at
00:09:16.959 times of challenge and controversy.
00:09:20.560 As covenant people, we are called to
00:09:23.200 live with our hearts firmly rooted in
00:09:25.600 the sacred promises we have made to the
00:09:28.480 Lord, carefully following the pattern he
00:09:31.440 established through his perfect example.
00:09:34.880 In return he has promised
00:09:38.080 verily verily I say unto you that this
00:09:41.360 is my doctrine and whose buth upon this
00:09:46.000 buildth upon my rock and the gates of
00:09:49.360 hell shall not prevail against them.
00:09:53.600 The Savior's ministry on earth was
00:09:56.320 marked by the virtue of temperance in
00:09:59.279 all aspects of his character.
00:10:02.640 Through his perfect example, he taught
00:10:05.200 us to be patient in afflictions. Revile
00:10:08.399 not against those that revile.
00:10:11.200 As he taught that we should not give in
00:10:14.240 to anger because of disputes and
00:10:16.640 contentions. He declared, "Ye must
00:10:19.680 repent and become as a little child."
00:10:23.440 He also taught that all who desire to
00:10:26.320 come unto him with full purpose of heart
00:10:29.920 must reconcile with those with whom they
00:10:32.880 are angry or with those who have
00:10:35.760 something against them.
00:10:38.560 With a temperate attitude and
00:10:40.399 compassionate heart, he assured us that
00:10:43.920 when we are treated with harshness,
00:10:46.560 unkindness, disrespect or disregard,
00:10:50.640 his kindness will not depart from us,
00:10:53.760 and the covenant of his peace shall not
00:10:56.720 be removed from our lives.
00:11:00.480 A few years ago,
00:11:02.800 my wife and I had the sacred privilege
00:11:05.200 of meeting with some faithful members of
00:11:07.440 the church in Mexico City.
00:11:10.880 Many of them, either personally or to
00:11:13.680 their loved ones, had endured
00:11:16.079 indescribable trials, including
00:11:18.959 kidnappings, homesides, and other
00:11:21.839 heartbreaking tragedies.
00:11:24.800 As we looked into the faces of those
00:11:27.279 saints, we did not see anger,
00:11:30.560 resentment, or a desire for revenge.
00:11:34.320 Instead, we saw a quiet humility.
00:11:38.959 Their countenances,
00:11:40.880 though marketked by sorrow, radiated a
00:11:44.160 sincere longing for healing and comfort.
00:11:48.079 Even though their hearts were broken by
00:11:50.560 suffering, these saints pressed forward
00:11:53.839 with faith in Jesus Christ, choosing not
00:11:56.800 to let their afflictions become gaps in
00:11:59.279 their faith or cause instability in
00:12:02.160 their testimony of the gospel. At the
00:12:05.360 conclusion of that sacred gathering, we
00:12:08.639 greeted each one of them.
00:12:12.399 Every handshake,
00:12:14.560 every embrace
00:12:16.399 became a quiet testimony that with the
00:12:19.360 help of the Lord, we can choose to
00:12:22.000 respond with temperance to the
00:12:24.399 frustrations and challenges of life.
00:12:27.440 Their quiet and unassuming example
00:12:30.880 served as a tender invitation to walk
00:12:33.360 the Savior's path with temperance in all
00:12:36.480 things. We felt as we were in the
00:12:40.399 presence of angels.
00:12:42.880 Jesus Christ, the greatest greatest of
00:12:45.680 all, suffered for us until he bled from
00:12:49.760 every pore. Yet he never allowed anger
00:12:53.360 to inflame his heart.
00:12:56.079 Not nor did aggressive, offensive, or
00:12:59.200 profane words escape his lips. Even amid
00:13:02.880 such affliction, with perfect temperance
00:13:06.079 and unmatched meekness, he did not think
00:13:08.959 of himself, but of of each of God's
00:13:12.800 children, past, present, and future. The
00:13:16.560 Apostle Peter testified of Christ's
00:13:18.800 sublime attitude when he declared,
00:13:22.000 "Who, when he was reviled, reviled not
00:13:25.519 again. When he suffered, he threatened
00:13:28.800 not, but committed himself to him that
00:13:32.079 judgeth righteously.
00:13:34.560 Even in the midst of the greatest agony,
00:13:37.680 the Savior demonstrated perfect and
00:13:39.920 divine temperance, he declared,
00:13:43.360 "Nevertheless, glory be to the Father,
00:13:46.320 and I parttook and finished my
00:13:48.320 preparations unto the children of men."
00:13:52.079 My beloved brothers and sisters, I
00:13:55.040 extend an earnest invitation to all of
00:13:57.600 us to adorn our minds and hearts with
00:14:00.959 the Christlike virtue of temperance as a
00:14:04.160 sacred response to the prophetic call of
00:14:07.440 our dear President Russell M. Nelson.
00:14:11.920 As we strive with faith and diligence to
00:14:15.360 weave temperance into our actions and
00:14:17.839 words, I testify that we will strengthen
00:14:20.880 and anchor our lives more securely upon
00:14:24.160 the sure foundation of our redeemer. I
00:14:27.199 solemnly bear my testimony that the
00:14:30.079 constant pursuit of temperance purifies
00:14:32.800 our soul and sanctifies our heart before
00:14:35.760 the Savior, gently drawing us nearer to
00:14:38.880 him and preparing us with hope and peace
00:14:42.560 for that glorious day when we shall meet
00:14:45.519 him at his second coming. I share these
00:14:48.800 sacred words in the name of our savior
00:14:51.680 Jesus Christ. Amen.
