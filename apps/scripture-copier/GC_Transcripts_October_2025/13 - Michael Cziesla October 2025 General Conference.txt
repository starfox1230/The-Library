00:00:01.920 33 years ago, I received my call to
00:00:04.400 serve as a missionary in the Utah Ogden
00:00:06.879 Mission. Of course, coming from Europe,
00:00:09.840 some local Utah traditions like green
00:00:12.880 jello with carrots and funeral potatoes
00:00:15.599 were a bit peculiar to me.
00:00:18.960 However, I was deeply impressed by the
00:00:20.800 devotion and disciplehip of many of the
00:00:22.880 saints, the sheer number of people
00:00:24.960 attending church meetings, and the scale
00:00:27.359 of fully functioning church programs.
00:00:30.160 When my mission came to an end, I wanted
00:00:32.399 to make sure that the joy I felt and the
00:00:35.040 spiritual strength and maturity I
00:00:36.800 observed would also be available for my
00:00:39.200 future family. I was determined to
00:00:41.680 return quickly to live my life in the
00:00:43.600 shadows of the everlasting hills.
00:00:46.559 However, the Lord had different plans.
00:00:48.879 On my first Sunday at home, my wife
00:00:50.960 bishop called me to serve as the young
00:00:52.719 man president, our ward. Serving this
00:00:55.360 wonderful group of young men, I quickly
00:00:57.199 learned that the joy that comes from
00:00:59.199 being a disciple of Christ has very
00:01:01.600 little to do with the size of church
00:01:03.280 meetings or the scale of programs.
00:01:06.560 So when I married my beautiful wife
00:01:08.240 Margaret, we joyfully decided to stay in
00:01:10.640 Europe and raise our family in our home
00:01:12.880 country of Germany. Together we witness
00:01:15.360 what President Russell Nelson taught
00:01:17.040 many years ago. The joy we feel has
00:01:20.000 little to do with the circumstances of
00:01:21.680 our lives and everything to do with the
00:01:24.479 focus of our lives. When the focus of
00:01:27.200 our life is on Christ and his gospel
00:01:29.439 message, we can experience the full
00:01:31.759 blessings of disciplehip wherever we
00:01:34.000 live.
00:01:35.680 However, in a world that's increasingly
00:01:37.680 secular, complex, and confusing with
00:01:40.320 different and often conflicting messages
00:01:42.240 and demands, how can we avoid our eyes
00:01:45.040 becoming blinded and our hearts becoming
00:01:47.520 hardened and remain focused on the plain
00:01:50.000 and precious things of the gospel of
00:01:52.000 Jesus Christ.
00:01:54.000 During a time of confusion, the Apostle
00:01:56.079 Paul gave great advice advice to the
00:01:58.399 saints of Corinth by reminding them to
00:02:00.880 focus on the simplicity that is in
00:02:03.280 Christ.
00:02:04.880 The doctrine of Christ and the law of
00:02:06.640 the gospel are so simple that even
00:02:08.800 little children can understand them. We
00:02:11.520 can access the redeeming power of Jesus
00:02:13.599 Christ and receive all spiritual
00:02:15.280 blessings our heavenly father has
00:02:16.879 prepared for us by exercising faith in
00:02:19.360 Jesus Christ, repenting, being baptized,
00:02:22.480 being sanctified through the gift of the
00:02:24.239 Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.
00:02:27.200 President Nelson has described this
00:02:28.800 journey so beautifully as the covenant
00:02:30.560 path and the process of becoming a
00:02:33.040 devout disciple of Jesus Christ.
00:02:35.920 If this message is so simple, why does
00:02:38.640 often feel so challenging to live
00:02:40.319 Christ's law and follow his example? It
00:02:43.040 may be that we misinterpret simplicity
00:02:45.040 as something that is easy to achieve
00:02:47.120 without without effort or diligence.
00:02:49.840 Following Christ's law requires constant
00:02:52.000 effort and continual change. We need to
00:02:54.800 put off the natural man and become like
00:02:56.800 a little child. This includes putting
00:02:59.440 our trust in the Lord and letting the
00:03:01.599 complexity go just as little children
00:03:04.159 do. Applying the doctrine of Christ in
00:03:07.519 simplified and focused way will help us
00:03:10.000 to find find joy in our daily lives,
00:03:12.640 give guidance in our callings, answer
00:03:15.200 some of life's most complex questions,
00:03:17.760 and provide strength to face our
00:03:19.599 greatest challenges.
00:03:21.680 But how can we practically implement
00:03:23.680 this simplicity in our lifelong journey
00:03:25.920 as disciple of Christ? President Nelson
00:03:28.720 reminded us to focus on pure truth, pure
00:03:32.000 doctrine, and pure revelation as we seek
00:03:34.720 to follow the Savior.
00:03:37.040 Regularly asking, "What would the Lord
00:03:39.599 Jesus Christ have me do?" reveals
00:03:41.840 profound direction.
00:03:43.920 Following his example provides a safe
00:03:45.840 path through uncertainty and a loving
00:03:48.560 guiding hand to hold from day to day. He
00:03:52.159 is the prince of peace and the good
00:03:54.239 shepherd. He is our comforter and
00:03:56.720 deliverer. He is our rock and refuge. He
00:04:00.560 is a friend, your friend, and my friend.
00:04:04.879 He invites us all to love God, keep his
00:04:07.360 commandments, and love our neighbor.
00:04:10.560 As we choose to follow his example and
00:04:12.720 move forward with faith in Christ,
00:04:14.640 embrace the power of his atonement, and
00:04:16.560 remember our covenants, love fills our
00:04:19.040 heart, hope and healing raise our
00:04:21.199 spirits, and bitterness and sorrow are
00:04:23.520 replaced by gratitude and the patience
00:04:25.440 to wait for promised blessings. At
00:04:28.000 times, we may need to distance ourselves
00:04:29.840 from an unhealthy situation or seek
00:04:31.680 professional help. But in every case,
00:04:34.080 applying simple gospel principles will
00:04:36.080 help us navigate through life's
00:04:37.600 challenges in the Lord's way. We
00:04:40.560 sometimes underestimate the strength we
00:04:42.720 receive from simple acts like prayer,
00:04:45.040 fasting, scripture study, daily
00:04:47.040 repentance, partaking of the sacrament
00:04:49.280 weekly, and regular temple attendance.
00:04:51.680 But when we recognize that we don't need
00:04:53.759 to do some great thing and we center
00:04:55.919 ourselves on applying pure and simple
00:04:58.000 doctrine, we start to see how the gospel
00:05:00.720 works wonderfully for us even in the
00:05:02.880 most challenging circumstances. We've
00:05:05.280 had strength and confidence before God
00:05:07.520 even when we experience heartache. Elder
00:05:10.000 M. Russell Embell has reminded us many
00:05:12.080 times it is in that simplicity that we
00:05:14.960 will find peace, joy and happiness.
00:05:18.320 Applying the simplicity that is in
00:05:20.000 Christ makes us prioritize people over
00:05:22.560 processes, eternal relationships over
00:05:25.520 short-term behaviors. We focus on the
00:05:28.320 things that matter most in God's work of
00:05:30.160 salvation and exaltation instead of
00:05:32.320 getting caught up in managing our
00:05:34.080 ministering. We pri we make ourselves
00:05:36.880 free to prioritize the things we can do
00:05:39.440 rather than being weighed down by the
00:05:40.880 things we cannot do. The Lord reminded
00:05:43.520 us, "Wherefore be not weary and
00:05:45.440 welloing, for you are laying the
00:05:46.960 foundation of a great work, and out of
00:05:49.199 that out of small things proceeded that
00:05:51.440 which is great." What powerful
00:05:53.759 encouragement to act in simplicity and
00:05:55.919 humility, whatever our circumstances
00:05:58.400 are.
00:06:00.160 My grandmother, Matisla, the woman on
00:06:03.120 the right in this picture, was a
00:06:04.880 wonderful example of doing small and
00:06:06.800 simple things to bring great things to
00:06:08.400 pass. We lovingly called her Omar Cisla.
00:06:12.080 Omar embraced the gospel in the small
00:06:13.840 village of Zelbongan in East Persia
00:06:15.680 together with my great grandmother on
00:06:17.759 May 30th, 1926.
00:06:20.319 She loved the Lord and his gospel and
00:06:22.560 was determined to keep the covenant she
00:06:24.479 had made. In 1930, she married my
00:06:27.360 grandfather who was not a member of the
00:06:29.360 church. At this point, it became
00:06:31.360 impossible for Omar to attend church
00:06:33.120 meetings because my grandfather's farm
00:06:35.360 was many hours away from the nearest
00:06:37.039 congregation.
00:06:38.639 But she focused on what she could do.
00:06:40.960 Omar continued to pray, read the
00:06:42.960 scriptures, and sing the songs of Zion.
00:06:45.759 Some people might have thought she was
00:06:47.360 no longer active in her faith, but that
00:06:49.600 was far from the truth. When my aunt and
00:06:52.479 my father were born with no priesthood
00:06:54.319 in the home and no church meetings or
00:06:55.919 access to ordinances nearby, she again
00:06:58.560 did what she could do and focused on
00:07:00.560 teaching her children to pray and to
00:07:02.880 walk uprightly before the Lord. She read
00:07:05.680 to them from the scriptures, sang with
00:07:07.840 them the songs of Zion, and of course
00:07:10.000 prayed with them every day, a 100%
00:07:13.520 home-c centered church experience.
00:07:16.240 In 1945, my grandfather was serving in
00:07:18.960 the war far away from home. When enemies
00:07:21.680 approached their farm, Omar took her two
00:07:24.000 little children and left their beloved
00:07:25.680 farm behind to seek refuge in a safer
00:07:27.919 place. After a difficult and
00:07:30.160 life-threatening journey, they finally
00:07:32.160 found refuge in May of 1945 in northern
00:07:34.960 Germany. They had nothing left except
00:07:37.440 the clothes on their bodies. But Omar
00:07:40.000 continued with what she was able to do.
00:07:42.400 She prayed with her children every day.
00:07:44.880 She sang with them the songs of Zion she
00:07:46.960 had memorized by heart every day. Life
00:07:50.479 was extremely hard and for many years
00:07:52.479 focused on simply making sure there was
00:07:54.800 food on the table. But in 1955, my dad,
00:07:58.400 then 17 years old, was going to trade
00:08:00.560 school in the city of Grenborg. He
00:08:02.960 walked by a building and saw a small
00:08:04.560 sign on the outside that reading,
00:08:09.360 church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
00:08:11.360 Saints. He thought, "That's interesting.
00:08:14.319 This is mother's church." So when he
00:08:16.560 came home, he told that he had found her
00:08:18.960 church. You can imagine how she must
00:08:21.599 have felt after almost 25 years of no
00:08:24.160 contact with the church. She was
00:08:26.400 determined to attend the next Sunday and
00:08:28.400 convinced my father to accompany her.
00:08:30.879 Rensborg was more than 20 miles away
00:08:32.958 from the little village where they
00:08:34.240 lived. But this would not keep from
00:08:36.719 attending church. The next Sunday, she
00:08:39.120 got on her bicycle together with my
00:08:40.958 father and rode to church.
00:08:43.599 When the sacrament meeting started, my
00:08:45.600 dad sat down in the last row, hoping it
00:08:48.320 would be over soon. This was church and
00:08:51.760 not his. What he saw was not very
00:08:54.240 encouraging. Only a few older women in
00:08:56.959 attendance and two young missionaries
00:08:58.880 who effectively ran everything in the
00:09:01.360 meeting. But then they started to sing
00:09:04.880 and they sang the songs of Zion that my
00:09:07.600 dad had heard since he was a little boy.
00:09:10.560 Come, come, you saints. Oh my father,
00:09:14.080 praise to the man.
00:09:16.320 Hearing this little flock sing the songs
00:09:18.320 of Zine he'd known since childhood
00:09:20.720 pierced his heart and he knew
00:09:22.640 immediately and without a doubt that the
00:09:25.040 church was true. The first sacum meeting
00:09:28.000 my grandmother attended after 25 years
00:09:30.800 was the meeting where my father received
00:09:32.640 a personal confirmation of the
00:09:34.640 truthfulness of the restored gospel of
00:09:36.480 Jesus Christ. He was baptized three
00:09:39.200 weeks later on September 25th, 1955
00:09:43.120 together with my grandfather and my
00:09:45.040 aunt.
00:09:47.279 It has been more than 70 years since
00:09:48.959 that tiny sacum meeting in Rensborg. I
00:09:51.920 often think about Oba, how she must have
00:09:54.320 felt in those lonely nights doing the
00:09:56.640 small and simple things she was able to
00:09:58.720 do like praying, reading and singing. As
00:10:02.480 I stand here today in general conference
00:10:04.399 and talk about my um her determination
00:10:07.120 to keep her covenants and trust in the
00:10:09.360 Lord notwithstanding her struggles fills
00:10:11.839 my heart with humility and grat
00:10:13.600 gratitude not only for her but for so
00:10:16.160 many of our wonderful saints throughout
00:10:17.920 the world who focus on the simplicity in
00:10:20.399 Christ in their challenging
00:10:21.600 circumstances. Perhaps seeing little
00:10:23.680 change now but trusting that great
00:10:25.920 things will come to pass someday in the
00:10:27.760 future.
00:10:29.519 I have learned through my own experience
00:10:31.760 that the small and simple things of the
00:10:33.920 gospel and faithfully focusing on Christ
00:10:36.560 lead us to true joy bring about mighty
00:10:39.040 miracles and grant us confidence that
00:10:41.440 all promised blessings will come to
00:10:43.040 pass. This is as true for you as it is
00:10:46.640 true for me. In the words of Elder
00:10:48.959 Jeffrey R. Holland, "Some blessings come
00:10:51.200 soon, some come late, and some don't
00:10:53.680 come until heaven. But for those who
00:10:56.160 embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, they
00:10:58.000 come. Of this I also testify in the name
00:11:01.680 of Jesus Christ. Amen.
