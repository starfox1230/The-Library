00:00:00.800 A little over a year ago, I was released
00:00:03.520 from my assignment in the presence of
00:00:05.120 the 70. A change announced here at the
00:00:08.400 general conference because my name was
00:00:10.960 uh read near those of general
00:00:12.639 authorities becoming marriages. Many
00:00:14.880 assumed I was also finished my time of
00:00:17.039 service.
00:00:18.800 After the conference, I received
00:00:20.240 numerous messages of gratitude and good
00:00:22.640 wishes for my next phase in life. Some
00:00:25.840 even offered to buy my house in North
00:00:27.599 South Lake.
00:00:30.640 It was nice to see that I would not uh I
00:00:32.880 would be missed and also to know we will
00:00:35.280 not have trouble selling our home when
00:00:37.360 I'm done. But I'm not there yet.
00:00:41.440 My new assignment took Monik and me to
00:00:43.680 beautiful Africa where the church is
00:00:46.239 flourishing. Has been a blessing to
00:00:48.640 serve among the faithful saints in the
00:00:50.480 Africa South area and witness the Lord
00:00:53.840 Lord's love for them. It is inspiring to
00:00:56.800 see generational families of all
00:00:58.960 backgrounds, including many successful
00:01:01.600 and well educated church members
00:01:04.319 dedicating their time and talents to
00:01:06.320 serve others.
00:01:08.720 At the same time, given the region's
00:01:10.560 demographics, many people of modest
00:01:12.720 means are joining the church and
00:01:14.479 transforming their lives through the
00:01:16.479 blessings of tithing faithfulness and
00:01:18.880 the educational opportunities offered by
00:01:20.960 the church.
00:01:22.799 Programs such as succeeding school,
00:01:25.520 English connect, BYU pathway, and the
00:01:27.759 perpetual educational fund blessed many
00:01:30.000 lives, especially those of the rising
00:01:32.479 generation.
00:01:34.240 President Fost James is Fa once stated,
00:01:38.159 it has been said that this church does
00:01:40.400 not necessarily attract great people,
00:01:43.200 but more often makes ordinary people
00:01:45.600 great.
00:01:47.360 The greatness of our of uh our uh the
00:01:50.479 greatness of our sense in Africa becomes
00:01:52.720 even more evident as they face life's
00:01:55.439 challenges and the demands of a growing
00:01:57.680 church. They always approach it with a
00:02:00.880 positive attitude. They embody uh well
00:02:04.240 the well-known teaching from from
00:02:05.759 President Nelson. The joy we feel has
00:02:08.878 little to do with the circumstances of
00:02:10.800 our lives and everything to do with the
00:02:12.800 focus of our lives. When the focus of
00:02:15.599 our lives is in God's plan of salvation
00:02:18.720 and Jesus Christ and his gospel, we can
00:02:22.080 feel joy regardless of what is happening
00:02:25.440 or not happening in our lives.
00:02:29.440 They find joy despite their challenges.
00:02:32.560 They have learned that our relationship
00:02:35.440 with the savior enables to approach
00:02:37.760 difficulties with his smiling faces and
00:02:41.040 grateful hearts. Let me share some of my
00:02:44.319 experiences with these faithful saints
00:02:46.800 who illustrate this principle. Starting
00:02:49.440 with Mosambique.
00:02:52.160 A few months ago, I presided over a
00:02:54.000 state conference for a one-year old
00:02:56.319 stake that already had 10 units. More
00:02:59.519 than 2,000 people filled the small
00:03:01.599 chapel and three tents that were set out
00:03:04.400 outside. The stake president is 31 years
00:03:08.159 old, his wife 26, and they have two
00:03:12.239 small children. And he leads this
00:03:14.560 growing and challenging stake with no
00:03:17.680 complaints, only a smiling face and a
00:03:21.200 grateful heart.
00:03:23.120 In an interview with the patriarch, I
00:03:25.519 learned that his wife was seriously
00:03:27.200 seriously ill and he struggled to
00:03:30.080 provide for her care. After addressing
00:03:32.959 the issue with the stake president, we
00:03:35.200 gave her gave her a priesthood blessing.
00:03:38.000 I inquired of the patriarch how many
00:03:40.000 patriarchal blessings he gives on
00:03:42.319 average? 8 to 10, he said. Uh I replied
00:03:47.680 per month and he said per week. I counel
00:03:52.000 him that doing that many per weekend was
00:03:54.239 not wise. Ed Godoy, he said, "They keep
00:03:57.519 coming every week, including new members
00:04:00.080 and many youth." And again, no
00:04:03.360 complaints, only a smiley face and a
00:04:06.720 grateful heart. After the Sunday evening
00:04:09.840 session of state conference, on my way
00:04:12.560 to the hotel, I noticed people buying
00:04:14.720 food along the road late at night. I
00:04:18.720 asked my driver why they are doing it
00:04:21.279 when it is so dark rather than during
00:04:23.759 the day. He responded that they were
00:04:26.960 working during the day to have the money
00:04:29.120 to do it later. Oh, they were working
00:04:33.199 today to eat tomorrow. I said, but he
00:04:36.400 corrected me. No, they were working
00:04:39.040 during the day to eat tonight.
00:04:43.440 I had hoped our members might be in a
00:04:46.960 better situation, but he confirmed that
00:04:50.000 many faced similar challenges in that
00:04:52.400 part of the country.
00:04:54.720 The next morning during our Sunday
00:04:57.199 session and nearly newly aware of their
00:05:00.400 circumstances, I was even more moved by
00:05:04.000 their smiley faces
00:05:06.880 and grateful hearts. Zambian
00:05:11.280 on the way to the Sunday meeting, the
00:05:13.440 stake president and I saw a couple
00:05:16.320 walking along the road with a baby and
00:05:18.960 two small children. We stopped to offer
00:05:21.600 them a ride.
00:05:23.440 They were surprised and delighted. When
00:05:26.080 I asked how far they needed to walk to
00:05:28.720 the chapel, the father replied that it
00:05:31.600 could take 45 minutes to an hour
00:05:34.720 depending on the children's face.
00:05:38.000 They faced this uh journey back and
00:05:40.560 forth every Sunday with no complaints,
00:05:44.560 only smiling faces and grateful hearts.
00:05:49.280 Malawi.
00:05:51.840 One Sunday before a state conference, I
00:05:54.240 visited two branches using uh public
00:05:57.680 schools as meeting houses. I was shocked
00:06:01.600 by the humble and modest conditions of
00:06:04.000 the buildings which lacked even some
00:06:06.560 basic amenities.
00:06:08.639 As I met a few members there, I was
00:06:11.440 ready to apologize for the inadequate
00:06:14.000 conditions of their meeting house, but
00:06:16.720 they were happy to have a nearby place
00:06:19.440 together, avoiding the usual long walk.
00:06:23.360 And again, there were no complaints,
00:06:26.319 only smiling faces and grateful hearts.
00:06:30.800 Zimbabwe.
00:06:33.440 Following a Saturday leadership
00:06:35.039 training, the stake president took me to
00:06:37.440 Sunday services held in a rented house.
00:06:41.440 There were 240 people in attendance.
00:06:45.280 Then the bishop introduced 10 new
00:06:48.400 members baptized that week.
00:06:51.199 The congregation was spread across
00:06:53.520 across two small rooms with some members
00:06:56.880 also sitting outside the building
00:07:00.160 watching the meeting through windows and
00:07:02.639 doors
00:07:04.880 and there were no complaints
00:07:07.599 only smiling faces and grateful hearts.
00:07:12.319 Lutu.
00:07:14.479 I visited this beautiful small country
00:07:17.039 also known as the mountain kingdom to
00:07:20.000 see a church district preparing to
00:07:21.919 become a stake.
00:07:24.000 Following a Saturday of meetings, I
00:07:26.160 attended Sunday services in one of their
00:07:29.440 branches in a rented house. The
00:07:32.400 sacramental room was overflowing with
00:07:35.520 people standing outside the door to
00:07:37.759 participate.
00:07:39.759 I told the branch president that he
00:07:41.520 needed a bigger house. To my surprise,
00:07:45.360 he informed me that this was only half
00:07:49.520 of his membership. The other half would
00:07:52.960 attend a second sacrament meeting after
00:07:56.319 the second hour. And again, there were
00:07:59.680 no complaints, only smiling faces and
00:08:03.120 grateful hearts.
00:08:05.759 I returned to Lutu later due to a fatal
00:08:09.520 the fatal traffic accident involving
00:08:11.680 several of our youth already mentioned
00:08:13.440 by other Christopherson
00:08:15.759 earlier. When I visited these families,
00:08:18.720 the families and leaders, I expected a
00:08:21.280 somber atmosphere. Instead, I
00:08:24.639 encountered strong and resilient saints
00:08:27.520 who were coping with the situation in an
00:08:30.479 uplifting and inspiring way. Nfu Anishia
00:08:35.120 Nunu 14 a surviving accident victim in
00:08:40.159 this picture illustrated it well in her
00:08:43.519 own words.
00:08:45.760 Trust in Jesus and always look unto him
00:08:50.000 because through him you will find peace
00:08:53.120 and he will help you in the healing
00:08:56.240 process.
00:08:58.240 These are just a few examples where we
00:09:00.800 see their positive attitude because they
00:09:04.000 center their lives in the gospel of
00:09:06.640 Jesus Christ. They know where to find
00:09:09.600 help and hope.
00:09:12.160 Why can the savior sucker them and us in
00:09:14.640 any circumstances of our lives? The
00:09:17.120 answer can be found in the scriptures.
00:09:19.440 and he shall go forth suffering pains
00:09:22.000 and afflictions and temptations of every
00:09:24.240 kind and he will take upon him their
00:09:26.720 infirmities that his brows may be filled
00:09:28.959 with mercy that he may know where to
00:09:31.440 sucker his people according to their
00:09:33.120 infirmities. As Elder Bedner taught,
00:09:36.399 there is no physical pain, anguish or
00:09:39.440 weakness we can experience that the
00:09:42.320 Savior does not know. You and I in a
00:09:45.839 moment of wicked wicked weakness may cry
00:09:48.320 out. No one understands what I'm going
00:09:51.920 through. No human being perhaps knows
00:09:55.200 but the son of God perfectly knows and
00:09:57.839 understand. And why? Because he felt and
00:10:01.760 bore our burdens before we ever did. I
00:10:04.640 conclude with my testimony of Christ's
00:10:06.800 words found in Matthew 11. Come unto me
00:10:10.560 all that labor and are heavy laden, and
00:10:13.760 I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon
00:10:16.320 you, and learn of me, for I meek and
00:10:19.279 lowly in heart, and you shall find rest
00:10:22.240 unto your souls. For my yoke is easy,
00:10:25.040 and my burden is light. Just like those
00:10:28.320 saints in Africa, I know this promise is
00:10:30.959 true. It is true there, and it is true
00:10:33.519 everywhere. Of this I testify in the
00:10:36.320 name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
