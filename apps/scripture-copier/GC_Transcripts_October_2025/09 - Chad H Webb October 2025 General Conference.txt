00:00:01.920 A story is told of a young university
00:00:04.000 student who struggled with a challenging
00:00:06.000 class. So, he hired a tutor to help him.
00:00:09.599 Near the end of the course, the
00:00:11.040 professor announced that students could
00:00:13.040 bring to the final exam one piece of
00:00:15.360 paper on which they could place anything
00:00:17.359 they wanted. Some students prepared by
00:00:20.160 making tiny notes with information from
00:00:22.640 lectures and textbooks, readable only by
00:00:25.519 using a magnifying glass. But the young
00:00:28.480 man arrived at the final exam with a
00:00:30.400 blank sheet of paper and a stranger.
00:00:33.120 When the professor questioned him, the
00:00:34.960 young man replied, "You said I could
00:00:37.200 bring one piece of paper with anything
00:00:39.280 on it." He then placed the paper on the
00:00:42.239 floor next to his desk and said, "I'd
00:00:44.879 like my tutor to stand on my piece of
00:00:46.879 paper."
00:00:50.160 As members of the Church of Jesus Christ
00:00:52.800 of Latter-day Saints, blessed with the
00:00:54.800 companionship of a member of the
00:00:56.879 Godhead,
00:00:58.480 we can have the help of the perfect
00:01:00.399 tutor. The Holy Ghost knows all things,
00:01:03.600 testifies of truth, and will bring all
00:01:05.760 things to our remembrance. President
00:01:08.240 Russell M. Nelson frequently spoke about
00:01:10.320 the importance of hearing the voice of
00:01:12.240 the Lord. He taught us how to invite the
00:01:14.960 guidance of the Holy Ghost and
00:01:16.400 repeatedly pled with us to increase our
00:01:19.200 spiritual capacity to receive
00:01:21.520 revelation.
00:01:23.119 Today, I invite you to consider the role
00:01:24.880 of the Holy Ghost, specifically related
00:01:27.040 to gospel learning and teaching in the
00:01:29.200 home and at church. The Holy Ghost is
00:01:31.920 given by the prayer of faith. And as we
00:01:34.159 strive to live worthy of this precious
00:01:36.159 gift, the inspired church manual,
00:01:38.640 teaching in the Savior's way, outlines
00:01:40.880 additional principles the Lord has
00:01:42.720 established that will help invite the
00:01:45.360 influence of the Holy Ghost. One of
00:01:48.079 these principles is invite diligent
00:01:50.479 learning. In the past, we may have
00:01:53.200 thought of teaching as a chance for a
00:01:55.200 parent or teacher to invite the spirit
00:01:57.920 into their own preparation
00:02:00.640 and then share what they have learned
00:02:02.320 with children or class members whose
00:02:04.399 role it has been to listen.
00:02:07.360 But even more effective is when we as
00:02:09.919 learners also come prepared and when
00:02:13.280 teachers create learning experiences
00:02:15.120 that foster personal revelation directly
00:02:17.680 to our hearts and minds.
00:02:20.800 Then, as we're given opportunities to
00:02:22.560 share what we are learning through our
00:02:24.239 study and from the Holy Ghost, we help
00:02:27.440 each other to be instructed and edified.
00:02:31.280 As we apply gospel principles, the
00:02:33.360 Spirit again bears witness of their
00:02:35.280 truthfulness.
00:02:37.280 As in all things, Jesus Christ is the
00:02:39.680 perfect example. He has invited each of
00:02:41.840 us to be diligent learners and to take
00:02:44.480 charge of our own testimonies. He
00:02:47.040 invited his disciples to prepare to
00:02:49.120 learn, to share what they were learning,
00:02:51.280 and to act in faith. He prayed for them,
00:02:54.800 saw their divine potential, listened to
00:02:57.120 them, and helped them know they were
00:02:59.200 loved and needed. As teachers, we can
00:03:02.159 for focus more on on the learner's
00:03:05.599 progress, on meeting their needs, and on
00:03:08.000 helping them to develop spiritual habits
00:03:10.080 of lifelong disciplehip.
00:03:12.720 As learners, when we exercise our agency
00:03:15.120 in the learning process, we signal to
00:03:17.120 the Holy Ghost our willingness to be
00:03:19.760 taught by him. I'm grateful for a
00:03:22.560 teacher who invited me to be a better
00:03:24.239 learner.
00:03:26.159 When I began college, I mistakenly
00:03:28.080 thought of school as something to endure
00:03:29.840 in order to be allowed to play sports.
00:03:32.319 One day, after reading a paper I had
00:03:34.000 written, my professor told me she
00:03:35.599 thought I was a gifted analytical
00:03:37.440 thinker. I didn't even know what that
00:03:39.280 meant.
00:03:40.720 She said that with more focused effort I
00:03:42.879 could be a good student. That thought
00:03:44.799 had never crossed my mind. Her interest,
00:03:48.400 encouragement,
00:03:50.879 and invitations
00:03:53.840 changed the course of my education and
00:03:56.480 greatly blessed my life. Another
00:03:59.599 principle relevant to inviting the Holy
00:04:01.599 Ghost is to teach true doctrine. This
00:04:04.720 means that our gospel study and
00:04:06.959 instruction is rooted in the word of God
00:04:09.439 and that we don't sensationalize or
00:04:11.439 speculate on what the Lord has not
00:04:13.120 revealed. Instead, we focus on essential
00:04:16.160 and eternal gospel principles which
00:04:18.160 allows the spirit to testify of truth.
00:04:21.519 Again, we follow the example of the
00:04:23.280 Savior. He said, "My doctrine is not
00:04:25.600 mine, but his that sent me." True
00:04:29.199 doctrine is found in the scriptures and
00:04:30.960 teachings of modern prophets. The Lord's
00:04:33.600 exhortation to study the scriptures
00:04:35.360 individually and as families and to
00:04:38.320 attend church each week to study his
00:04:40.560 gospel provides a remarkable framework
00:04:43.440 to learn his doctrine and hear his
00:04:45.680 voice. We search the scriptures to
00:04:48.320 understand the narrative, the principles
00:04:50.240 they teach, and the application of these
00:04:52.560 truths in our lives. What a blessing it
00:04:55.440 is to have the scriptures at our
00:04:56.960 fingertips. Imagine Adam and Eve,
00:04:59.680 Abinadi, or even the master teacher,
00:05:01.919 Jesus Christ, visiting our homes or
00:05:04.080 classes to teach us. They can when we
00:05:07.440 feast on the word of God. With
00:05:10.240 consistent effort, we can learn to
00:05:11.840 understand and love the scriptures and
00:05:14.240 trust that they have the answers to the
00:05:16.240 questions of the soul. There was a time
00:05:19.199 before we were married when my wife
00:05:20.720 Christy was struggling to feel Heavenly
00:05:22.560 Father's love and to understand his plan
00:05:24.720 for her. As she prayed for guidance, an
00:05:27.440 impression came that she should attend
00:05:29.360 institutes. So, she enrolled in a New
00:05:31.440 Testament class. The way her institute
00:05:34.400 teacher taught from the scriptures,
00:05:37.039 even the way he held them, showed how
00:05:39.680 much he loved the word of God. As she
00:05:42.479 attended, the Holy Ghost whispered to
00:05:44.320 her that there was something in the
00:05:47.120 scriptures that she needed. Her
00:05:50.240 teacher's love for the scriptures and
00:05:51.840 the prompings of the Holy Ghost gave her
00:05:54.000 a desire to begin a serious study of the
00:05:56.639 word of God, which became a lifelong
00:05:59.440 journey of deep conversion and
00:06:01.440 consecrated service.
00:06:04.080 Finally, as teaching in the Savior's way
00:06:07.520 suggests, our teaching and learning
00:06:09.360 should always focus on Jesus Christ. We
00:06:12.960 can speak more often and more reverently
00:06:15.039 of him and seek more opportunities to
00:06:17.840 express testimony, gratitude, and love
00:06:20.479 for him. Whatever the setting, as we
00:06:23.680 remember him, we can have his spirit to
00:06:26.240 be with us. One way to place Jesus
00:06:29.199 Christ at the center of our teaching is
00:06:31.039 to emphasize that he is the perfect
00:06:33.280 example, the embodiment and expression
00:06:36.080 of all gospel principles. Even when he
00:06:39.440 is not directly referred to in a
00:06:41.199 scriptural account, we can still point
00:06:43.600 to him as the example of the principle
00:06:45.919 being taught. We might simply ask, can
00:06:48.880 you think of a time when Jesus Christ
00:06:51.759 exemplified this principle?
00:06:54.479 We can also focus on him by learning of
00:06:56.639 his titles, roles, and attributes.
00:06:59.360 Seeking to learn not only what he has
00:07:01.280 done, but better understand who he is.
00:07:04.720 For example, when studying the principle
00:07:06.800 of repentance, it's important to
00:07:09.120 understand how to repent. But it's also
00:07:12.080 essential to remember what Jesus Christ
00:07:14.319 has done to make repentance possible and
00:07:17.520 to understand what repentance teaches us
00:07:19.919 about him, about his true nature and
00:07:23.199 characteristics.
00:07:25.039 What does our opportunity to repent say
00:07:27.360 about his love, patience, and mercy? his
00:07:30.880 belief in our divine potential, his
00:07:33.360 willingness to atone for our sins, and
00:07:35.360 the joy he finds in forgiving. And
00:07:38.479 understanding his titles such as lamb of
00:07:41.360 God, redeemer, and physician helps us
00:07:44.240 see that repentance is his invitation to
00:07:47.520 cleanse, change, and heal us. Focusing
00:07:51.280 on what he has done for us and what it
00:07:53.360 says about who he is can help us have
00:07:56.720 faith unto repentance.
00:07:59.520 At times we may not immediately see the
00:08:01.520 attributes of the Savior outlined in a
00:08:03.520 scriptural account. For example, when
00:08:06.000 reading when reading about Nephi
00:08:07.919 building a boat, we might focus only on
00:08:10.319 Nephi. But focusing on the Savior can
00:08:13.440 help us see that this record was not
00:08:15.520 preserved to teach us about the
00:08:17.680 greatness of Nephi, but to show us the
00:08:20.479 greatness of God. That he gives us
00:08:22.960 strength to keep his commandments and
00:08:25.840 delivers us in times of need.
00:08:28.879 We can also focus on Jesus Christ's
00:08:31.280 central role in Heavenly Father's
00:08:33.120 perfect plan of happiness.
00:08:36.320 It can change the course of our lives to
00:08:38.479 see our circumstances through the lens
00:08:40.479 of God's eternal plan. Instead of seeing
00:08:43.360 the plan through the lens of our
00:08:44.880 temporal circumstances,
00:08:47.040 the gospel is not a list of demands.
00:08:49.440 It's the good news that Jesus Christ
00:08:51.760 overcame sin and death. It's by
00:08:54.720 accessing his amazing grace through
00:08:56.640 keeping our covenants with God that we
00:08:59.360 can live joyfully now and prepare for
00:09:01.440 life with our father in heaven in the
00:09:03.279 eternities. As we learn to see Heavenly
00:09:06.160 Father and the Savior in the scriptures,
00:09:08.560 we will come to know them better and we
00:09:10.560 will see their love and influence more
00:09:12.640 frequently and more powerfully in our
00:09:15.440 own lives. I will always remember the
00:09:18.080 spirit I felt as a youth when our
00:09:20.399 teacher taught about the final days of
00:09:22.240 the Savior's life. He helped us see the
00:09:25.360 significance of the events in the upper
00:09:27.120 room, Gethsemane, Goltha, and the empty
00:09:30.160 tomb. He shared his profound gratitude
00:09:33.279 for the Savior and his consuming desire
00:09:35.600 to follow him. His teaching was an
00:09:38.640 invitation for the Holy Ghost to testify
00:09:41.440 of Jesus Christ. And the spirit I felt
00:09:44.399 in that class deepened my faith and
00:09:46.399 increased my love and appreciation for
00:09:48.399 the Savior. The influence of that
00:09:51.040 teacher has stayed with me
00:09:54.800 by
00:09:58.640 my entire life. As was said of another
00:10:02.160 teacher, we could warm our hands by the
00:10:04.880 fire of his faith
00:10:07.440 in our homes and church meetings as we
00:10:09.519 focus on Jesus Christ. teach his
00:10:12.720 doctrine and learn diligently.
00:10:16.399 We invite the Holy Ghost to deepen our
00:10:18.720 faith in Jesus Christ and help us become
00:10:21.519 more like him, which is the aim of all
00:10:24.640 gospel teaching and learning. I'm
00:10:27.440 grateful for the teachers in my life.
00:10:29.839 From goodly parents and local leaders
00:10:31.760 and teachers to the men and women who
00:10:34.079 have been called to teach and testify
00:10:36.720 from this pulpit who help us to know and
00:10:40.000 follow Jesus Christ. And I am grateful
00:10:42.959 for the Holy Ghost, the perfect tutor.
00:10:45.519 It is through the Holy Ghost that I know
00:10:48.160 that heavenly father loves us and has a
00:10:50.959 perfect plan for us. that Jesus is the
00:10:54.320 Christ, the savior and redeemer of the
00:10:57.120 world, and that his gospel and church
00:11:00.079 have been restored. I gratefully testify
00:11:03.360 of these things in the name of Jesus
00:11:06.079 Christ. Amen. Amen.
