00:00:00.719 Thank you choir for your testimony
00:00:02.720 through that new hymn.
00:00:04.960 The new sacrament hymn, Bread of Life,
00:00:07.839 living water fills my soul. One line in
00:00:11.120 the hymn says, "Now I come before the
00:00:13.840 altar, offering him my broken heart." My
00:00:17.840 understanding of those words deepened
00:00:19.600 soon after our family departed Newberry
00:00:21.680 Park, California to serve in the Utah
00:00:24.160 Ogden mission. In 2015, I received an
00:00:27.439 invitation to tour Hill Air Force Base
00:00:29.519 in Leighton, Utah. I'd never been on a
00:00:32.238 military base, nor had I met a military
00:00:34.559 chaplain or the men and women who work
00:00:36.960 to provide safety and protection for
00:00:39.120 their country. Chaplain HARP, like
00:00:41.840 thousands of other voluntary and
00:00:43.680 professional chaplain who serve in our
00:00:46.079 prisons, hospitals, military
00:00:48.000 installations around the world, inspired
00:00:50.640 and uplifted me. Our last stop on the
00:00:53.440 base was the sanctuary. I asked the
00:00:56.239 chaplain if he administered services for
00:00:58.640 all people who desired to ponder, pray,
00:01:01.440 meditate, and worship. He went to the
00:01:03.760 front wall of the chapel, and he pulled
00:01:05.920 a cross from behind the curtains. He
00:01:08.640 said he used the cross for Protestant
00:01:10.479 and Catholic services. I asked what he
00:01:13.360 used for our Jewish brothers and
00:01:14.880 sisters. He went to the other side of
00:01:16.960 the front wall and he pulled out a Star
00:01:18.799 of David. I then asked, "What do you do
00:01:22.000 for Latter-day Saint services?" He
00:01:24.880 pushed those symbols away and pointed to
00:01:27.119 the large wooden altar in the middle of
00:01:29.439 the sanctuary. He said that members of
00:01:32.000 the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
00:01:34.079 Saints prepare and bless the bread and
00:01:36.400 water on the altar. I asked that the
00:01:39.280 large, seemingly fixed altar was removed
00:01:42.000 before the services of our Jewish,
00:01:44.159 Muslim, Catholic, or Protestant brothers
00:01:46.240 and sisters. He said that the altar
00:01:48.720 stays in place for several of those
00:01:51.119 faiths also utilize the altar in some
00:01:53.600 way. Abraham built an altar, bound
00:01:56.880 Isaac, and was ready to sacrifice his
00:01:59.119 only son. But his hand was stayed and he
00:02:02.000 declared like the Lord has declared,
00:02:04.880 "Here am I." How many times has the
00:02:08.160 great I am? Or one of his prophets
00:02:10.318 volunteered, "Here am I." During his
00:02:14.160 sermon on the mount, the Savior invited
00:02:16.000 us to reconcile with our brothers and
00:02:18.080 sisters before we approach the altar.
00:02:21.120 Paul taught that we are sanctified at
00:02:23.120 the altar through the atonement of Jesus
00:02:25.360 Christ. The prophet Lehi left his house
00:02:28.080 and his precious things. Then he built
00:02:30.239 an altar and made an offering and gave
00:02:32.080 thanks unto the Lord. The Bible and the
00:02:34.879 Book of Mormon teach us to worship the
00:02:36.800 son of God at altars. Why? Our first
00:02:40.560 parents, Adam and Eve, built and
00:02:42.319 worshiped at altars. After they were
00:02:44.560 cast out of the Garden of Eden, and had
00:02:46.560 worshiped for many days, an angel
00:02:49.360 visited and asked a poignant question
00:02:51.519 that could be asked of each of us, why
00:02:54.640 dust thou offer sacrifices unto the
00:02:57.840 Lord?
00:03:01.200 Adam answered, I know not. The angel's
00:03:04.720 response to Adam's humble admission is
00:03:07.120 stunning. This is a similitude of the
00:03:10.239 sacrifice of the only begotten of the
00:03:12.400 father. Wherefore thou shalt do all that
00:03:15.040 thou doest in the name of the son, and
00:03:16.879 thou shalt repent and call upon God in
00:03:19.680 the name of the son forever more. The
00:03:22.640 sacrament table and temple altars
00:03:24.879 symbolize the sacrifice of Jesus Christ
00:03:28.000 and his infinite atonement. As we make
00:03:31.040 and honor our covenants, receiving the
00:03:33.280 ordinances of the sacrament of church
00:03:35.599 and the endowment and sealing at the
00:03:37.519 temple, we bind ourselves to the Savior,
00:03:40.560 gaining greater access to his mercy,
00:03:42.879 protection, sanctification, healing, and
00:03:46.000 rest. As a 15-year-old young man, I
00:03:48.879 remember asking my dad if I could skip a
00:03:51.120 sacrament meeting just one Sunday in
00:03:53.519 January for a special American football
00:03:56.080 game. He said, 'I was old enough to make
00:03:58.879 that choice for myself and asked me to
00:04:01.040 consider one piece of counsel. He said,
00:04:03.519 'If you choose to miss the sacrament
00:04:05.360 once, it's much easier to choose to miss
00:04:08.319 it again. If the Savior is the great
00:04:11.200 connector, then the adversary is the
00:04:13.280 separator. He, Satan, tempts us to
00:04:16.720 separate ourselves from our consecrated
00:04:18.798 places of worship and from the
00:04:20.959 protection of Jesus Christ. When we
00:04:23.759 worship the Savior, we receive power to
00:04:26.479 go against the natural worldly flow.
00:04:29.440 When we spend time in communion with
00:04:31.280 him, we have a promise to be delivered
00:04:33.840 from Satan. Then, as we keep our
00:04:36.320 covenants, he endows us with his
00:04:38.639 strengthening power. Oh, how I cherish
00:04:41.520 the experience of communing with the
00:04:43.600 Savior through covenants made at holy
00:04:46.080 altars. Building an understanding of the
00:04:48.880 Savior's eternal atonement, line upon
00:04:51.280 line, precept upon precept, provides a
00:04:54.320 spiritual inoculation against the ws of
00:04:56.960 the adversary. Young Elder Yaggi in
00:04:59.840 Mexico and Zuster Yagi in Belgium and
00:05:02.240 other missionaries throughout the world
00:05:04.240 are much more likely to see their
00:05:06.080 friends claim the blessings of baptism
00:05:08.560 and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost
00:05:10.639 if their friends attend sacrament
00:05:12.720 meeting within the first week of
00:05:14.160 contact. A young adult in Tonga or Samo
00:05:17.759 is much more likely to be sealed in the
00:05:19.840 house of the Lord if they have prepared
00:05:21.919 for and received their endowment soon
00:05:23.919 after graduating from school. In the
00:05:26.720 endowment, members are invited to live,
00:05:29.120 obey, and keep five laws which imbue
00:05:32.080 power and protection. As we make
00:05:35.039 covenants with the Lord, a reciprocal
00:05:37.360 relationship forms. We demonstrate our
00:05:40.160 loyalty and love to him. Our strength
00:05:42.880 and power grow with each promise made
00:05:45.919 and kept. When we humbly and
00:05:48.320 symbolically kneel at the altars of the
00:05:50.160 Lord, it's an opportunity for
00:05:51.759 reflection, checked as to the pride of
00:05:54.720 our hearts. humbling ourselves before
00:05:57.280 God. Before going out with my friends as
00:05:59.919 a youth, my mother would often say,
00:06:01.360 "Remember who you are and check in when
00:06:04.000 you get home." Some nights I miss my
00:06:06.800 check-in because I arrived home too
00:06:08.400 late. I regret missing those important
00:06:11.199 visits with mom. Today I look forward to
00:06:13.919 check-in connections with Heavenly
00:06:15.520 Father. In my daily pattern of personal
00:06:18.479 worship, I kneel in prayer next to my
00:06:20.560 bed or gathered with family. I envision
00:06:23.199 myself kneeling at the altars,
00:06:25.840 reflecting on, examining my life. I
00:06:28.960 think about the sacrament, even whole
00:06:31.600 pieces of bread broken and torn for us.
00:06:35.199 Each a symbol of our savior's broken
00:06:38.080 body. I'm reminded of President Don H.
00:06:41.120 Oak's teaching that each piece of bread
00:06:43.840 is unique, just as the individuals who
00:06:46.960 partake of it are unique. When I kneel
00:06:49.840 in prayer, I think on how I can give God
00:06:52.720 my will. Elder David A. Bedar taught
00:06:55.919 that the ordinance of the sacrament is a
00:06:58.240 holy and repeated invitation to repent
00:07:01.199 sincerely and to be renewed spiritually.
00:07:04.240 The act of partaking of the sacrament in
00:07:06.639 and of itself does not remit sins. But
00:07:09.199 as we prepare conscientiously and
00:07:11.919 participate in this holy ordinance with
00:07:14.479 a broken heart and a contrite spirit,
00:07:16.960 then the promise is that we may always
00:07:19.199 have the spirit of the Lord to be with
00:07:20.960 us. And by the sanctifying power of the
00:07:23.599 Holy Ghost as our constant companion, we
00:07:26.880 can always retain a remission of our
00:07:29.599 sins. When Amy and I look closely at our
00:07:33.199 life experiences,
00:07:35.120 we celebrate
00:07:38.160 the gift of Jesus Christ, perfect love
00:07:40.720 and sacrifice. We also see how hell's
00:07:44.319 fury has been loosed. How can we
00:07:47.120 overcome staires of judgment, anxiety,
00:07:50.080 depression, cancer, diabetes, online
00:07:53.360 bullying, stolen identity, lost
00:07:55.599 pregnancies, the loss of a child, a
00:07:58.160 brother, and a father because Jesus took
00:08:01.360 the bitter cup of trembling, the cup of
00:08:03.759 fury for me, for my family, for all of
00:08:07.280 us. The bitter cup he drank in the
00:08:10.000 garden of Gethsemane and his suffering
00:08:12.400 intensified on the cross at Calvary.
00:08:15.440 allows us to lay the hard, the insolent,
00:08:19.120 the violent, the furious, and the
00:08:20.960 trembling upon the altars of the Lord
00:08:23.360 and be sanctified by the reception of
00:08:25.440 the Holy Ghost always. Sister Patricia
00:08:28.720 Holland said, "My deepest prayer for you
00:08:31.199 and for myself today is that we will
00:08:33.599 give over completely, lay ourselves at
00:08:36.240 the altar of God's promises and peace,
00:08:38.799 no matter where we are and no matter
00:08:40.559 what we have done. When we come to the
00:08:42.958 altar, we aren't earning a reward. We
00:08:44.880 are learning about the giftgiver. In
00:08:47.279 that learning and covenant binding comes
00:08:49.200 healing. Nephi said, "He has filled me
00:08:51.760 with his love even even unto the
00:08:53.600 consuming of my flesh." And our loving
00:08:56.560 Savior invited, "Will ye not now return
00:08:58.800 unto me and repent of your sins and be
00:09:01.440 converted that I may heal you?" When
00:09:03.839 they were little, one of the favorite
00:09:06.000 stories of our two oldest daughters,
00:09:07.680 McKenzie and Emma, was the Chronicles of
00:09:09.839 Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the
00:09:11.680 Wardrobe. We all fell in love with the
00:09:14.000 lion, Alen. One of our most memorable
00:09:16.720 nights reading the book was when the
00:09:18.399 great lion gave his life for Edmund.
00:09:21.519 Memorable because parents and daughters
00:09:23.600 shed tears as the lion's life was taken
00:09:26.320 on the stone table by the witch.
00:09:28.480 Memorable because hope persisted despite
00:09:31.360 the tragedy until the spectacular
00:09:33.519 happened. Squeals of joy resounded in
00:09:36.160 that little bedroom when Alen was
00:09:37.920 resurrected and said, "If the witch knew
00:09:40.480 the true meaning of sacrifice, she would
00:09:42.560 know that if a willing victim who had
00:09:44.800 committed no treachery died in the
00:09:46.480 traitor, the stone table would crack and
00:09:49.200 death itself would begin to unwind.
00:09:52.080 Jesus Christ heals all wounds. Jesus
00:09:55.040 Christ makes it possible to live again."
00:09:57.920 In his October 2022 general conference
00:10:00.640 talk, President Russell M. Nelson
00:10:02.480 described a tour group coming through a
00:10:04.720 temple open house. A young boy was
00:10:07.040 there. He taught. When the tour group
00:10:09.519 entered an endowment room, the boy
00:10:11.120 pointed to the altar where people
00:10:12.800 kneelled to make covenants with God and
00:10:14.720 said, "Oh, that's nice. Here's a pe
00:10:17.440 place for people to rest on their temple
00:10:20.000 journey." He likely had no idea about
00:10:22.640 the direct connection between making a
00:10:24.720 covenant with God in the temple and the
00:10:27.279 Savior's stunning promise. Come unto me
00:10:30.160 all ye that labor and are heavy laden,
00:10:32.720 and I will give you rest. Take my yoke
00:10:35.600 upon you and learn of me, and ye shall
00:10:37.760 find rest unto your souls. For my yoke
00:10:40.800 is easy, and my burden is light. The Son
00:10:44.320 of Man has no place to lay his head. Yet
00:10:47.040 he invited his disciples, you and I, to
00:10:50.720 the sacrament table to rest with him
00:10:52.640 there. When humble souls at altars
00:10:55.760 kneel, peace abounds. Our Savior's arms
00:10:59.440 are outstretched. His table is spread.
00:11:03.360 Come worship the Son of God at his holy
00:11:06.160 altars. In the name of Jesus Christ,
00:11:08.959 amen. Amen.
