00:00:00.880 Dear youth, what a beautiful conference
00:00:03.520 session we are having. We have already
00:00:06.080 heard three living apostles of Jesus
00:00:08.480 Christ. What a wonderful blessing. And
00:00:11.599 we will still hear one more, Elder Henry
00:00:14.880 B. Irene. The spiritual feast continues.
00:00:19.119 When I spoke last year, we learn how to
00:00:22.240 face this world through David's
00:00:24.560 experience with Goliath. Remember the
00:00:27.279 five stones? Well, today I'm sharing an
00:00:30.960 Old Testament story I read at your age,
00:00:34.800 which left me wanting to be like its
00:00:37.600 protagonist.
00:00:39.200 The Bible does not tell us her name. So,
00:00:42.000 we will call her the woman of Shunen
00:00:45.120 because this is the name of her town.
00:00:48.640 One day the prophet Elisha was passing
00:00:52.000 through Shinim and we read that there
00:00:55.680 was a great woman and she invited him to
00:00:59.840 eat bread. And so it was that at often
00:01:03.840 as he passed by he turned in to eat
00:01:07.439 bread. I imagine the prophet Elijah was
00:01:10.960 so happy with invitation to eat at her
00:01:13.439 house.
00:01:14.799 He had already gone several times when
00:01:17.840 one day the woman said to her husband,
00:01:21.439 "Now I perceive that this is a holy man
00:01:26.159 of God." The woman says, "Now I perceive
00:01:30.880 it seems she invited Elisha to her house
00:01:34.400 without knowing he was the prophet." She
00:01:38.320 receives her testimony through the Holy
00:01:40.880 Ghost by listening carefully to what
00:01:43.920 Elisha said and taught. Remember, there
00:01:48.079 were no pictures at that time, so it was
00:01:50.720 hard to recognize the prophet just by
00:01:53.040 his face. But the story does not end
00:01:56.479 there. One day the woman said to her
00:01:59.680 husband, "Let us make a little chamber,
00:02:03.200 and let us set for him there a bed and a
00:02:07.040 table and a stool and a candlestick, and
00:02:11.200 it shall be that when he cometh to us,
00:02:15.200 that he shall turn in."
00:02:18.560 This faithful woman was willing to build
00:02:21.760 a room in her house so that the prophet
00:02:25.360 passing through the city would have a
00:02:28.160 place to stay.
00:02:30.400 Today we can learn a powerful lesson
00:02:32.959 from this experience.
00:02:35.280 The Lord testified to the woman of
00:02:37.680 Shunim that Elisha was a prophet of God
00:02:42.000 and she acted by opening her house to
00:02:45.680 receive him.
00:02:47.599 We too can receive a personal testimony
00:02:50.959 of God's prophets today and open our
00:02:55.040 hearts and minds, our house to the
00:02:58.879 message that our heavenly father has for
00:03:01.519 us in these latter days.
00:03:05.040 Dear youth, I invite you to ask yourself
00:03:08.640 this question. Do I have a personal
00:03:13.120 testimony of God's living prophets?
00:03:17.599 Let's start at the beginning. What is a
00:03:20.080 prophet? A prophet, it's a man whom God
00:03:24.159 has called to speak for him. There are
00:03:27.599 prophets on the earth today just as
00:03:30.400 there were in ancient times.
00:03:33.440 Prophets are seers and revelators.
00:03:36.959 That means they can see what others
00:03:39.840 cannot see and they can prophesy of
00:03:42.879 future events. They can also prepare us
00:03:46.400 for calamities.
00:03:48.319 Prophets receive commandments and
00:03:50.560 revelations from God.
00:03:53.519 The ninth article of faith speaks of the
00:03:56.799 continuing revelation in these last
00:03:59.200 days. It says, "We believe all that God
00:04:03.439 has revealed, all that he does now
00:04:06.400 reveal, and we believe that he will yet
00:04:10.000 reveal many great and important things
00:04:13.680 pertaining to the kingdom of God."
00:04:17.120 Elder Gary E. receiving son said, "The
00:04:20.399 Lord continues to reveal his
00:04:22.800 commandments and will to his prophet
00:04:25.280 today because he desires to lead us to
00:04:28.800 happiness in this life and to celestial
00:04:32.080 glory in the next life."
00:04:35.759 Prophets also proclaim the gospel and
00:04:38.240 are inspired teachers and messengers of
00:04:41.680 God to everyone on earth. Each member of
00:04:46.240 the first presidency and the quorum of
00:04:48.720 the 12 apostles is a prophet, seer and
00:04:53.280 revelator.
00:04:55.199 Serving as a council under the Lord's
00:04:57.680 direction, they have the authority to
00:05:00.479 declare and interpret doctrine and
00:05:03.680 establish policy for his church. They
00:05:07.520 carefully pray and deliberate for the
00:05:10.560 decisions of these quorums must be
00:05:13.680 unanimous. In this way, the Lord assures
00:05:17.199 us that his will will be done.
00:05:21.600 Prophets testify of Christ, his
00:05:24.400 existence, his ministry, and his
00:05:26.800 divinity. Let us read some testimonies
00:05:29.840 of the prophets from the Book of Mormon.
00:05:32.479 Ainadai proclaimed, "God himself shall
00:05:36.000 come down among the children of men and
00:05:38.800 shall redeem his people. And because he
00:05:42.080 dwelleth in flesh, he shall be called
00:05:45.280 the son of God. Samuel the Lammonite
00:05:48.960 also testified that Jesus Christ is the
00:05:52.240 son of God, the father of heaven and of
00:05:56.240 earth, the creator of all things from
00:05:59.840 the beginning. And the prophet Moroni
00:06:02.880 said, "I have seen Jesus and he hath
00:06:07.360 talked with me face to face." When
00:06:11.440 Christ visited the Nephites, one of the
00:06:14.160 first things he did was call 12
00:06:17.759 apostles. And he said to the people,
00:06:20.880 "Blessed are ye if ye shall give heed
00:06:24.400 unto the words of these 12 whom I have
00:06:28.319 chosen."
00:06:30.160 Now, let me share a few words for
00:06:32.639 parents or other family members raising
00:06:35.680 children.
00:06:37.440 The Lord himself taught Adam and Eve the
00:06:40.880 truth of the plan of salvation. And then
00:06:44.160 he said to them, I give unto you a
00:06:47.520 commandment to teach these things freely
00:06:51.360 unto your children.
00:06:53.520 What does it mean to teach freely?
00:06:56.800 It is learning the truth of the gospel,
00:06:59.840 having a personal testimony of them and
00:07:03.039 sharing that knowledge with our
00:07:05.440 children. It is to promote both formal
00:07:09.199 and informal teaching moments. It is
00:07:12.080 living according to that knowledge and
00:07:15.599 testimony.
00:07:17.199 The Book of Mormon describes the 260
00:07:20.720 strippling warriors as men of truth and
00:07:24.080 sovereignness, for they had been taught
00:07:26.639 to keep the commandments of God and to
00:07:29.440 walk uprightly before him. These young
00:07:33.360 men faithfully obeyed Hillean who at
00:07:36.639 that time was their military leader and
00:07:39.520 also their prophet. And they recognized
00:07:43.199 that their mothers had filled their
00:07:46.160 hearts with truth and faith.
00:07:49.599 Parents in this world where there are
00:07:52.479 many voices and sometimes much darkness,
00:07:56.000 God himself himself has commanded us to
00:08:00.879 raise our children in light and truth.
00:08:04.639 He entrusted us with the responsibility
00:08:07.680 to teach our children the saving truth
00:08:10.720 of the gospel. If we fail to do so, the
00:08:15.440 world will not do it.
00:08:19.199 Dear young friends, I have an invitation
00:08:21.759 for you. In the coming days, I invite
00:08:25.199 you to kneel, open your hearts, and pray
00:08:29.039 with faith to Heavenly Father, asking
00:08:32.240 him to confirm to you that his chosen
00:08:35.919 prophet and apostles are his voice on
00:08:40.080 the earth today.
00:08:42.640 The woman of Shunam taught us that we
00:08:45.200 can have that testimony through the Holy
00:08:47.440 Ghost. And I promise you that once we
00:08:51.360 know they are God's anointed ones, our
00:08:55.200 life will be easier in spite of our
00:08:58.560 ongoing challenges as we will obey their
00:09:02.399 voice with trust, faith, and hope. To
00:09:06.959 listen and to obey the voice of the
00:09:09.040 prophet is crucial to holding on to
00:09:12.560 every good thing until the second coming
00:09:15.760 of our savior.
00:09:18.399 The world's wickedness is growing, but
00:09:21.600 the church of Jesus Christ and his
00:09:23.839 kingdom are stronger than ever. Zion is
00:09:28.000 putting on its beautiful garments, and
00:09:30.959 Christ throne will not fall. The Lord
00:09:35.519 expects us to be strong in our
00:09:38.240 testimonies, to be full of faith, and to
00:09:41.040 repent daily. Our savior Jesus Christ is
00:09:44.640 counting on each of us to carry on his
00:09:47.680 work. Once the prophet Joseph Smith
00:09:50.880 said, "Brethren, shall we not go on in
00:09:54.480 so great a cost? However, since this
00:09:57.360 message is mainly for you, the youth, I
00:10:00.000 would like to use the word youth instead
00:10:02.560 of brethren." Ready?
00:10:05.600 Youth, shall we not go on in so great a
00:10:09.120 cost? Go forward and not backward.
00:10:12.880 Courage is and on on to the victory. Let
00:10:17.200 your hearts rejoice and be exceedingly
00:10:20.480 glad.
00:10:22.160 I am grateful for the guidance and the
00:10:25.600 consecrated efforts of the living
00:10:27.839 prophets
00:10:29.360 and I give you my solemn testimony that
00:10:32.720 they are called by God to carry forth,
00:10:37.680 establish and lead his kingdom on earth
00:10:41.279 today. And it will always be so. It will
00:10:46.399 always be the Lord who chooses his
00:10:49.279 servants in the name of Jesus Christ.
00:10:53.040 Amen. Amen.
