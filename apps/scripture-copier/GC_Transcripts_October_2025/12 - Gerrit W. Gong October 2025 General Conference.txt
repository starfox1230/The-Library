00:00:00.800 For 50 years,
00:00:03.280 I have studied culture,
00:00:06.080 including gospel culture.
00:00:09.280 I began with fortune cookies.
00:00:13.759 In San Francisco's Chinatown, Gong
00:00:16.960 Family Dinners concluded with the
00:00:18.880 fortune cookie and a wise saying like,
00:00:22.240 "A journey of a thousand miles begins
00:00:24.640 with a single step."
00:00:27.119 As a young adult, I made fortune
00:00:28.960 cookies. Wearing white cotton gloves, I
00:00:31.920 folded and tucked into shape the round
00:00:34.079 cookies hot out of the oven. To my
00:00:37.920 surprise, I learned fortune cookies are
00:00:41.120 not originally part of Chinese culture.
00:00:46.480 To distinguish Chinese, American, and
00:00:48.879 European fortune cookie culture, I look
00:00:52.000 for fortune cookies on multiple
00:00:53.840 continents. Just as one would use
00:00:56.239 multiple locations to triangulate a
00:00:58.480 forest fire,
00:01:00.480 Chinese restaurants in San Francisco,
00:01:02.960 Los Angeles, and New York serve fortune
00:01:05.119 cookies, but not those in Beijing,
00:01:08.479 London, or Sydney.
00:01:10.880 Only Americans celebrate National
00:01:14.240 Fortune Cookie Day.
00:01:18.880 And only Chinese advertisements offer
00:01:22.320 authentic American fortune cookies.
00:01:27.840 Fortune cookies are a fun simple
00:01:29.759 example. But the same principle of
00:01:32.560 comparing practices in different
00:01:34.799 cultural settings can help us
00:01:37.200 distinguish gospel culture. And now the
00:01:40.640 Lord is opening new opportunities to
00:01:43.119 learn gospel culture as Book of Mormon
00:01:46.240 allegory and New Testament parapo
00:01:48.799 parable prophecies are fulfilled.
00:01:52.159 Everywhere people are moving. The United
00:01:55.600 Nations reports 281 million
00:01:58.640 international migrants. This is 128
00:02:02.479 million more individuals than in 1990
00:02:05.600 and more than three times 1970
00:02:08.399 estimates.
00:02:09.840 Everywhere, record numbers of converts
00:02:13.200 are finding the Church of Jesus Christ
00:02:15.599 of Latter-day Saints. Every Sabbath,
00:02:18.640 members and friends from 195 birth
00:02:21.599 countries and territories gather in
00:02:24.319 31,916
00:02:26.800 church congregations.
00:02:28.800 We speak
00:02:30.720 125 languages.
00:02:33.440 Recently in Albania,
00:02:36.319 North Macedonia,
00:02:38.239 Kosovo, Switzerland, and Germany, I
00:02:41.680 witnessed new members fulfilling the
00:02:43.519 Book of Mormon allegory of the olive
00:02:45.599 tree. In Jacob chapter 5, the Lord of
00:02:49.200 the vineyard and his servants strengthen
00:02:51.200 both olive tree roots and branches by
00:02:55.760 gathering and grafting together those
00:02:57.920 from diverse locations.
00:03:00.160 Today children of God gather as one in
00:03:03.440 Jesus Christ. The Lord offers a
00:03:06.319 remarkable natural means to expand our
00:03:09.680 love and lived fullness of his restored
00:03:13.040 gospel.
00:03:14.959 Preparing us for the kingdom of heaven.
00:03:17.440 Jesus tells the parables of the great
00:03:19.599 supper and wedding feast. In these
00:03:22.319 parables, invited guests make excuses
00:03:25.760 not to come.
00:03:27.760 The master instructs his servants to go
00:03:29.920 out quickly into the streets and lanes
00:03:31.840 of the city and the highways and hedges
00:03:34.560 to bring in hither the poor, maimed,
00:03:38.000 halt, and blind.
00:03:40.480 Spiritually speaking, that's each of us.
00:03:44.159 Scripture declares, "All nations shall
00:03:47.360 be invited unto a supper of the house of
00:03:49.519 the Lord. Prepare ye the way of the
00:03:52.239 Lord, that his kingdom may go forth upon
00:03:54.480 the earth, that the inhabitants thereof
00:03:57.200 may receive it, and be prepared for the
00:03:59.920 days to come. Today, those invited to
00:04:04.000 the supper of the Lord come from every
00:04:06.159 place and culture, old and young, rich
00:04:10.080 and poor, local and global. We make our
00:04:13.760 church congregations look like our
00:04:16.000 communities.
00:04:17.918 As chief apostle, Peter saw heaven open
00:04:20.959 a vision of a great sheep knitted at the
00:04:23.919 four corners wherein were all manner of
00:04:26.080 beasts. Taught Peter of a truth I
00:04:30.400 perceive that God is no respector of
00:04:33.440 persons. In every nation he that fearth
00:04:37.360 the Lord and workketh righteousness is
00:04:40.560 accepted with him." End quote. In the
00:04:44.320 parable of the good Samaritan, Jesus
00:04:47.120 invites us to come to each other and to
00:04:50.320 him in his inn, his church. He invites
00:04:54.639 us to be good neighbors. The good
00:04:57.440 Samaritan promises to return and
00:04:59.520 recompense the care of those in his inn.
00:05:02.560 Living the gospel of Jesus Christ
00:05:05.360 includes making room for all in his
00:05:08.639 restored church.
00:05:10.800 The spirit of room in the inn includes
00:05:13.520 no one sits alone.
00:05:15.840 When you come to church, if you see
00:05:17.759 someone alone, will you please say hello
00:05:20.320 and sit with him or her? This may not be
00:05:23.840 your custom. The person may look or
00:05:25.680 speak differently than you. And of
00:05:28.400 course, as a fortune cookie might say, a
00:05:31.680 journey of gospel friendship and love
00:05:34.960 begins with a first hello and no one
00:05:38.240 sitting alone.
00:05:40.720 No one sits alone also means no one sits
00:05:43.440 alone emotionally or spiritually.
00:05:47.520 I went with a brokenhearted father to
00:05:49.680 visit his son.
00:05:51.759 Years earlier, the son was excited to
00:05:54.080 become a new deacon. The occasion
00:05:56.880 included his family buying him his first
00:06:01.360 pair of new shoes.
00:06:04.800 But at church, the deacons laughed at
00:06:06.639 him. His shoes were new, but not
00:06:09.840 fashionable.
00:06:11.520 Embarrassed and hurt, the new deacon
00:06:14.319 said he would never go again to church.
00:06:17.759 My heart is still broken for him and his
00:06:21.360 family.
00:06:23.759 On the dusty roads to Jericho,
00:06:26.880 each of us has been laughed at,
00:06:29.440 embarrassed, and hurt, perhaps scorned
00:06:32.160 or abused,
00:06:34.240 and with varying degrees of intent. Each
00:06:37.919 of us has also disregarded,
00:06:41.199 not seen or heard, perhaps deliberately
00:06:44.319 hurt others. It is precisely because we
00:06:48.160 have been hurt and have hurt others that
00:06:52.240 Jesus Christ brings us all to his end in
00:06:57.199 his church and through his ordinances
00:06:58.960 and covenants. We come to each other and
00:07:02.240 to Jesus Christ. We love and are loved,
00:07:07.039 serve and are served, forgive and are
00:07:11.520 forgiven.
00:07:13.360 Please remember, earth has no sorrow
00:07:17.680 that heaven cannot heal.
00:07:20.639 Earth burdens lighten. Our Savior's joy
00:07:24.639 is real.
00:07:26.960 In First Nephi chapter 19, we read,
00:07:29.520 quote, "Even the very son of Israel do
00:07:33.280 they trample under their feet. They set
00:07:36.400 him at not. Wherefore they scourge him,
00:07:39.840 and he suffereth it, and they smite him,
00:07:43.120 and he suffereth it. Yay, they spit upon
00:07:46.160 him, and he suffereth it. My friend,
00:07:49.680 Professor Terry Warner, says the
00:07:51.520 judging, scourging, smiting, and
00:07:53.360 spitting were not occasional events that
00:07:56.720 occurred only during Christ's mortal
00:07:58.960 life. How we treat each other,
00:08:02.080 especially the hungry, thirsty, those
00:08:04.400 left out alone, is how we treat him.
00:08:08.800 In his restored church, we are all
00:08:10.960 better when no one sits alone. Let us
00:08:13.759 not simply accommodate or tolerate. Let
00:08:17.440 us genuinely welcome, acknowledge,
00:08:20.319 minister to love. May each friend,
00:08:23.759 sister, brother not be a foreigner or
00:08:25.919 stranger, but a child at home.
00:08:30.080 Today, many feel lonely and isolated.
00:08:34.159 Social media and artificial intelligence
00:08:36.880 can leave us yearning for human
00:08:39.120 closeness and human touch. We want to
00:08:42.799 hear each other's voices. We want
00:08:44.800 authentic belonging and kindness.
00:08:48.480 There are many reasons we may feel we do
00:08:50.640 not fit in a church. That speaking
00:08:53.600 figuratively, we sit alone.
00:08:56.720 We may worry about our accent, clothes,
00:08:59.279 family situation. Perhaps we feel
00:09:01.839 inadequate, smell of smoke, yearn for
00:09:04.720 moral cleanliness, have broken up with
00:09:06.800 someone and feel hurt and embarrassed,
00:09:09.200 are concerned about this or that church
00:09:11.600 policy.
00:09:13.360 We may be single, divorced, widowed.
00:09:17.600 Our children are noisy. We don't have
00:09:20.640 children. We didn't serve a mission or
00:09:23.360 came home early. The list goes on.
00:09:27.680 Mosiah chapter 18 invites us to knit our
00:09:30.720 hearts together in love. I invite us to
00:09:34.560 worry less, judge less, be less
00:09:38.000 demanding of others,
00:09:40.399 and when needed, to be less hard on
00:09:43.680 ourselves.
00:09:45.200 We do not create Zion in a day, but each
00:09:48.320 hello, each warm gesture brings Zion
00:09:51.680 closer. Let us trust the Lord more and
00:09:55.680 choose joyfully to obey all his
00:09:58.560 commandments.
00:10:00.720 Doctrinally, in the household of faith
00:10:02.959 and fellowship of the saints, no one
00:10:05.440 sits alone because of covenant belonging
00:10:07.760 in Jesus Christ, taught the prophet
00:10:10.399 Joseph Smith, quote, "It is left for us
00:10:13.200 to see, participate in, and help to roll
00:10:15.920 forward the latter-day glory, the
00:10:18.800 dispensation of the fullness of times
00:10:21.680 when the saints of God will be gathered
00:10:24.000 in one from every nation and kindred and
00:10:27.680 people." End quote. God doeth not
00:10:30.880 anything, save it be for the benefit of
00:10:33.279 the world, that he may draw all men and
00:10:36.480 women unto him. He inviteth them all to
00:10:40.560 come unto him and partake of his
00:10:42.959 goodness, and all are alike unto God.
00:10:48.720 Conversion in Jesus Christ requires us
00:10:51.120 to put off the natural man and worldly
00:10:53.200 culture. As President Dan H. Oaks
00:10:56.320 teaches we're to give up any tradition
00:10:58.880 and cultural practice that is contrary
00:11:01.680 to the commandments of God and to become
00:11:04.560 Latter-day Saints. He explains, quote,
00:11:07.680 there is a unique gospel culture, a set
00:11:10.560 of values and expectations and practices
00:11:13.920 common to all the members of the Church
00:11:16.000 of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
00:11:18.560 End quote. Gospel culture includes
00:11:21.120 attendance at church, abstaining from
00:11:23.600 alcohol, tobacco, tea, and coffee. It
00:11:26.560 includes honesty and integrity,
00:11:29.200 understanding we move forward, not up or
00:11:31.680 downward, in church positions.
00:11:35.519 I learned from faithful members and
00:11:37.839 friends in every land and culture.
00:11:40.800 Scriptures studied in multiple languages
00:11:42.880 and cultural perspectives deepen gospel
00:11:45.839 understanding. Different expressions of
00:11:48.399 Christlike attributes deepen my love and
00:11:52.000 understanding of my savior. All are
00:11:54.800 blessed when we define our cultural
00:11:57.440 identity as Preston Russell M. Nelson
00:12:00.560 taught as a child of God, a child of the
00:12:04.240 covenant, a disciple of Jesus Christ.
00:12:08.639 The peace of Jesus Christ is meant for
00:12:10.720 us personally.
00:12:12.480 Recently a young man earnestly asked
00:12:14.560 Elder Gong, "Can I still go to heaven?"
00:12:18.639 He wondered if he could ever be
00:12:20.240 forgiven.
00:12:21.760 I asked his name, listened carefully,
00:12:24.880 invited him to talk with his bishop,
00:12:27.600 gave him a big hug. He left with hope in
00:12:31.519 Jesus Christ. I mentioned the young man
00:12:34.399 in another setting. Later, I received an
00:12:37.519 unsigned letter that began, "Elder Gong,
00:12:41.519 my wife and I have raised nine kids and
00:12:44.000 served two missions, but I have always
00:12:46.880 felt I would not be allowed in the
00:12:48.800 celestial kingdom because my sins as a
00:12:52.000 youth were so bad."
00:12:54.800 The letter continued, Elder Gong, when
00:12:57.519 you told about the young man gaining
00:12:59.600 hope of forgiveness,
00:13:01.680 I was filled with joy, beginning to
00:13:04.959 realize that maybe I could be forgiven.
00:13:09.120 The letter concludes, I even like myself
00:13:12.560 now.
00:13:14.800 Covenant belonging deepens as we come to
00:13:17.279 each other and to the Lord in his in.
00:13:21.279 The Lord blesses us all when no one sits
00:13:25.200 alone. And who knows, maybe the person
00:13:28.639 we sit next to may become our best
00:13:32.160 fortune cookie country, our best fortune
00:13:34.639 cookie friend. May we find and make
00:13:37.600 place for him and each other at the
00:13:41.040 supper of the lamb. I humbly pray in the
00:13:45.120 holy name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
