00:00:00.880 As I study the scriptures, I come across
00:00:04.080 words that really catch my attention
00:00:07.040 primarily because they have special
00:00:08.880 meaning as a result of experiences I
00:00:11.200 have had during my life. I spent my
00:00:14.320 career working as a forensic accountant.
00:00:17.520 With that background, the word reconcile
00:00:20.560 has caught my attention as I read the
00:00:22.880 scriptures. My job was to reconcile
00:00:26.000 reported amounts with financial records.
00:00:30.240 by applying accounting, auditing, and
00:00:33.040 investigative skills. In other words, my
00:00:35.760 goal was to align the financial reports
00:00:38.079 with the underlying financial documents
00:00:40.960 to ensure accuracy and validity. I made
00:00:44.320 diligent efforts to resolve
00:00:46.079 discrepancies, and it was common that
00:00:48.239 significant time was dedicated to
00:00:50.800 resolving even very small discrepancies.
00:00:54.399 The Apostle Paul pled with the
00:00:56.399 Corinthians to be reconciled to God. To
00:01:00.079 be reconciled to God means to be brought
00:01:02.320 back into harmony with God or to restore
00:01:05.519 a relationship with God that has been
00:01:08.880 strained or broken because of our sins
00:01:11.040 or actions. Simply put, being reconciled
00:01:14.320 to God means aligning our will and
00:01:17.439 actions with God's will. Or is taught by
00:01:20.479 President Russell M. Nelson, letting God
00:01:23.439 prevail in our lives. As taught in the
00:01:26.799 scriptures, we are free to act for
00:01:28.799 ourselves, to choose the way of
00:01:31.280 everlasting death or the way of eternal
00:01:34.400 life. But if we are not diligent, this
00:01:38.000 freedom to act for ourselves may lead to
00:01:41.680 a loss of alignment with the will of
00:01:43.840 God.
00:01:45.280 The prophet Jacob taught that when we
00:01:47.520 find ourselves in disharmony or
00:01:50.079 misalignment with God, the only way we
00:01:52.960 can achieve reconciliation is to be
00:01:55.280 reconciled unto God through the
00:01:57.280 atonement of Christ. We must realize
00:02:00.640 that reconciliation is dependent on
00:02:03.119 mercy, implying that Jesus Christ's
00:02:06.320 gracious act of atonement makes
00:02:09.038 reconciliation possible.
00:02:11.920 As you ponder your own life, think about
00:02:14.800 a time when you felt distant from
00:02:17.040 Heavenly Father because you had moved
00:02:19.840 away from him. For instance, perhaps you
00:02:23.040 became less diligent in your prayers to
00:02:25.280 him or in keeping his commandments. Just
00:02:28.640 as we choose to distance ourselves from
00:02:30.879 God, we must choose to initiate the
00:02:33.840 effort to reconcile. The Lord emphasized
00:02:37.040 our responsibility when he said,"Draw
00:02:39.519 near unto me and I will draw near unto
00:02:42.879 you. Seek me diligently and you shall
00:02:45.920 find me. Ask and you shall receive.
00:02:49.680 Knock and it shall be open unto you."
00:02:53.360 How does the Savior help us restore and
00:02:55.760 reconcile this important relationship?
00:02:58.480 For me, I make great progress in my
00:03:01.200 journey to be reconciled to God. when I
00:03:03.920 follow the council taught by President
00:03:06.000 Nelson and repent every day. The reason
00:03:09.519 being that reconciliation signifies the
00:03:13.280 restoration of a broken relationship,
00:03:16.159 particularly between God and humanity by
00:03:19.360 removing the barrier of sin.
00:03:22.480 One of the great reconciliations we read
00:03:24.800 about in the scriptures is that of Enus.
00:03:27.760 Something in his life was out of
00:03:29.599 alignment with God. He exemplified
00:03:32.720 relying on the atonement of Jesus Christ
00:03:35.040 to reconcile with God. He explained his
00:03:38.239 desire to repent. His humility, his
00:03:41.360 focus, and his determination.
00:03:44.000 His reconciliation with God was
00:03:46.720 confirmed when a voice came to him
00:03:49.280 saying, "Enus, thy sins are forgiven
00:03:51.920 thee, and thou shalt be blessed." Enus
00:03:55.519 recognized the impact that repentance
00:03:58.640 and reconciliation had on him when he
00:04:01.280 said, "And I, Enus, knew that God could
00:04:04.640 not lie. Wherefore my guilt was swept
00:04:07.439 away."
00:04:09.760 Reconciliation brings not only relief
00:04:12.080 from feelings of guilt, but also peace
00:04:14.480 within ourselves and with others. It
00:04:17.040 heals relationships, softens hearts, and
00:04:19.918 strengthens our disciplehip, bringing
00:04:22.639 increased confidence before God. What
00:04:25.759 brings me great hope and confidence is
00:04:28.080 another fruit of reconciliation
00:04:29.919 described by Enus when he said, "And
00:04:33.360 after I, Enus, had heard these words, my
00:04:36.720 faith began to be unshaken in the Lord."
00:04:40.160 When I was a boy, my maternal
00:04:42.080 grandfather had a large cherry orchard.
00:04:45.440 I had the opportunity to work in the
00:04:47.440 orchard mostly in the summer during the
00:04:49.919 harvest of the cherries. As a very young
00:04:52.639 boy, the extent of my involvement was
00:04:54.720 being handed a bucket and then sent up a
00:04:57.120 tree to pick the cherries. The
00:04:59.360 harvesting of cherries changed
00:05:01.120 significantly when my grandfather
00:05:03.759 purchased a machine called a cherry
00:05:06.400 shaker.
00:05:08.320 This machine grabs the trunk of the tree
00:05:11.199 and shakes it, causing the cherries to
00:05:14.000 fall out of the tree onto nets that are
00:05:17.199 used to collect the cherries. I noticed
00:05:20.000 that when the shaker would begin to
00:05:21.680 shake the tree, almost all the cherries
00:05:24.080 fell out of the tree within seconds. I
00:05:26.800 also noticed that it didn't matter if
00:05:28.800 the tree was shaken for 10 seconds or a
00:05:31.520 full minute, some cherries would not
00:05:34.000 fall. They were truly unshakable.
00:05:38.000 Shaking cherries out of a tree is
00:05:40.000 possible because of the release of
00:05:42.000 ethylene.
00:05:43.520 This hormone causes the layer of cells
00:05:46.080 between the stem of the cherry and the
00:05:48.639 tree to weaken. Therefore, the stem of a
00:05:51.680 ripe cherry more easily detaches from
00:05:54.240 the tree because of the weakened
00:05:56.400 connection.
00:05:58.639 In the scriptures, we learn that the
00:06:00.639 stem of Jesse is a metaphor for the
00:06:03.600 Messiah, Jesus Christ, who was
00:06:06.240 prophesied to come from the lineage of
00:06:08.319 Jesse, the father of King David. Just as
00:06:11.840 ethylene weakens the connection of a
00:06:14.319 ripe cherry stem, disobedience, doubts,
00:06:17.919 and fears can weaken our connection to
00:06:20.479 the stem of Jesse or Jesus Christ,
00:06:23.520 allowing us to be easily shaken and
00:06:26.479 separated from him.
00:06:29.120 As faithful as we may be, we must guard
00:06:31.680 against a weakening of our connection to
00:06:34.080 Jesus Christ. In the Doctrine and
00:06:36.560 Covenants, even the faithful are given a
00:06:38.880 warning. But there is a possibility that
00:06:41.680 man may fall from grace and depart from
00:06:44.479 the living God. The Lord continues,
00:06:47.280 "Yes, even let those who are sanctified
00:06:50.400 take heed also to avoid falling. The
00:06:53.600 Lord counsels, therefore, let the church
00:06:56.720 take heed and pray always, lest they
00:06:59.680 fall into temptation."
00:07:02.160 One might equate the state of being
00:07:04.000 easily shaken to what scriptures
00:07:06.240 describe as being ripe for destruction
00:07:09.680 with impending consequences for actions.
00:07:13.120 The phrase can also be used more broadly
00:07:15.599 to indicate a state of decay, corruption
00:07:18.720 or decline that makes something
00:07:20.639 susceptible to collapse or ruin.
00:07:24.800 What does this ripeness represent? Does
00:07:27.039 it mean that we can reach a point where
00:07:29.599 we are unable to change? No. I think it
00:07:33.199 means we can reach a point in time where
00:07:35.360 we are unwilling to change.
00:07:38.639 The antidote to becoming ripe for
00:07:40.960 destruction is to do those things that
00:07:43.840 will strengthen our connection to Jesus
00:07:47.039 Christ. As mentioned, repentance led us
00:07:50.400 to the point of unshaken faith. There is
00:07:53.360 strength in repentance. regular, prompt,
00:07:56.000 and frequent repentance. As President
00:07:58.639 Nelson taught us, nothing is more
00:08:01.120 liberating, more enobbling, or more
00:08:03.280 crucial to our individual progression
00:08:05.840 than is a regular daily focus on
00:08:08.960 repentance. In addition to repentance,
00:08:12.000 the prophet Jacob taught that being
00:08:14.000 aware of God's hand in our lives,
00:08:16.800 seeking and receiving revelation, and
00:08:19.520 listening to God when he speaks, all
00:08:22.400 help us to not be shaken.
00:08:25.840 Jacob also taught, "Wherefore we search
00:08:28.479 the prophets, and we have many
00:08:30.720 revelations and the spirit of prophecy,
00:08:34.080 and having all these witnesses, we
00:08:36.958 obtain a hope, and our faith becometh
00:08:40.159 unshaken."
00:08:41.760 Listening to and acting on the words and
00:08:44.240 invitations of the prophets and apostles
00:08:47.040 can fill us with hope, confidence, and
00:08:50.000 strength, resulting in our faith
00:08:52.240 becoming unshaken. I have learned that a
00:08:56.240 desire to be reconciled to God must be
00:08:59.680 accompanied by a desire to repent.
00:09:03.279 Repenting and experiencing the blessings
00:09:05.680 of the atonement of Jesus Christ leads
00:09:08.959 to unshaken faith. Unshaken faith leads
00:09:13.279 to a desire to always be reconciled to
00:09:15.839 God. This is a circular or iterative
00:09:19.360 pattern.
00:09:20.880 Brothers and sisters, I invite you to be
00:09:23.680 reconciled to God through the atonement
00:09:26.959 of Jesus Christ. I testify that making
00:09:31.279 and keeping covenants makes our
00:09:34.000 connection to the Savior strong,
00:09:37.200 thereby avoiding becoming ripe for
00:09:39.680 destruction. I testify that this
00:09:42.560 reconciliation to God through Jesus
00:09:45.600 Christ's atonement leads to unshaken
00:09:49.040 faith. I know heavenly father loves you
00:09:52.080 and me and he sent his beloved son Jesus
00:09:55.360 Christ to be our savior, redeemer and
00:09:59.120 the great reconciler.
00:10:01.360 I testify of Jesus Christ and do so in
00:10:04.399 the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
