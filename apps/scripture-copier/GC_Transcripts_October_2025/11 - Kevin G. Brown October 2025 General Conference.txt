00:00:01.839 My dear brothers and sisters, lately
00:00:04.319 I've been reflecting on three powerful
00:00:07.359 truths from the restoration.
00:00:09.840 These truths have profoundly blessed my
00:00:11.840 life. Today I would like to share with
00:00:14.799 you how these truths have guided me on
00:00:17.199 my journey toward a sure witness of the
00:00:20.240 gospel of Jesus Christ. Number one, God
00:00:23.920 is our loving heavenly father. He is
00:00:26.560 omnisient and omnipotent through the
00:00:29.279 light of Christ and the ministration of
00:00:31.599 the Holy Ghost. His influence is
00:00:34.320 everywhere. It is in his nature to bless
00:00:38.320 us. He sees our past, present, and
00:00:42.320 eternal destiny. Nothing can be hidden
00:00:45.360 from him. President Russell M. Nelson's
00:00:48.399 invitation to think celestial encourages
00:00:51.920 encourages us to emulate our heavenly
00:00:54.239 father's vision and nature
00:00:57.680 because of his divine attributes. Our
00:01:00.320 heavenly father gives us every good gift
00:01:03.760 each with his eternal perspective and
00:01:06.799 vision in mind. Number two, agency is
00:01:11.119 the gift to choose and act for
00:01:13.200 ourselves. It is also the responsibility
00:01:17.200 to choose well. Jesus Christ paid the
00:01:20.799 ultimate price for that privilege with
00:01:23.200 his precious blood. Sometimes we might
00:01:26.400 believe that agency means doing whatever
00:01:28.560 we want. But the fact that the price was
00:01:31.920 paid means agency is a sacred gift.
00:01:36.479 We are agents and agents are responsible
00:01:39.040 for something. In this case, we're
00:01:41.920 responsible for the choices we make
00:01:44.799 based on the knowledge we have and the
00:01:48.000 gifts we are given.
00:01:50.479 We cannot make a choice without being
00:01:53.680 responsible for the consequences.
00:01:56.720 Why do we have agency? To choose good,
00:02:00.640 to choose Christ, to choose eternal life
00:02:03.920 again and again.
00:02:06.479 Number three, our testimony comes
00:02:08.720 through the power of the Holy Ghost. A
00:02:11.680 witness from the Holy Ghost is greater
00:02:13.680 than sight. He is the preeminent witness
00:02:17.120 of the Father and the Son. President
00:02:19.760 Nelson taught in the coming days it will
00:02:21.840 not be possible to survive spiritually
00:02:24.480 without the guiding, directing,
00:02:26.239 comforting, and constant influence of
00:02:28.160 the Holy Ghost. Brothers and sisters,
00:02:30.879 this is why we each need the power of
00:02:32.959 the Holy Ghost today. A testimony
00:02:35.840 through the Holy Ghost can come in many
00:02:37.599 ways. Like a light bulb in a dark room,
00:02:40.400 it can come on dramatically and
00:02:42.080 suddenly. It can come like the sunrise
00:02:45.599 gradually and over time. It can come
00:02:48.400 like rays of light, intermittent
00:02:50.640 exposure to pure intelligence.
00:02:53.360 Whatever the way it comes, whatever the
00:02:56.239 way it comes through the Holy Ghost.
00:03:00.000 I grew up in beautiful Jamaica. It was
00:03:02.959 fun and wonderful. However, when I
00:03:05.760 started high school, some classmates and
00:03:08.159 friends could not understand my decision
00:03:10.239 to be a member of the church of Jesus
00:03:12.239 Christ. How could you join that church?
00:03:15.680 They would ask. How could you believe
00:03:18.319 that story referring to the first
00:03:20.480 vision?
00:03:22.000 How could you read that book referring
00:03:24.560 to the Book of Mormon? Do you really
00:03:27.200 believe all that?
00:03:29.280 and why are you wasting your life away?
00:03:32.640 It was painful, especially when it came
00:03:35.599 from people I cared about.
00:03:38.560 But what they did not know was this.
00:03:42.319 I had an experience with the Holy Ghost.
00:03:46.480 As that testimony filled my heart, it
00:03:49.360 dulled the pain of days. And for one
00:03:52.400 brief moment, heaven's view appeared
00:03:55.200 before my gaze.
00:03:57.599 Perhaps you have been asked some of
00:03:59.599 these questions. Perhaps even now you
00:04:02.400 are being bombarded as I was.
00:04:05.519 The gift and witness of the Holy Ghost
00:04:09.280 are available to everyone.
00:04:12.799 Jamaica is to me like Palmyra was to
00:04:14.959 Joseph Smith. It is my sacred grove. I
00:04:18.880 do not know the exact spot where Joseph
00:04:21.120 knelt to pray in the Sacred Grove, but I
00:04:23.680 know exactly where I was when my Sacred
00:04:27.120 Grove became a reality. It happened at
00:04:30.160 Four Grove Road, Mandville, Jamaica, in
00:04:34.160 my bathroom at 6:00 a.m. on a Wednesday,
00:04:39.919 3 years after my baptism.
00:04:43.360 This sacred experience happened because
00:04:45.440 two weeks earlier, an inspired sister
00:04:48.000 missionary invited me to read the Book
00:04:50.479 of Mormon. Sister Audrey Krauss is
00:04:53.440 attending this conference today with her
00:04:55.440 family, and I forever love her. That
00:04:59.199 experience changed me.
00:05:02.560 Brothers and sisters, a testimony is not
00:05:07.039 given for temporary use.
00:05:10.400 This gift from our heavenly father, our
00:05:13.039 loving heavenly father is meant to be
00:05:15.759 eternal because the giver is eternal.
00:05:20.240 A testimony should not have an
00:05:22.080 expiration date. It should not weaken or
00:05:25.280 diminish because something in my life
00:05:27.360 has changed or something in the world
00:05:29.440 has changed.
00:05:31.520 It should get stronger because like the
00:05:35.120 servant in the parable of the talents,
00:05:37.919 my personal testimony is a gift to be
00:05:41.360 multiplied, not buried.
00:05:45.120 Looking back on those difficult days of
00:05:47.280 testing and persecution that I went
00:05:49.759 through as a child has helped me to get
00:05:52.160 to the place where I now know for
00:05:55.600 myself. I not only believe, hope, or
00:05:58.800 trust, even though these are all
00:06:01.120 significant particles of faith on the
00:06:03.039 pathway to a sure witness. I commend you
00:06:06.080 for making your own way by asking
00:06:09.039 questions, studying, praying, fasting,
00:06:12.560 and pondering.
00:06:14.400 Please don't stop. It is worth every
00:06:17.919 effort to pursue this pastor testimony.
00:06:22.319 Who or what will you allow to take that
00:06:26.160 away?
00:06:28.800 What greater witness can you have than
00:06:32.479 from God?
00:06:35.919 Every son or daughter of God can gain a
00:06:38.639 deeper, firmer, and sureer knowledge for
00:06:41.120 themselves. Like Joseph Smith who
00:06:43.600 affirmed his testimony despite
00:06:45.199 opposition. We can boldly say, "I knew
00:06:48.560 it and I knew that God knew it and I
00:06:51.280 could not deny it. Neither dare I do
00:06:54.080 it."
00:06:56.240 My dear brothers and sisters,
00:06:58.880 let the small seedling of testimony work
00:07:01.280 in you until it springs up to an
00:07:03.520 everlastingly glorious sure knowledge.
00:07:08.319 If you are a baptized member and
00:07:11.039 confirmed member of the Church of Jesus
00:07:12.720 Christ of Latter-day Saints, but still
00:07:14.720 struggle with I'm not sure if I know,
00:07:18.080 please remember this promise in the
00:07:20.000 sacrament prayer that they may always
00:07:23.120 have his spirit to be with them. Because
00:07:26.160 of this promise, each of us can pursue
00:07:28.479 the pastor of testimony and assure
00:07:31.360 knowledge.
00:07:33.120 Now, here is a grand truth. In whatever
00:07:36.319 way a testimony is given, whether it is
00:07:38.880 distilled like the sunrise or comes in a
00:07:41.360 glorious vision, it still requires a
00:07:45.199 choice to receive this precious gift.
00:07:49.759 Saying, "I choose to believe," makes it
00:07:52.400 easier to receive a witness from God. If
00:07:55.599 we find our testimony weakening,
00:07:58.080 remember that it is the choices we make
00:08:00.960 that diminish the power of the
00:08:02.639 testimony. But the testimony has not
00:08:04.960 gone anywhere. We just need to choose to
00:08:07.599 reconnect with it. Choosing to believe
00:08:10.879 is a wise and powerful way to use our
00:08:14.080 agency.
00:08:16.639 I cannot see a better way to use my
00:08:19.360 agency than in defense of my testimony.
00:08:25.039 President Nelson taught, "I plead with
00:08:27.840 you to take charge of your testimony.
00:08:30.479 Work for it. Own it. Care for it.
00:08:32.640 Nurture it." so that it will grow. Feed
00:08:35.039 the truth.
00:08:37.200 To me, the words take charge, work,
00:08:41.360 care, own, nurture, and feed sound like
00:08:45.279 an agent given stewardship for something
00:08:49.040 precious and important.
00:08:52.959 In the early church, Parley Prepprat
00:08:55.279 felt disgruntled with the prophet Joseph
00:08:57.200 Smith and chose to criticize him and the
00:08:59.760 church. When John Taylor, whom Parley
00:09:02.320 taught the gospel, came to town, Parley
00:09:04.320 took him aside and warned him not to
00:09:06.480 follow Joseph, John Taylor said to
00:09:09.360 Parley, "Before you left Canada, you
00:09:13.200 bore a strong testimony of Joseph Smith
00:09:15.600 being a prophet of God, and you said you
00:09:17.760 knew these things by revelation and the
00:09:20.160 gift of the Holy Ghost." I now have that
00:09:24.160 same testimony that you then rejoiced
00:09:27.200 in. If the work was true six months ago,
00:09:30.240 it is true today. If Joseph Smith was
00:09:33.200 then a prophet, he is now a prophet.
00:09:37.120 I testify that Joseph Smith was a
00:09:39.200 prophet of God and that the prophetic
00:09:41.440 mantle he received continues today.
00:09:45.279 Jesus Christ directs this work. I invite
00:09:49.440 you to think about your path to a sure
00:09:52.560 witness of Jesus Christ and his gospel.
00:09:55.360 Take charge of your testimony. Use your
00:09:58.240 agency wisely and acknowledge the giver
00:10:00.720 and his glorious attributes. I bear
00:10:03.440 witness that the power is within you. No
00:10:06.880 one can choose for you. No one can take
00:10:11.519 this gift away. You can choose to
00:10:15.360 believe.
00:10:17.200 I promise you that as you do this, your
00:10:20.079 testimony will be a well of living water
00:10:22.480 springing up onto everlasting life. It
00:10:24.880 will be an anchor and a motivator and it
00:10:27.200 will sustain you through difficult
00:10:29.279 times. It will it will enable you to
00:10:32.320 develop spiritual gifts. It will help
00:10:35.200 you in your personal ministry and
00:10:37.760 service. It will be a weapon against
00:10:40.640 Satan and your adversaries. Your
00:10:43.440 testimony will be a joy as you see it
00:10:46.240 replicated in your children,
00:10:47.920 grandchildren, and great grandchildren
00:10:49.920 and in those you love and serve. It will
00:10:53.120 be powerful when you share it and use it
00:10:56.079 to testify. If you know, you know,
00:11:02.160 I know that I know. We need more sure
00:11:06.160 witnesses of Jesus Christ and his
00:11:08.000 gospel. Get there. Seek it. It is
00:11:11.519 urgent. This is the final dispensation
00:11:14.640 of the fullness of times. Jesus Christ
00:11:17.839 declared this truth. Heaven and earth
00:11:20.079 shall pass away, but my words shall not
00:11:23.200 pass away. Brothers and sisters, a
00:11:25.920 testimony of Jesus Christ was never
00:11:28.000 meant to be a temporary gift. Nothing
00:11:30.880 about it is temporary. Not the giver,
00:11:34.160 not the gift itself, not the deliverer
00:11:36.800 of the gift, not who the gift is about.
00:11:40.560 May your testimony be described in this
00:11:43.440 same way. Though heaven and earth shall
00:11:47.200 pass away, your testimony and witness of
00:11:50.000 the gospel of Jesus Christ will not pass
00:11:53.360 away, now is the time to lay hold on
00:11:58.000 this precious gift in the name of Jesus
00:12:01.760 Christ. Amen.
00:12:03.200 Amen.
