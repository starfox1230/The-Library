00:00:01.120 I express my love for President Russell
00:00:04.319 M. Nelson
00:00:06.799 and my gratefulness
00:00:08.960 for the remarkable influence he has had
00:00:11.200 on each of us.
00:00:13.759 And in all of our names,
00:00:17.119 I thank God for the noble life of
00:00:19.840 President Don H. Oaks.
00:00:25.760 With each passing year, I feel greater
00:00:27.920 love for our Savior Jesus Christ and for
00:00:30.080 his merciful atonement.
00:00:32.719 His supreme sacrifice securing victory
00:00:35.360 over death and sin is the most
00:00:38.320 consequential contribution of all human
00:00:40.719 history.
00:00:42.800 Understanding his divine gift is for me
00:00:46.239 an open-ended heavenly tutorial that
00:00:48.559 will continue beyond the grave.
00:00:51.680 The powerful compassion of the Savior in
00:00:54.000 forgiving sin and in healing the wounds
00:00:56.239 caused by the sins of others
00:00:59.120 is a most miraculous manifestation of
00:01:01.680 the love of God.
00:01:04.000 My desire is to offer hope for those
00:01:07.439 seeking forgiveness for very serious
00:01:09.600 sins
00:01:11.119 and to offer comfort to those seeking
00:01:13.280 healing from the anguishing wounds
00:01:16.080 caused by the serious sins of others.
00:01:19.840 Healing and forgiveness
00:01:22.400 are each found in their fullness in the
00:01:24.400 atoning love of Jesus Christ.
00:01:27.920 If you have committed serious sins and
00:01:31.040 are in the process of or have the desire
00:01:33.439 to fully repent and feel the unspeakable
00:01:36.000 joy of forgiveness,
00:01:38.640 please know this miracle is awaiting
00:01:40.960 you.
00:01:42.320 The Savior continuously calls, "Come
00:01:45.439 unto me."
00:01:48.159 Strengthening your faith in our Savior
00:01:50.320 Jesus Christ will invigorate the
00:01:53.280 yearning of your soul to know him,
00:01:55.920 believe in him, and yield your heart to
00:01:58.719 him. Enus asked about his own
00:02:01.759 forgiveness. Lord, how is it done? The
00:02:05.759 Lord responded, "Because of thy faith in
00:02:09.119 Christ, whom thou hast never before
00:02:11.760 heard nor seen." And Moroni added, "If
00:02:16.080 ye shall deny yourself of all
00:02:17.760 ungodliness and love God with all your
00:02:20.959 might, mind, and strength, then is his
00:02:24.959 grace sufficient for you."
00:02:28.239 Turning from sin, turning toward God,
00:02:31.280 and strengthening your faith in Jesus
00:02:33.360 Christ is a beautiful beginning.
00:02:36.400 Humbly submitting your will to God
00:02:39.519 includes acknowledging serious sins to
00:02:41.920 your bishop or branch president, but
00:02:44.959 your full forgiveness
00:02:47.360 comes from the Savior.
00:02:49.599 Forgiveness is a divine gift offered
00:02:52.400 through the grace of Jesus Christ.
00:02:56.160 A desire to truly return to God is
00:02:59.599 accompanied by the determination
00:03:02.640 to be completely honest with your
00:03:04.480 heavenly father with yourself with those
00:03:07.840 who were harmed and with your priesthood
00:03:10.400 leader.
00:03:12.560 Your heavenly father rejoices in your
00:03:14.800 resolve to come unto him with a broken
00:03:17.440 heart and contrite spirit.
00:03:20.080 Having a contrite spirit is humbly
00:03:22.400 putting yourself in the hands of God.
00:03:25.200 Having a broken heart brings what the
00:03:27.280 Apostle Paul described as godly sorrow,
00:03:30.879 a deep longing of the soul to return to
00:03:33.760 him, whatever the cost.
00:03:38.080 Your yearning leads you to want to
00:03:40.159 repair what you have broken.
00:03:42.959 Yet realizing some things are not in
00:03:45.920 your power to repair, you fervently pray
00:03:49.680 that the Lord through his grace will
00:03:53.360 help heal those who have been hurt in
00:03:55.680 consequence of your actions.
00:03:59.599 The effects of serious sin on others are
00:04:03.200 often painfully difficult to overcome.
00:04:07.760 Are you following the example of the
00:04:09.519 sons of Mosiah
00:04:11.519 who were zealously striving to repair
00:04:13.920 all the injuries which they had done?
00:04:17.199 Speak with those you respect about what
00:04:19.839 you might not be seeing.
00:04:22.560 As I was preparing this talk, I received
00:04:24.880 an unexpected email from someone in the
00:04:27.360 process of repenting and desiring to
00:04:30.160 return to the church. His former wife
00:04:33.520 was still suffering from the loss of
00:04:35.360 their eternal marriage, difficulties
00:04:37.840 with the children, the loss of financial
00:04:40.000 security, not being quite able to keep
00:04:42.080 up with the expenses, and the deeply
00:04:44.880 suffocating feelings of being betrayed.
00:04:48.800 He shared with me how his priesthood
00:04:50.560 leader felt impressed to ask him to
00:04:53.360 prayerfully consider what more he could
00:04:55.919 do for his former wife and children.
00:04:58.880 With permission, I share a part of his
00:05:00.960 email.
00:05:02.800 I first thought the money I gave up in
00:05:04.720 the divorce decree was more than
00:05:06.400 generous, but my branch president
00:05:08.880 encouraged me to fast and pray about it.
00:05:11.919 Initially, I struggled with the idea of
00:05:14.240 further restitution. Since my sins
00:05:17.120 weren't financial, I wondered what a
00:05:19.759 generous restitution truly meant. But I
00:05:22.880 soon realized it wasn't just about
00:05:25.280 money.
00:05:26.639 My priesthood leaders met with my former
00:05:29.120 wife and my children
00:05:31.759 and realized they were still struggling
00:05:33.840 and hadn't healed.
00:05:36.240 My new goal was to move forward with
00:05:38.560 faith. I simply expressed my desire to
00:05:42.560 help with no strings attached.
00:05:46.000 I decided to send my former wife a
00:05:48.320 specific amount per paycheck, which was
00:05:51.039 a significant portion of my net pay.
00:05:54.720 Just before making the first payment,
00:05:57.440 the Lord impressed upon my mind that I
00:05:59.680 needed to pay twice that amount.
00:06:02.639 I've learned that restitution isn't just
00:06:05.039 about money. It's about humbly
00:06:07.680 dedicating my life to the Lord. The
00:06:10.639 money is to help replace what I took
00:06:12.960 from my family due to my poor choices.
00:06:16.000 It's about making and keeping promises
00:06:18.400 without expecting anything in return and
00:06:21.919 helping her not worry about bills so she
00:06:25.919 can seek the spirit.
00:06:29.759 Your efforts to restore what you have
00:06:31.759 broken may have nothing to do with
00:06:33.440 money. But as you humbly counsel with
00:06:36.319 the Lord, you may find there is more you
00:06:39.120 can do.
00:06:41.840 As you seek the Lord's forgiveness, be
00:06:43.759 patient as you wait upon his full
00:06:45.840 approval. Consider this scripture. They
00:06:49.440 humbled themselves in the depths of
00:06:51.360 humility and did cry mightily to God,
00:06:54.479 yay, even all the day long. But the Lord
00:06:58.160 was slow to hear their cry because of
00:07:00.560 their iniquities.
00:07:02.880 Nevertheless, the Lord did hear their
00:07:05.360 cries and began to ease their burdens,
00:07:09.680 and they began to prosper by degrees.
00:07:15.280 Be patient
00:07:17.280 as the Lord gives you his blessing and
00:07:19.919 approval by degrees.
00:07:23.039 In the Lord's time, you will feel his
00:07:25.120 voice telling you, "Let these things
00:07:28.160 trouble you no more." One day, as you
00:07:32.080 continue to turn to the Savior, your
00:07:34.560 heavenly father will take away the guilt
00:07:36.720 from your heart through the merits of
00:07:38.960 his son.
00:07:43.520 For you who have been so unfairly
00:07:45.360 injured by the serious sins of another,
00:07:48.160 I long to share the Savior's love and
00:07:50.639 compassion, his comfort and peace.
00:07:53.520 The sadness you have felt, the
00:07:55.199 heartbreak, the loss, the suffocating
00:07:57.840 feeling of betrayal, the upending of
00:08:00.639 your life as you imagined it to be. I
00:08:03.680 give you my absolute assurance. The
00:08:06.160 Savior knows you and loves you. Reach
00:08:09.440 out to him. He is your comfort and
00:08:12.080 strength. He will send his angels to
00:08:14.879 bear you up.
00:08:16.879 When will your pain be gone, your grief
00:08:19.440 subdued, the unwanted memories
00:08:22.080 forgotten?
00:08:23.759 I do not know. But this I do know. He
00:08:28.479 has the power to bring beauty from ashes
00:08:31.680 of your suffering.
00:08:34.320 Our beloved brothers and sisters in
00:08:36.479 Grand Blank, Michigan, with their
00:08:39.039 undaunted faith in Jesus Christ, with
00:08:41.440 their courage and unselfishness, have
00:08:44.560 and will in the weeks and months ahead
00:08:47.680 abundantly receive of the Savior's
00:08:50.080 incomp incomparable love and grace.
00:08:54.880 And as you continue to place your trust
00:08:57.040 in him,
00:08:59.120 your clouds of darkness and anguish
00:09:01.760 sobbing in the night
00:09:04.080 will be trans will be transferred into
00:09:07.120 cascading tears of joy and peace in the
00:09:10.240 morning light. Your sorrow shall be
00:09:13.040 turned into joy and your joy no one
00:09:16.000 taketh from you. That moment will come.
00:09:20.720 I testify that it will come.
00:09:27.279 The atoning love of Jesus Christ can be
00:09:29.680 found in the most difficult situations,
00:09:32.560 but we all constantly need the atoning
00:09:35.040 grace of our savior. President Don H.
00:09:38.080 Oaks taught, "Because of his atoning
00:09:41.440 experience and mortality, our savior is
00:09:44.640 able to comfort, heal, and strengthen
00:09:47.680 all men and women everywhere.
00:09:50.560 But I believe he does so only for those
00:09:53.519 who seek him and ask for his help. The
00:09:57.920 apostle James taught, "Humble yourself
00:10:00.880 in the sight of the Lord and he shall
00:10:03.360 lift you up." We call we qualify for
00:10:06.800 that blessing when we believe in him and
00:10:10.480 pray for his help.
00:10:14.959 I received permission from my dear
00:10:16.959 friend in Ammeritus General Authority,
00:10:18.880 Elder Robert E. Wells, now 97 years old,
00:10:23.279 to share his experience of more than 60
00:10:26.399 years ago.
00:10:28.079 While living in Paraguay in 1960 and
00:10:31.920 employed as an international banker,
00:10:34.720 Robert Wells, then 32 years old, and his
00:10:38.320 wife Merurl were each a pilot in two
00:10:42.560 different planes flying home from
00:10:44.959 Uruguay to Paraguay.
00:10:47.600 Encountering thick clouds, Robert and
00:10:50.240 Merl lost visual and radio contact with
00:10:52.800 each other. Robert quickly landed where
00:10:56.800 he learned his wife's plane had crashed.
00:11:00.079 Neither his wife nor their two friends
00:11:03.360 flying with her had survived. His
00:11:06.399 children at home in Asunion were ages 7,
00:11:11.200 five, and two.
00:11:13.680 Elder Wells spoke of his grief.
00:11:16.640 Words will forever be inadequate in
00:11:18.880 expressing the pain that swelled within
00:11:20.959 me, consuming my emotions and numbing my
00:11:24.480 senses.
00:11:26.079 Profound tears of sorrow simply wouldn't
00:11:29.040 stop flowing.
00:11:31.120 To make matters worse, as my mind was
00:11:34.240 attempting to deal with the devastating
00:11:36.560 realization of my wife's passing, I
00:11:39.920 found myself experiencing tremendous
00:11:42.720 guilt for feeling I was responsible for
00:11:45.839 the crash.
00:11:48.800 Robert blamed himself for not having had
00:11:50.959 the plane inspected more thoroughly and
00:11:53.760 for not giving his wife better
00:11:55.360 instrument flying instructions.
00:11:57.920 He felt he was guilty of neglect.
00:12:01.600 Robert said, "My mind went into a dark
00:12:04.959 days. I simply existed for the sake of
00:12:08.160 the children, nothing more. I lost my
00:12:11.200 desire to continue on."
00:12:14.160 In time, Robert was blessed with a
00:12:17.120 deeply spiritual experience. He
00:12:19.839 recounted
00:12:21.360 one evening about one year later while
00:12:25.519 on my knees in prayer a miracle
00:12:28.240 occurred.
00:12:29.760 While praying and pleading to my
00:12:31.600 heavenly father, I felt as though the
00:12:34.720 savior came to my side and I heard an
00:12:38.079 audible voice speaking these words to my
00:12:41.760 soul and to my ears.
00:12:44.480 Robert,
00:12:46.160 my atoning sacrifice paid for your sins
00:12:49.040 and your mistakes. Your wife forgives
00:12:52.079 you. Your friends forgive you. I will
00:12:55.440 lift your burden.
00:12:59.040 From that moment, the burden of guilt
00:13:01.120 and despair was amazingly lifted from
00:13:03.360 me. I had been rescued. I immediately
00:13:06.800 understood the encompassing power of the
00:13:08.880 Savior's atonement and that it applied
00:13:11.519 directly to me.
00:13:13.600 I experienced light and joy like I had
00:13:16.800 never before known. I had been given an
00:13:20.160 unearned gift, the Lord's gift of grace.
00:13:24.160 I didn't deserve it. I had done nothing
00:13:26.959 to merit it, but he gave it to me
00:13:30.160 nonetheless.
00:13:32.880 Brothers and sisters,
00:13:35.200 may we each be sanctified in Christ by
00:13:37.920 the grace of God through the shedding of
00:13:40.639 the blood of Christ. becoming holy
00:13:43.680 without spot.
00:13:45.680 I testify of the love, the mercy, and
00:13:49.279 the grace of our savior and redeemer. He
00:13:52.399 lives. We are his. We are children of
00:13:55.839 the covenant. As we believe in him,
00:13:59.440 follow him, and trust him, he will lift
00:14:02.959 us from our sorrows and our sins.
00:14:06.880 Then beyond this mortal life in our
00:14:10.720 father's house, we will live with him
00:14:14.320 forever and ever. In the name of Jesus
00:14:17.680 Christ. Amen.
