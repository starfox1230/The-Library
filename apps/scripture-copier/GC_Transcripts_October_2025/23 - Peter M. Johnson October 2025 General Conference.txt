00:00:00.960 Sisters and brothers, thank you for your
00:00:03.679 faithful devotion in coming unto Jesus
00:00:06.240 Christ during these challenging times.
00:00:08.880 You are wonderful. You are beautiful.
00:00:11.840 You are each a child of God. It is my
00:00:14.880 prayer that we recognize the influence
00:00:16.560 of the Holy Ghost as we become and help
00:00:19.600 one another become true disciples, truly
00:00:23.680 devoted disciples of Jesus Christ and
00:00:26.000 feel of his joy as we worship in the
00:00:27.760 house of the Lord. President Russell M.
00:00:30.320 Nelson declared, "Now is the time for
00:00:32.960 you and for me to prepare for the second
00:00:35.040 coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus the
00:00:37.600 Christ. Now is the time for us to make
00:00:40.160 our disciplehip our highest priority in
00:00:43.840 a world filled with dizzying
00:00:45.520 distractions. How can we do this?"
00:00:48.399 President Nelson provided the answer.
00:00:50.960 Regular worship in the temple will help
00:00:53.280 us. In the house of the Lord, we focus
00:00:55.760 on Jesus Christ. We come to know him.
00:00:58.719 Every sincere seeker of Jesus Christ
00:01:00.879 will find him in the temple. So how do
00:01:04.080 we become and help one another become
00:01:06.640 devoted disciples of Jesus Christ? We
00:01:09.439 minister to the one. Ministering in the
00:01:12.320 Savior's way involves love without
00:01:14.320 judgment, compassion, kindness, and
00:01:17.040 patient. As we minister to the one, we
00:01:19.920 invite the one to come into Christ and
00:01:22.400 to worship in the house of the Lord, to
00:01:24.799 receive of his redeeming power.
00:01:28.320 In other words, we help one another
00:01:30.240 become devoted disciples as we minister
00:01:32.720 to the one in ways that lead to the
00:01:35.360 house of the Lord. We learn from Jesus
00:01:38.880 Christ the power of ministering to the
00:01:40.640 one with love and without judgment. You
00:01:43.759 remember the Samaritan woman at the
00:01:45.920 well? This woman may have felt
00:01:48.079 unimportant, alone, discouraged, and
00:01:51.200 unseen. She may have felt she did not
00:01:53.759 belong. Throughout her life, she had
00:01:56.000 five husbands, and the man who she was
00:01:58.320 living with was not her husband. Others
00:02:01.439 may have imposed unrighteous judgment
00:02:03.520 without knowing her life's
00:02:04.640 circumstances. This may be one of the
00:02:07.360 reasons she came to the well alone in
00:02:10.160 the hottest part of the day. And yet she
00:02:13.280 was one of the first to whom Jesus
00:02:14.879 Christ declared he was the Messiah. To
00:02:18.400 him this woman was a daughter of God.
00:02:22.000 Jesus taught that woman that through him
00:02:24.560 one can receive eternal life partaking
00:02:26.879 of the living water. He declared,
00:02:28.879 "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I
00:02:30.959 shall give shall never thirst, but the
00:02:33.200 water that I shall give shall be a well
00:02:34.879 of water springing up to everlasting
00:02:36.720 life."
00:02:37.840 The woman of Samaria felt the the
00:02:40.160 Savior's love and received the witness
00:02:42.480 through the spirit that he is the
00:02:44.480 Messiah. After this witness, she
00:02:47.280 returned to the city, invited others to
00:02:49.920 come and see, and many believe Jesus is
00:02:52.720 indeed the Christ, the savior of the
00:02:54.560 world. Christ ministered to the one with
00:02:57.360 love, and as a result, others became his
00:03:00.959 devoted disciples. We learn of the power
00:03:03.920 of ministering to the one with
00:03:05.120 compassion from Christ's apostles Peter
00:03:07.360 and John. You remember a certain man
00:03:11.200 laying from birth laid daily at the gate
00:03:12.959 of the temple asking for money. This man
00:03:16.239 may have felt unimportant, alone,
00:03:19.599 discouraged and unseen. He may have felt
00:03:23.040 he did not belong. Then Peter said,
00:03:26.319 "Silver and gold have I none, but such
00:03:28.959 as I have I give unto thee. In the name
00:03:31.519 of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and
00:03:34.239 walk. Peter took the man by his right
00:03:37.040 hand, lifted him up, and the man was
00:03:39.519 made whole. Immediately following the
00:03:42.000 miracle, the man entered into the temple
00:03:45.280 with Peter and John, walking and leaping
00:03:49.840 and praising God. Peter and John
00:03:53.440 ministered to the one in ways that led
00:03:55.440 to the house of the Lord. And this man
00:03:58.080 became Christ's devoted disciple.
00:04:01.599 My friends, there has been moments in my
00:04:04.239 life where I too have felt unimportant,
00:04:07.680 alone, discouraged, and unseen.
00:04:11.360 I have felt as if I did not belong. I
00:04:14.879 was baptized and confirmed a member of
00:04:16.560 the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
00:04:18.238 Saints when I was 19 years old. One year
00:04:20.880 later, I accepted a call to serve as a
00:04:22.720 full-time missionary, but there was much
00:04:24.800 I had not yet learned about church
00:04:26.639 history. Early in my missionary service,
00:04:29.759 I learned that there was a period that
00:04:31.199 those of black African descent were not
00:04:33.520 allowed to enjoy all of the blessings of
00:04:35.520 worshiping in a house of the Lord.
00:04:37.919 Learning this for the first time brought
00:04:40.720 feelings of anger, confusion, doubt, and
00:04:44.720 fear. These feelings were so intense
00:04:47.199 that my ability to recognize the Holy
00:04:49.280 Ghost was lost for a season.
00:04:52.320 Fortunately, I had a wonderful
00:04:54.080 missionary companion, Kevin Vic, who
00:04:56.479 ministered to me with love, patience,
00:04:58.560 and kindness. Each night, as he
00:05:00.880 witnessed my feelings of doubt, and
00:05:02.479 uncertainty, he would simply say to the
00:05:05.280 younger Elder Johnson, "I love you."
00:05:08.720 After about two weeks, I allowed myself
00:05:11.440 to feel of Kevin's love. I gained the
00:05:14.160 courage to pray to Heavenly Father in
00:05:15.840 the name of Jesus Christ. And as I
00:05:18.160 prayed, I was drawn to section six of
00:05:21.039 the Doctrine of Covenants, verses 21-
00:05:23.120 24, which states, "Behold, I am Jesus
00:05:26.880 Christ, the Son of God. I am the light
00:05:29.440 which shine upth in darkness. Cast your
00:05:31.680 mind upon the night that you cried unto
00:05:33.440 me in your heart, that you might know
00:05:35.600 concerning the truth of these things,
00:05:37.759 that I speak peace to your mind
00:05:39.680 concerning the matter. What greater
00:05:42.000 witness can you have than from God?" As
00:05:45.759 I read, I remembered. I remember the day
00:05:49.280 that I have fasted and prayed to know
00:05:50.960 that the Book of Mormon is the word of
00:05:53.280 God and that Joseph Smith is the prophet
00:05:56.320 of the restoration. I remember covenants
00:05:58.960 made in the house of the Lord that
00:06:00.720 connect me to Jesus Christ in such a
00:06:02.479 personal and intimate way. I felt of the
00:06:05.440 Savior's love, his mercy, and of his
00:06:08.560 assurance that the church of Jesus
00:06:10.240 Christ of Latter-day Saints is his
00:06:12.560 kingdom upon the earth and is necessary
00:06:15.520 to prepare us for his second coming.
00:06:18.880 Because I remembered, I again was able
00:06:21.840 to recognize the Holy Ghost and to
00:06:23.520 understand more fully that Jesus is the
00:06:26.400 Christ and I am his disciple.
00:06:30.319 At times we will have unanswered
00:06:32.960 questions and feelings of being
00:06:35.680 unimportant,
00:06:37.199 discouraged, alone and unseen. However,
00:06:41.039 my friends, we must press forward with
00:06:43.520 faith in Jesus Christ and remember his
00:06:46.639 words.
00:06:48.319 Let not your heart be troubled. In the
00:06:50.800 world, ye shall have tribulations, but
00:06:53.680 be of good cheer. I have overcome the
00:06:56.960 world. I am a witness to this reality
00:07:00.560 and of the Savior's promised blessing.
00:07:03.919 So what can we do to ensure our
00:07:06.880 ministering to the one in the Savior's
00:07:08.800 way is most effective?
00:07:11.599 Living the doctrine of Christ will help
00:07:14.000 us. Living the doctrine of Christ, as
00:07:16.400 President Nelson described, can produce
00:07:18.560 the most powerful virtuous cycle,
00:07:21.120 creating spiritual momentum in our lives
00:07:23.680 as we strive to live the higher laws of
00:07:26.160 Jesus Christ. The Savior lifts us up
00:07:29.440 above the pole of this Poland world by
00:07:32.160 blessing us with greater charity,
00:07:34.240 humility, generosity, kindness,
00:07:36.639 self-discipline, peace, and rest. This
00:07:40.880 spiritual momentum produced by living
00:07:43.759 the doctrine of Christ, Elder Dell G.
00:07:46.479 Ran explains not only powers the
00:07:49.280 transformation of our divine nature into
00:07:51.919 our eternal destiny but also motivates
00:07:54.639 us to help to minister to others in
00:07:57.360 appropriate ways. Elder Ran reminds us
00:08:01.039 that the savior job is to heal to make
00:08:04.720 us whole. Our job is to love and to
00:08:08.560 minister in such a way that others are
00:08:10.879 drawn to Jesus Christ. Our ability to
00:08:14.639 live the doctrine of Christ will be
00:08:17.360 enhanced by daily study of the Book of
00:08:19.759 Mormon and weekly partaking of the
00:08:21.919 sacrament. President Nelson declared
00:08:24.639 that the Book of Mormon teaches the
00:08:26.319 doctrine of Christ and provides the most
00:08:28.400 fullest and most clearest understanding
00:08:30.319 of the atonement of Jesus Christ to be
00:08:32.958 found anywhere.
00:08:36.320 I love this book.
00:08:40.399 And prayerfully
00:08:42.159 partaking of the ordinance of the
00:08:43.599 sacraments each week will increase our
00:08:46.080 understanding of the atonement of Jesus
00:08:48.080 Christ and provide spiritual renewal,
00:08:50.800 comfort, and the power of godliness in
00:08:53.120 our lives. Remember in the ordinances of
00:08:56.959 the priesthood, the power of godliness
00:08:59.519 is manifest. And this power which comes
00:09:02.399 from Jesus Christ strengthens our desire
00:09:05.360 and our ability to minister to the one.
00:09:09.200 My study of the Book of Mormon and
00:09:11.920 partaking of the sacrament minimizes
00:09:14.720 feelings of discouragement escalates my
00:09:17.680 determination to minister to the one in
00:09:20.560 the Savior's way and helps make
00:09:22.959 disciplehip my highest priority.
00:09:26.880 My friends, I promise that as we live
00:09:30.480 the doctrine of Christ and minister to
00:09:32.880 the one in ways that lead to the house
00:09:35.040 of the Lord, we will press forward with
00:09:37.760 faith in Jesus Christ even amid
00:09:40.399 unanswered questions and feelings of
00:09:42.959 being unimportant, alone, discouraged,
00:09:46.560 and unseen. We will invite the one to
00:09:49.440 come unto Jesus Christ and to worship in
00:09:51.760 the house of the Lord to receive of his
00:09:54.480 redeeming power and love. In the house
00:09:57.760 of the Lord, we will feel the Savior's
00:10:00.640 mercy. We will find answers to our most
00:10:03.600 vexing questions and we will better
00:10:06.240 comprehend the joy of his gospel. In the
00:10:10.240 name of Jesus Christ, amen. Amen.
