00:00:00.880 While the Savior was traveling through
00:00:02.879 Bethesda, some individuals brought a
00:00:05.359 blind man to him. Perhaps they were
00:00:08.559 hoping to see a miracle firsthand.
00:00:11.440 The Savior took the blind man by the
00:00:13.519 hand and led him out of the town to heal
00:00:16.560 him privately.
00:00:18.480 Initially, the healing seemed less than
00:00:20.480 effective. The blind man looked up and
00:00:22.800 said, "I see men as trees walking."
00:00:26.240 Jesus compassionately put his hands
00:00:29.519 again upon his eyes and made him look
00:00:32.800 up. With that additional touch, the
00:00:36.239 blind man now saw clearly.
00:00:39.440 This is just one example of how the
00:00:41.600 Savior's life is characterized by humble
00:00:44.399 acts of service. He reminds us that he
00:00:47.920 came not to be ministered unto but to
00:00:50.640 minister and then invites us to follow
00:00:53.520 his example by going the extra mile,
00:00:56.719 giving to those who ask of us and loving
00:00:59.280 our neighbor. When asked, "Who is my
00:01:02.640 neighbor?" Christ shared the parable of
00:01:05.438 the good Samaritan with a charge to go
00:01:09.200 and do thou likewise.
00:01:12.320 Missionaries of the Church of Jesus
00:01:14.320 Christ of Latter-day Saints are
00:01:16.320 modern-day examples of the Good
00:01:18.159 Samaritan that Christ invites us to
00:01:20.560 become.
00:01:22.080 I would like to highlight those
00:01:23.759 missionaries who are called to service
00:01:25.439 assignments. They are examples to us of
00:01:28.400 how service one open hearts opens hearts
00:01:31.680 to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Two
00:01:34.640 allows all of us to minister regardless
00:01:36.799 of our circumstances. and three brings
00:01:40.000 the power of Christ into our lives.
00:01:43.119 First, service opens hearts to the
00:01:45.759 gospel of Jesus Christ. In about 91 BC,
00:01:50.399 Ammon, a Book of Mormon missionary,
00:01:53.119 introduced himself to King Lemoni by
00:01:55.280 saying, "I desire to dwell among this
00:01:57.840 people for a time, and I will be thy
00:02:00.079 servant."
00:02:01.920 Because of his service to the king,
00:02:04.240 Ammon was granted an opportunity to
00:02:06.479 speak boldly and tell King Lemoni by
00:02:09.038 what power he had performed his service.
00:02:12.000 In return, the king promised that
00:02:14.080 whatsoever Ammon desireest, the king
00:02:16.640 would grant it. Ammon's only request was
00:02:20.160 that the king listen to the message of
00:02:22.160 the gospel of Jesus Christ. Ammon's
00:02:24.959 service resulted in thousands of souls
00:02:27.120 brought to repentance.
00:02:29.440 In our day, service continues to lead
00:02:32.239 others to the gospel. Sister Beavenon
00:02:35.040 was serving as a teaching missionary
00:02:36.640 when she began experiencing health
00:02:38.400 issues, requir requiring her to return
00:02:41.200 home for treatment. Instead of being
00:02:43.920 released, she was able to continue
00:02:46.000 serving as a service missionary from
00:02:47.840 home. While visiting a park, Sister
00:02:50.640 Beavenon and a friend were prompted to
00:02:52.400 talk to a mother with four young
00:02:54.239 children, but they hesitated and the
00:02:56.720 family drove away. The next day, they
00:02:59.519 returned to the park, praying that this
00:03:02.000 family would be there. Miraculously, the
00:03:05.120 mother was sitting in the exact same
00:03:07.519 spot as the day before. This time,
00:03:11.040 Sister Beavenon and her friend
00:03:12.319 approached the mother, got to know her,
00:03:14.560 and discovered that she was in desperate
00:03:16.800 need of temporal help. This provided
00:03:19.680 they provided assistance and then
00:03:22.480 invited her to learn about the gospel.
00:03:25.840 Because of that service and invitation,
00:03:29.040 the mother and her oldest child were
00:03:31.200 baptized, followed by followed by the
00:03:33.920 next oldest a year later. They remained
00:03:36.319 active members today. Sister Beavenon
00:03:39.040 knew this experience was divinely
00:03:41.360 inspired and it proved to her that she
00:03:44.159 was exactly where God needed her to be.
00:03:47.840 Like Ammon and Sister Beavenon, as we
00:03:50.400 serve others, we show forth good
00:03:52.480 examples unto them, and they desire to
00:03:54.959 know the reason of the hope that is in
00:03:56.720 us. Jesus invites us to go and do thou
00:04:01.280 likewise.
00:04:03.280 Second, service allows all of us to
00:04:05.680 minister regardless of our
00:04:07.040 circumstances. President Russell M.
00:04:09.519 Nelson called on every worthy able young
00:04:12.799 man to prepare for and serve a mission
00:04:15.280 and for every able young sister to pray
00:04:17.839 to know if the Lord would have her serve
00:04:19.600 a mission. He promised that quote your
00:04:22.880 decision to serve a mission whether a
00:04:25.040 proceliting or a service mission will
00:04:27.600 bless you and many others unquote.
00:04:30.720 Service missions changed the definition
00:04:33.759 of the word able.
00:04:36.160 Now, every worth the young man and woman
00:04:38.560 who desires to serve a full-time mission
00:04:40.639 for the Lord can do so with very few
00:04:43.040 exceptions.
00:04:44.800 Elder Holgado is an example of being
00:04:47.199 able to serve regardless of personal
00:04:49.120 circumstances. He was born with a rare
00:04:51.840 genetic disorder which precluded him
00:04:54.000 from serving a teaching mission. Elder
00:04:56.720 Hogado was called as a service
00:04:58.639 missionary and volunteered in the
00:05:00.560 bishop's storehouse where he helped
00:05:02.639 others get the assistance they needed.
00:05:05.040 He stocked shelves, bagged vegetables,
00:05:07.759 and crushed cardboard boxes. As Elder
00:05:10.560 Halgado spoke in sacrament meeting after
00:05:12.720 his mission, he he shared that quote,
00:05:15.919 "God needs service missionaries. He
00:05:18.639 needs people to love and serve others.
00:05:20.800 These people stock toilet paper, bag
00:05:23.120 broccoli, build furniture, and are good
00:05:25.680 to people."
00:05:27.759 You don't need to have a service
00:05:29.280 assignment or wear a name tag to do
00:05:31.039 good. Every act of service is recognized
00:05:34.080 by the Savior. We are all able to help
00:05:36.880 others come under Christ by serving with
00:05:38.880 loving kindness. We can all minister in
00:05:41.440 Christ's name to the one through the
00:05:43.280 power of the Holy Ghost and live as
00:05:45.600 examples of faith in Jesus Christ.
00:05:48.560 Service allows us to pre present
00:05:50.880 ourselves as living sacrifices who are
00:05:54.160 acceptable to God.
00:05:56.479 Jesus invites us to go and do thou
00:05:59.280 likewise.
00:06:00.960 Third, service brings the power of
00:06:03.199 Christ into our lives. A young
00:06:05.280 missionary who transferred from a
00:06:06.800 teaching assignment to a service
00:06:08.240 assignment struggled with some personal
00:06:10.160 challenges that left him needing
00:06:12.160 Christ's healing power. Consecrated
00:06:14.720 service brought that power into his
00:06:16.479 life. He said, "I felt that when I was
00:06:19.199 struggling, I could feel Christ lifting
00:06:20.960 me up. There is something special about
00:06:23.440 seeing him bless people through a food
00:06:25.680 pantry, in the temple, and through his
00:06:28.160 gospel." This elder began to feel deeper
00:06:31.120 joy and his newfound enthusiasm blessed
00:06:34.000 him and his entire family. The spirit
00:06:37.199 entered their home more abundantly. They
00:06:39.520 attended the temple together more
00:06:41.039 regularly and Christ became a greater
00:06:43.360 focus in their family.
00:06:46.160 This missionary believes that Christ
00:06:48.080 saved his life and blessed his family
00:06:50.400 through service. President Nelson
00:06:52.639 taught, "Willingness to serve and
00:06:54.639 strengthen others stands as a symbol of
00:06:56.960 one's readiness to be healed by the
00:06:58.960 redemptive power of the Savior. Christ
00:07:01.680 invites us to go and do thou likewise."
00:07:05.759 Service missionaries are examples of
00:07:08.160 consecrated disciples of Jesus Christ.
00:07:10.880 When your family member is blessed with
00:07:12.800 a call as a service missionary, that is
00:07:15.520 a moment to celebrate. Your family will
00:07:18.479 have a set aart representative of Jesus
00:07:20.960 Christ living in your home. That will
00:07:23.599 change all of you for the good. There
00:07:26.000 should be no disappointment in any call
00:07:27.759 to serve. We sing, "I'll go where you
00:07:30.639 want me to go and I'll be what you want
00:07:32.880 me to be." Here is an opportunity to
00:07:35.440 show that we really mean what we say.
00:07:38.720 To all of you who serve, and especially
00:07:41.520 to the over 4,000 young service
00:07:43.680 missionaries, we love you. If teaching
00:07:47.280 missionaries are the Lord's mouth, then
00:07:49.440 service missionaries are the Lord's
00:07:51.039 hands. And you are not secondass
00:07:54.720 missionaries.
00:07:56.639 Each of you is vital to the gathering of
00:08:00.160 Israel. President Nelson taught that
00:08:02.720 anytime we do anything that helps anyone
00:08:06.560 to make and keep their covenants with
00:08:08.319 God, we are helping to gather Israel.
00:08:11.039 You service missionaries gather Israel
00:08:13.039 in so many ways and your service changes
00:08:15.599 lives. Often you don't know who the
00:08:17.919 beneficiary of your service is. But God
00:08:21.039 knows. Always remember that in as much
00:08:24.080 as you serve one of the least of these,
00:08:26.479 ye serve him. We hear your voices as you
00:08:30.479 volunteer at church call centers. We see
00:08:33.360 your smiles as you help in community
00:08:35.360 organizations. And we feel your light as
00:08:38.799 you serve in temples. You feed the
00:08:41.120 hungry, clothe the naked, and give drink
00:08:43.919 to the thirsty. We all need to go and do
00:08:47.680 likewise.
00:08:49.519 Service is the lifeblood of disciples of
00:08:52.480 Christ. Service has the power to open
00:08:55.200 hearts to the gospel and allows all of
00:08:57.920 us to give our whole soul to Christ. It
00:09:01.200 changes our hearts to become more like
00:09:03.120 him and in the process we lift others.
00:09:07.200 President Nelson once asked, "In this
00:09:09.760 world smitten with spiritual decay, can
00:09:12.560 individuals make a difference?" His
00:09:14.720 answer, "Yes." The covenant people of
00:09:18.000 the Lord, armed with power of with the
00:09:20.320 power of God in great glory, can lift
00:09:23.279 the lives of all humankind.
00:09:25.920 Through service, we change hearts and
00:09:29.279 the world.
00:09:31.519 Christ went about doing good. He
00:09:35.519 ministered to the sick, gave sight to
00:09:38.080 the blind, and visited the downtrodden.
00:09:42.240 He cooked meals, helped at wedding
00:09:44.720 feasts, and fed thousands who are
00:09:47.200 hungry.
00:09:48.959 As we serve in Christ's name to the one,
00:09:51.920 we become increasingly holy and worthy
00:09:54.800 of the gift of eternal life. Jesus
00:09:57.600 Christ lives. He is my savior and yours.
00:10:01.760 He is our redeemer. He is our great
00:10:04.640 example of ministering. I invite each of
00:10:07.920 us to go and do likewise in the name of
00:10:12.240 Jesus Christ. Amen.
