00:00:00.880 President Russell M. Nelson has taught
00:00:02.800 that if the Lord were speaking to us
00:00:04.480 directly, the first thing he would make
00:00:06.720 sure we understand is our true identity.
00:00:09.360 We are children of God, children of the
00:00:11.840 covenant, and disciples of Jesus Christ.
00:00:15.280 Any other designation will ultimately
00:00:17.440 let us down. I learned this for myself
00:00:20.240 when my oldest son received his first
00:00:21.920 cell phone. With great excitement, he
00:00:24.480 began entering the names of his family
00:00:26.240 and friends into his contacts. One day I
00:00:29.119 noticed his mom was calling. On the
00:00:31.840 screen appeared the name Mother.
00:00:35.600 That was a sensible and dignified choice
00:00:37.920 and I'll admit a sign of respect for the
00:00:40.800 better parent in our home.
00:00:43.680 Naturally, I got curious. What name had
00:00:46.320 he given me?
00:00:48.719 I scrolled through his contacts,
00:00:50.320 assuming that if Wendy was mother, I
00:00:53.520 must be father.
00:00:56.320 Not there.
00:00:58.000 I searched for dad. Still nothing. My
00:01:01.199 curiosity turned into mild concern.
00:01:05.680 Does he call me Corey?
00:01:08.240 No. In a lastditch effort, I thought,
00:01:11.600 "Okay, we're soccer players. Maybe he
00:01:13.920 calls me Pelle."
00:01:17.200 Wishful thinking.
00:01:19.520 Finally, I called his number myself and
00:01:21.600 two words popped up on his screen. Not
00:01:25.040 mother.
00:01:33.920 Brothers and sisters,
00:01:36.720 by which name are you called?
00:01:41.360 Jesus called his followers by many
00:01:43.600 names. disciples, sons and daughters,
00:01:47.680 children of the prophets, sheep,
00:01:51.040 friends, the light of the world, saints.
00:01:55.920 Each carries eternal significance and
00:01:58.159 underscores a personal relationship with
00:02:00.799 the Savior.
00:02:02.640 But among these names, one rises above
00:02:05.680 the rest, the name of Christ.
00:02:09.758 In the Book of Mormon, King Benjamin
00:02:11.680 powerfully taught, "There is no other
00:02:14.160 name given whereby salvation cometh.
00:02:16.879 Therefore, I would that ye should take
00:02:19.120 upon you the name of Christ. And it
00:02:22.000 shall come to pass that whosoever doeth
00:02:24.239 this shall be found at the right hand of
00:02:26.400 God. For he shall know the name by which
00:02:29.280 he is called, for he shall be called by
00:02:32.560 the name of Christ." Those who take upon
00:02:36.879 themselves the name of Christ become his
00:02:38.879 disciples and witnesses. In the book of
00:02:41.440 Acts, we read that after the
00:02:43.120 resurrection of Jesus Christ, chosen
00:02:45.519 witnesses were commanded to testify that
00:02:47.840 whosoever believed in Jesus was baptized
00:02:51.280 and received the Holy Ghost would
00:02:53.599 receive a remission of sins. Those who
00:02:58.000 received these sacred ordinances
00:02:59.760 assembled with the church, became
00:03:01.760 disciples, and were called Christians.
00:03:05.840 The Book of Mormon also describes
00:03:07.599 believers in Christ as Christians and
00:03:10.879 covenant people as the children of
00:03:13.760 Christ, his sons and his daughters.
00:03:18.480 What does it mean to be called by the
00:03:20.319 name of Christ? It means making and
00:03:22.640 keeping covenants, always remembering
00:03:25.120 him, keeping his commandments, and being
00:03:27.920 willing to stand as witnesses of God at
00:03:30.560 all times and in all things. It means
00:03:34.000 standing with prophets and apostles as
00:03:36.560 they carry Christ's message across the
00:03:38.400 world with its doctrine, covenants, and
00:03:41.440 ordinances.
00:03:43.360 It also means serving others to relieve
00:03:46.640 suffering, to be a light, and to bring
00:03:49.680 hope in Christ to all people.
00:03:53.599 Of course, this is a lifelong pursuit.
00:03:57.280 The prophet Joseph Smith taught that
00:04:00.000 this is a station to which no man ever
00:04:03.760 arrived in a moment.
00:04:07.120 Because the journey of disciplehip takes
00:04:09.200 time and effort built line upon line,
00:04:11.920 precept upon precept, it's easy to get
00:04:14.799 caught up in worldly titles. These only
00:04:18.160 yield temporary value and will never be
00:04:21.358 enough on their own. Redemption and the
00:04:24.960 things of eternity only cometh in and
00:04:28.560 through the Holy Messiah.
00:04:31.520 Therefore, following prophetic counsel
00:04:34.800 to make disciplehip a priority is both
00:04:37.440 timely and wise, especially in an age of
00:04:41.280 so many competing voices and influences.
00:04:45.360 This was at the heart of King Benjamin's
00:04:47.280 council when he said,"I would that ye
00:04:49.919 should remember to retain the name of
00:04:51.520 Christ written always in your hearts
00:04:54.720 that ye hear and know the voice by which
00:04:59.280 ye shall be called and also the name by
00:05:03.199 which he shall call you."
00:05:06.479 I've seen this in my own family. My
00:05:09.199 great-grandfather, Martin Gosner, was
00:05:11.600 changed forever because a humble branch
00:05:13.520 president answered the Savior's call. In
00:05:16.720 Germany in 1909, times were tough and
00:05:19.199 money was tight. Martin worked as a
00:05:21.440 welder in a pipe manufacturing plant. By
00:05:24.080 his own admission, most paydays ended in
00:05:26.560 drinking, smoking, and buying rounds at
00:05:28.720 the pub. His wife finally warned him
00:05:31.600 that if he didn't change, she would
00:05:34.080 leave.
00:05:35.759 One day, Martin's coworker met him on
00:05:37.680 the way to the pub with a crumpled
00:05:39.440 religious booklet in his hand. He had
00:05:42.080 found it on the street and told Martin
00:05:43.919 that he felt something different after
00:05:45.680 reading the pamphlet entitled Vas Visi
00:05:48.560 Fond MON
00:05:50.560 or what do you know about the Mormons?
00:05:54.080 I'm certain that title has changed.
00:05:58.560 An address stamped on the back was just
00:06:00.800 legible enough to decipher where the
00:06:02.639 church was located. It was a
00:06:04.960 considerable distance away, but they
00:06:06.560 were moved by what they read and decided
00:06:08.400 to take the train that Sunday to
00:06:10.000 investigate. When they arrived, they
00:06:12.880 found that the address was not the
00:06:14.560 church they expected, but a funeral
00:06:16.560 home. Martin hesitated because really, a
00:06:21.440 church in a funeral home sounded a
00:06:23.759 little too much like a package deal.
00:06:28.720 But upstairs in a rented hall, they
00:06:31.199 found a small group of saints. A man
00:06:33.680 invited them to a testimony meeting.
00:06:35.840 Martin was touched by the spirit and so
00:06:37.919 impressed by the simple, fervent
00:06:39.759 testimonies that he bore his testimony.
00:06:43.919 And it was there in that most unlikely
00:06:46.560 place that he said he already knew it
00:06:50.240 must be true.
00:06:52.319 Afterward, the man introduced himself as
00:06:54.319 the branch president and asked if they
00:06:56.560 would return. Martin explained that he
00:06:58.960 lived too far away and couldn't afford
00:07:01.360 the weekly trip. The branch president
00:07:03.840 simply said, "Follow me." They walked a
00:07:07.039 few blocks to a nearby factory where the
00:07:09.440 branch president's friend worked. After
00:07:11.440 a short conversation, Martin and his
00:07:13.599 friend were both offered jobs. Then, the
00:07:16.720 branch president led them to an
00:07:18.160 apartment building and secured housing
00:07:20.000 for their families.
00:07:22.000 All of this happened within two hours.
00:07:25.599 Martin's family moved the following
00:07:27.440 week. Six months later, they were
00:07:29.599 baptized. The man once known as a
00:07:32.319 hopeless drunk became so ardent in his
00:07:35.039 new faith that people in town began
00:07:37.120 calling him perhaps no not so
00:07:39.440 affectionately the priest.
00:07:42.960 As for the branch president, I cannot
00:07:45.360 tell you his name. His identity has been
00:07:47.919 lost to time. But I call him a disciple,
00:07:51.599 ambassador, Christian, good Samaritan
00:07:55.680 and friend. His influence is still felt
00:07:59.680 116 years later. And I stand on the
00:08:03.360 shoulders of his disciplehip.
00:08:06.319 There is a saying that you can count the
00:08:08.160 seeds in an apple, but you can't count
00:08:10.319 the apples that come from one seed. The
00:08:12.879 seed planted by the branch president has
00:08:14.879 produced countless fruit. Little would
00:08:17.840 he have known that 48 years later,
00:08:20.720 several generations of Martin's family
00:08:22.639 on both sides of the veil would be
00:08:24.720 sealed in the Ban Switzerland temple.
00:08:28.400 Perhaps the greatest sermons are the
00:08:30.160 ones we never hear, but those we see in
00:08:32.719 the quiet, unassuming actions and deeds
00:08:35.120 observed in the lives of ordinary people
00:08:37.200 who, trying to be like Jesus, go about
00:08:41.360 doing good. What this gracious branch
00:08:44.480 president did was not part of a
00:08:46.000 checklist. He was simply living the
00:08:48.160 gospel as described in the book of Alma.
00:08:51.760 They did not send any away that were
00:08:54.480 hungry or that were a thirst or that
00:08:57.279 were sick. They were liberal to all,
00:08:59.600 both old and young, both male and
00:09:02.080 female.
00:09:03.680 And a point we should not overlook.
00:09:07.760 They did not send away any, whether out
00:09:10.480 of the church or in the church. Those
00:09:15.279 who take upon themselves the name of
00:09:17.120 Christ recognize as Joseph Smith said,
00:09:19.839 "A man filled with the love of God is
00:09:21.760 not content with blessing his family
00:09:23.279 alone, but ranges through the whole
00:09:25.040 world, anxious to bless the whole human
00:09:28.080 race."
00:09:29.600 This is how Jesus lived. In fact, he did
00:09:32.959 so much that his disciples couldn't
00:09:34.959 write it all down. The apostle John
00:09:37.440 recorded, "There are also many other
00:09:39.519 things which Jesus did the which if they
00:09:42.160 should be written everyone I suppose
00:09:44.560 that even the world itself could not
00:09:46.240 contain the books that should be
00:09:48.080 written."
00:09:49.600 Let us strive to follow Christ's example
00:09:51.760 doing good and making disciplehip a
00:09:54.480 lifelong priority so that each time we
00:09:56.800 interact with others they will feel
00:09:59.360 God's love and the confirming power of
00:10:03.200 the Holy Ghost. Then we may join my
00:10:06.240 great-grandfather and millions of others
00:10:07.920 who have declared like the disciple
00:10:10.080 Andrew, we have found the Messiah.
00:10:14.320 In the end, our identity isn't defined
00:10:17.120 by the world, but our disciplehip is
00:10:20.560 defined by the ordinances we receive,
00:10:23.279 the covenants we keep, and the love we
00:10:25.519 show to God and neighbor by simply doing
00:10:27.680 good. As President Nelson taught, we are
00:10:30.800 indeed children of God, children of the
00:10:33.120 covenant, disciples of Jesus Christ. I
00:10:36.320 testify that Jesus Christ lives and has
00:10:38.320 redeemed us. He is the one who said, "I
00:10:41.040 have called thee by name, thou art
00:10:44.000 mine." In the name of Jesus Christ,
00:10:46.640 amen.
00:10:47.440 Amen.
