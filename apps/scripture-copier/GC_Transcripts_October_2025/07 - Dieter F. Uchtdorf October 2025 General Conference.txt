00:00:00.719 Thank you, choir.
00:00:03.439 Thank you,
00:00:05.359 President Oaks.
00:00:07.759 We love and sustain you and we join you
00:00:12.320 in your heartfelt expressions of love
00:00:15.120 and admiration for our dear President
00:00:18.880 Russell and Nelson and his family.
00:00:23.039 Last year during a trip to Europe,
00:00:26.800 I visited my old place of employment,
00:00:29.359 Lufanza German Airlines at the Frankfurt
00:00:31.840 airport.
00:00:34.000 To train its pilots, they operate
00:00:35.920 several sophisticated full motion flight
00:00:38.960 simulators that can recreate almost any
00:00:42.320 normal and emergency flight condition.
00:00:44.800 During my many years as an airline
00:00:46.719 captain, I had to pass a check flight in
00:00:48.960 the flight simulator every six months.
00:00:51.600 to keep my pilot license current. I
00:00:55.039 remember well those intense moments of
00:00:58.960 stress and anxiety,
00:01:01.280 but also the feeling of accomplishment
00:01:04.799 after passing the test. Back then, I was
00:01:08.080 young and loved the challenge. During my
00:01:11.119 visit, one of the Lufansza executives
00:01:13.600 asked if I would like to give it a try
00:01:16.240 again and fly this 747 simulator one
00:01:18.960 more time. Before
00:01:22.159 I had time to fully process the
00:01:24.560 question, I heard a voice sounding
00:01:26.799 astonishingly like my own
00:01:30.479 saying, "Yes, I would like that very
00:01:33.200 much."
00:01:35.680 As soon as I said the words, a tsunami
00:01:39.360 of thoughts flooded my mind. I had been
00:01:41.920 a long time since I flew a 747. Back
00:01:44.799 then, I was young and confident captain.
00:01:48.240 Now I had a reputation
00:01:50.799 to live up to as a former chief pilot.
00:01:54.560 Would I embarrass myself in front of
00:01:57.759 these professionals? But it was too late
00:02:00.560 to back down. So, I settled into the
00:02:03.520 captain's seat, placed my hands on the
00:02:05.600 familiar and beloved controls, and felt
00:02:08.479 once again the acceleration of flight as
00:02:12.640 a big jet roared down the runway and
00:02:15.680 took off into the wild blue yonder, even
00:02:19.840 it was only simulated.
00:02:24.000 I'm happy to say that the flight was
00:02:26.480 successful. The aircraft remained
00:02:28.239 intact, and so did my self-image.
00:02:33.680 Even so, the experience was humbling for
00:02:37.840 me. When I was in my prime, flying had
00:02:42.239 become almost second nature. Now, it
00:02:44.560 took all my concentration to do the
00:02:47.599 basic things.
00:02:49.920 My experience in the flight simulator
00:02:52.080 was an important reminder that getting
00:02:55.519 good at anything, whether it be flying,
00:02:58.800 rowing, sewing, or knowing, takes
00:03:02.319 consistent self-disipline
00:03:05.440 and practice.
00:03:07.680 You might spend years acquiring a skill
00:03:10.720 or developing a talent. You might work
00:03:12.800 so hard that it becomes second nature to
00:03:14.879 you. But if you think that means you can
00:03:18.879 stop practicing and studying, you
00:03:21.440 gradually lose the knowledge and
00:03:23.360 abilities you once acquired at great
00:03:25.840 cost. This applies to skills like
00:03:28.640 learning a language, playing a musical
00:03:30.879 instrument, and flying an airliner. It
00:03:33.519 also applies to becoming a disciple of
00:03:39.040 Christ. Simply put,
00:03:43.360 disciplehip
00:03:45.599 takes selfdiscipline.
00:03:49.120 It is not a casual endeavor and it
00:03:52.480 doesn't happen by accident. Faith in
00:03:54.799 Jesus Christ is a gift. But receiving it
00:04:00.080 is a conscience conscious choice that
00:04:04.239 requires a commitment of all our might,
00:04:07.280 mind and strength. It is a practice of
00:04:11.280 every day, every hour. It takes constant
00:04:15.040 learning and determined commitment. Our
00:04:17.918 faith,
00:04:20.238 which is our loyalty to the Savior,
00:04:24.080 becomes stronger as it is tested against
00:04:27.680 the opposition we face here in
00:04:29.680 mortality. It endures because we keep
00:04:33.600 nourishing it. We keep actively applying
00:04:38.000 our faith
00:04:40.479 and we never give up. On the other hand,
00:04:44.639 if we fail to use faith
00:04:48.240 and its convincing power by acting upon
00:04:52.479 it, we become less sure of things we
00:04:57.120 once held sacred, less confident of
00:04:59.919 things we once knew were true.
00:05:02.960 Temptations that would never have
00:05:05.440 enticed us
00:05:07.840 begin to look less appalling
00:05:11.520 and more appealing.
00:05:14.880 The fire of yesterday's testimony can
00:05:17.520 warm us for only so long. It needs
00:05:22.000 constant nourishment to keep burning
00:05:24.880 brightly. In the New Testament, the
00:05:27.520 Savior taught a parable about a master
00:05:31.520 who gave each of his servants a sacred
00:05:34.240 trust, a quantity of money called
00:05:37.199 talents.
00:05:38.800 The servants who diligently used their
00:05:41.680 talents increased them.
00:05:44.240 The servant who buried his talent
00:05:46.720 eventually
00:05:48.400 lost it.
00:05:50.160 The lesson,
00:05:52.000 God gives us gifts of knowledge, of
00:05:54.880 ability, of opportunity,
00:05:58.320 and he wants us to use and amplify them
00:06:02.880 so they can bless us and bless
00:06:06.639 God's other children.
00:06:09.600 That doesn't happen if we put those
00:06:11.680 gifts high on a shelf like a trophy that
00:06:14.800 we admire from time to time. Our gifts
00:06:18.080 magnify and multiply only
00:06:21.280 when we put them to use, activate them.
00:06:25.440 But Elto, you might say, "I don't have
00:06:27.919 any gifts or talents. At least none are
00:06:31.440 that valuable."
00:06:33.919 Well, perhaps you look at others whose
00:06:37.919 gifts are obvious and impressive, and
00:06:40.319 you feel pretty ordinary by comparison.
00:06:43.440 You might suppose that in the premortal
00:06:45.759 existence on the day of the great gift
00:06:47.840 and talent smorggas board your plate
00:06:51.600 seemed awfully sparse
00:06:54.720 especially compared to the stacked and
00:06:57.039 overflowing plates of others.
00:07:00.880 Oh, how I wish
00:07:04.479 I could embrace you
00:07:08.639 and help you
00:07:11.039 understand this great truth.
00:07:14.639 You are a blessed being of light,
00:07:19.599 the spirit child of an infinite God. And
00:07:23.360 you bear within you a potential beyond
00:07:27.840 beyond your own capacity to imagine.
00:07:32.160 As poets have noted, you come to earth
00:07:35.360 trailing clouds of glory.
00:07:39.039 Your origin story is divine
00:07:44.080 and so is your destiny.
00:07:47.919 You left heaven to come here.
00:07:51.599 But heaven has never left you.
00:07:56.639 You are anything but ordinary. You are
00:07:58.960 gifted. In the Doctrine of Covenants,
00:08:00.879 God declared, "There are many gifts, and
00:08:03.599 to every person is given a gift by the
00:08:05.680 spirit of God. To some is given one, and
00:08:08.479 to some is given another, and all may be
00:08:11.280 profited thereby." Some of our gifts are
00:08:14.479 listed in scriptures.
00:08:16.800 Many aren't not.
00:08:20.479 As a prophet Morona said,
00:08:23.680 "Deny not the gifts of God, for there
00:08:26.560 are many, and they come from the same
00:08:28.879 God.
00:08:31.120 They might manifest themselves in
00:08:33.200 different ways, but it is the same God
00:08:36.080 who workketh all in all.
00:08:40.399 It may be true that our spiritual gifts
00:08:42.479 are not always flashy,
00:08:45.519 but that doesn't mean they are less
00:08:48.080 important.
00:08:50.160 May I share with you some spiritual
00:08:52.800 gifts that I have noticed in so many
00:08:55.440 members across the world.
00:08:58.720 Contemplate whether you have been
00:09:01.200 blessed with one or more gifts like
00:09:05.839 showing compassion.
00:09:09.600 Noticing people who are overlooked,
00:09:15.519 finding reasons
00:09:17.519 to be joyful.
00:09:21.040 Being a peacemaker,
00:09:24.640 noticing small miracles,
00:09:29.839 giving sincere compliments,
00:09:34.640 forgiving,
00:09:37.760 repenting,
00:09:40.320 enduring,
00:09:42.880 explaining things simply,
00:09:46.000 connecting with children.
00:09:49.120 sustaining church leaders,
00:09:53.200 helping others know that they belong.
00:09:57.279 You might not see these gifts displayed
00:09:59.200 at the war talent show, but I hope you
00:10:01.680 can see how precious they are to the
00:10:04.959 Lord's work and how you might have
00:10:07.680 touched,
00:10:09.360 blessed, or even saved one of God's
00:10:13.360 children by your gifts. Remember,
00:10:17.839 by small and simple things are great
00:10:20.640 things brought to pass. So, let us each
00:10:25.120 do our little part.
00:10:30.079 My beloved brothers and sisters, dear
00:10:32.079 friends, I pray that the spirit will
00:10:34.160 help you recognize
00:10:36.880 the gifts and talents God has given you.
00:10:40.480 Then let us like the faithful servants
00:10:43.120 in the Lord's parable increase and
00:10:45.200 magnify them. The day will come when we
00:10:48.800 stand before our compassionate father in
00:10:51.360 heaven to give an account of our
00:10:55.279 stewardship.
00:10:57.279 He will want to know what we did with
00:10:59.279 the gifts he gave us in particular how
00:11:01.680 we use them to bless his children. God
00:11:04.560 knows who we truly are, who we are
00:11:07.519 designed to become. And so his
00:11:11.360 expectations for us are high.
00:11:16.079 But he doesn't expect us to take some
00:11:19.120 grand heroic or superhuman leap to get
00:11:23.360 there in the world he created.
00:11:28.160 Growth happens gradually and patiently
00:11:32.959 but also consistently and unrelentingly.
00:11:37.519 Remember it is Jesus Christ.
00:11:41.440 Remember it is Jesus Christ who already
00:11:46.160 did the superhuman part
00:11:49.920 when he conquered death and sin.
00:11:54.320 Our part is to follow
00:11:58.480 the Christ.
00:12:00.800 It is our part to turn away from sin,
00:12:03.839 turn toward the Savior, and walk in his
00:12:07.519 way one step at a time. As we do this
00:12:12.000 diligently and faithfully
00:12:15.040 with the desires of our hearts,
00:12:18.399 we eventually cast off the shackles of
00:12:21.279 imperfections and faults and slowly
00:12:23.600 become refined
00:12:26.000 until that perfect day when we will be
00:12:29.360 perfected in Christ.
00:12:32.560 The blessings are within reach. The
00:12:34.639 promises are in place. The doors wide
00:12:36.720 open. It is our choice to enter and
00:12:41.040 begin. The beginning may be small but
00:12:44.560 that is okay.
00:12:47.600 Where faith is weak begin with a hope in
00:12:51.040 Christ Jesus
00:12:53.120 and in his power to cleanse and purify
00:12:56.480 and reconcile
00:12:59.279 and with a desire
00:13:01.680 to follow him. Our father asks that we
00:13:05.519 approach this challenge of faith and
00:13:07.440 disciplehip not as a casual tourists
00:13:12.079 but as a wholehearted believers
00:13:15.600 who leave behind and abandon Babylon and
00:13:18.160 set their hearts, minds and steps toward
00:13:20.880 Zion.
00:13:23.120 We know that our efforts alone cannot
00:13:27.279 make us celestial,
00:13:29.360 but
00:13:31.120 they can make us loyal and committed to
00:13:34.000 Jesus Christ. and he
00:13:37.600 can make us celear.
00:13:46.639 If we place our hope and faith in him,
00:13:49.519 our victory is assured.
00:13:52.160 He promises us access to his strength,
00:13:55.279 his power, his abundant grace. Step by
00:13:59.040 step, little by little, we will grow
00:14:02.639 ever closer to that great and perfect
00:14:05.120 day when we will live with him and our
00:14:08.800 loved ones in eternal glory.
00:14:11.920 To get there,
00:14:13.920 we must do our part today
00:14:17.680 and every day.
00:14:20.160 We're thankful for the steps we took
00:14:23.040 yesterday. But we don't stop there. We
00:14:26.160 know we still have a long way to go, but
00:14:28.720 we don't let that discourage us. That is
00:14:32.720 the essence of who we are as followers
00:14:37.040 of Christ.
00:14:39.440 I urge and bless every member of the
00:14:41.600 church and all who desire to be part of
00:14:43.920 it
00:14:45.519 to trust the Savior and engage patiently
00:14:48.880 and diligently in doing your part with
00:14:52.160 all your heart
00:14:54.160 that your joy may be full and that one
00:14:56.639 day you will receive all the Father has.
00:15:02.399 Of this I bear witness in the name of
00:15:05.600 Jesus Christ. Amen.
