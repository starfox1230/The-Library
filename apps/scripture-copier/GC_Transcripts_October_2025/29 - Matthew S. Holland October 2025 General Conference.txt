00:00:00.880 A school teacher once taught that a
00:00:03.200 whale, even though large, could not
00:00:05.920 swallow a human because whales have
00:00:08.720 small throats. A girl objected, "But
00:00:12.160 Jonah was swallowed by a whale." The
00:00:14.880 teacher responded, "That's impossible."
00:00:17.760 Still not convinced, the girl said,
00:00:19.359 "Well, when I go to heaven, I will ask
00:00:21.760 him."
00:00:23.680 The teacher sneered, "What if Jonah was
00:00:25.600 a sinner and didn't go to heaven?" The
00:00:28.240 girl replied, "Then you can ask him."
00:00:38.879 We laugh, but we should not miss the
00:00:41.680 power Jonah's story offers every humble
00:00:45.280 seeker of happiness, especially those
00:00:47.760 struggling.
00:00:49.440 God commanded Jonah to go to Nineveh to
00:00:52.239 declare repentance. But Nineveh was
00:00:55.039 ancient Israel's brutal enemy. So Jonah
00:00:58.239 promptly heads the exact opposite
00:01:00.320 direction by boat to Tarses. As he sails
00:01:04.479 away from his calling, a shipwrecking
00:01:06.880 storm develops. Certain his disobedience
00:01:10.240 is the cause, Jonah volunteers to be
00:01:13.040 thrown overboard.
00:01:15.280 This calms the raging sea, which saves
00:01:17.600 his shipmates. Miraculously, Jonah
00:01:20.880 escapes death when a great fish the Lord
00:01:23.680 prepared swallows him. But he languishes
00:01:26.640 in that unbelievably dark and putrid
00:01:29.200 place for three days until he's finally
00:01:31.920 spit out on dry ground. He then accepts
00:01:35.600 his call to Nineveh. Yet, when the city
00:01:38.400 repents and is spared destruction, Jonah
00:01:41.439 resents the mercy shown his enemies. God
00:01:44.560 patiently teaches Jonah that he loves
00:01:47.200 and seeks to rescue all his children.
00:01:51.600 Stumbling more than once in his duties,
00:01:54.399 Jonah provides a vivid testimony that
00:01:57.439 moral that in mortality
00:02:00.000 all are fallen.
00:02:02.560 We don't often speak of a testimony of
00:02:05.439 the fall. But having a doctrinal
00:02:08.639 understanding and spiritual witness of
00:02:11.280 why every single one of us struggle with
00:02:15.280 moral, physical, and situational
00:02:18.319 challenges is a great blessing. Here on
00:02:21.840 earth, ugly weeds grow, even strong
00:02:25.120 bones break, and all come short of the
00:02:28.879 glory of God.
00:02:31.360 But this mortal condition, a result of
00:02:33.920 choices made by Adam and Eve, is
00:02:36.720 essential to the very reason that we
00:02:38.560 exist, that we might have joy. As our
00:02:42.080 first parents learned, only by tasting
00:02:44.239 the bitterness and feeling the pain of a
00:02:46.400 fallen world, could we even conceive of,
00:02:48.640 let alone enjoy true happiness.
00:02:52.319 A testimony of the fall does not excuse
00:02:55.599 sin or a lack approach in life's duties
00:02:59.120 which always call for diligence, virtue,
00:03:02.560 and accountability.
00:03:05.040 But it should temper our frustrations
00:03:07.920 when things just go wrong or we see a
00:03:11.120 moral failing in a family member,
00:03:13.519 friend, or leader.
00:03:16.000 Rather than wallow in contentious
00:03:18.000 criticism or resentment that robs our
00:03:21.120 faith, a testimony of the fall should
00:03:23.440 help us be more like God as described by
00:03:26.720 Jonah. That is merciful, slow to anger,
00:03:31.280 and of great kindness to all, including
00:03:34.480 ourselves in our unavoidably imperfect
00:03:37.440 state.
00:03:40.799 Even greater than manifesting the
00:03:42.720 effects of the fall, Jonah's story
00:03:44.799 powerfully directs us to him who can
00:03:47.360 deliver us from these effects. Jonah's
00:03:50.159 self-sacrifice to save his shipmates is
00:03:53.040 Christlike indeed. And three times when
00:03:56.560 Jesus is pressed for a miraculous sign
00:03:59.280 of his divinity, he thunders that there
00:04:01.920 shall no sign be given but the sign of
00:04:04.319 Jonah,
00:04:05.840 declaring that as Jonah was three days
00:04:07.920 and three nights in the whale's belly,
00:04:10.319 so shall the Son of Man be three days
00:04:12.879 and three nights in the heart of the
00:04:14.640 earth.
00:04:16.320 as a symbol of the Savior's sacrificial
00:04:19.279 death and glorious resurrection.
00:04:23.120 Jonah may be flawed, but this is also
00:04:27.040 what makes his personal witness and
00:04:29.919 commitment to Jesus Christ offered in
00:04:33.280 the belly of the whale so poignant and
00:04:36.320 inspiring. Jonah's cry is that of a good
00:04:39.759 man in crisis, one largely of his own
00:04:43.040 making. For a saint, when catastrophe is
00:04:46.400 brought on by a regrettable habit,
00:04:49.199 comment, or decision, despite so many
00:04:51.840 other good intentions and earnest
00:04:54.080 efforts of righteousness, it can be
00:04:56.320 especially crushing and leave one
00:04:59.040 feeling forsaken.
00:05:01.199 But whatever the cause or degree of
00:05:03.840 disaster we face, there is always dry
00:05:07.520 ground for hope, healing, and happiness.
00:05:12.400 Listen to Jonah.
00:05:15.520 I cried by reason of mine affliction
00:05:18.560 unto the Lord. Out of the belly of hell
00:05:21.840 cried I, for thou hast cast me into the
00:05:25.120 deep, in the midst of the seas, and I
00:05:28.479 said, I'm cast out of thy sight. Yet I
00:05:33.440 will look again toward thy holy temple.
00:05:37.120 The waters compassed me about, even to
00:05:40.080 the soul. The depth closed me round
00:05:42.880 about. The weeds were wrapped about my
00:05:45.120 head. I went down to the bottoms of the
00:05:47.440 mountains. Yet hast thou brought up my
00:05:51.280 life from corruption.
00:05:54.080 When my soul fainted, I remembered the
00:05:57.120 Lord, and my prayer came into thine holy
00:06:00.400 temple.
00:06:02.479 They that observe lying vanities
00:06:06.080 forsake their own mercy.
00:06:11.360 But I will sacrifice unto thee with the
00:06:14.240 voice of thanksgiving. I will pay that
00:06:17.440 that I have vowed.
00:06:19.759 Salvation is of the Lord.
00:06:26.160 Though it was many years ago, I can tell
00:06:29.360 you exactly where I was sitting and
00:06:32.720 exactly what I was thinking and feeling
00:06:36.160 when deep in the belly of a personal
00:06:38.560 hell, I discovered this scripture.
00:06:42.720 For anyone today feeling like I did
00:06:45.039 then, that you are cast off, sinking in
00:06:49.440 the deepest waters with seaweed wrapped
00:06:52.479 about your head and oceanic mountains
00:06:55.120 crashing all around you. My plea,
00:06:58.240 inspired by Jonah, is forsake not your
00:07:02.160 own mercy.
00:07:04.639 You have immediate access to divine help
00:07:08.160 and healing despite your human flaws.
00:07:12.319 This awe inspiring mercy comes in and
00:07:15.360 through Jesus Christ
00:07:18.240 because he knows and loves you
00:07:20.319 perfectly. He offers it to you as your
00:07:23.280 own. Meaning it's perfectly suited to
00:07:26.240 you, designed to relieve your individual
00:07:29.599 agonies and heal your particular pains.
00:07:34.800 So for heaven's sake and yours, do not
00:07:38.400 turn your back on that.
00:07:41.199 Accept it.
00:07:43.199 Start by refusing to listen to the lying
00:07:46.160 vanities of the adversary who would
00:07:48.639 tempt you into thinking that relief is
00:07:51.199 found in sailing away from your
00:07:53.759 spiritual responsibilities.
00:07:56.479 Instead, follow the lead of the
00:07:59.280 repentant Jonah.
00:08:01.840 Cry unto God.
00:08:04.080 Turn to the temple.
00:08:06.400 Cling to your covenants.
00:08:08.639 Serve the Lord, his church, and others
00:08:12.479 with sacrifice and thanksgiving.
00:08:16.400 Doing these things brings a vision of
00:08:19.120 God's special covenantal love for you,
00:08:23.680 what the Hebrew Bible calls.
00:08:27.680 You will see and feel the power of God's
00:08:31.120 loyal, untiring, inexhaustible, and
00:08:35.519 tender mercies that can make you mighty
00:08:38.240 unto deliverance from any sin or any
00:08:41.839 setback.
00:08:44.000 Early and intense anguish may cloud that
00:08:46.720 vision at first, but as you continue to
00:08:50.160 pay that that you have vowed, such a
00:08:53.680 vision will shine brighter and brighter
00:08:56.240 in your soul.
00:08:58.240 And with that vision, you will not only
00:09:01.040 find hope and healing, but
00:09:04.800 astonishingly,
00:09:06.399 you will find joy even in the midst of
00:09:09.600 your crucible.
00:09:11.680 President Nelson taught us so well.
00:09:16.240 When the focus of our lives is on God's
00:09:19.839 plan of salvation and Jesus Christ and
00:09:23.279 his gospel, we can feel joy regardless
00:09:27.440 of what is happening or not happening in
00:09:30.959 our lives. Joy comes from and because of
00:09:34.560 him.
00:09:36.240 Whether we are facing a deep Jonahike
00:09:40.240 catastrophe
00:09:41.920 or the everyday challenges of our
00:09:44.720 imperfect world, the invitation is the
00:09:48.320 same. Forsake not your own mercy.
00:09:54.080 Look to the sign of Jonah, the living
00:09:57.600 Christ. He who rose from his three-day
00:10:00.800 grave, having conquered all for you.
00:10:05.440 Turn to him. Believe in him. Serve him.
00:10:10.640 Smile.
00:10:12.240 For in him and in him alone is found the
00:10:15.680 full and happy healing from the fall we
00:10:18.880 all so urgently need and humbly seek. I
00:10:22.560 testify this is true in the sacred name
00:10:26.000 of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
