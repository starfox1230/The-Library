00:00:00.960 With love unfeigned,
00:00:03.520 we all echo
00:00:06.000 President Oak's tribute to the passing
00:00:10.000 of President Russell M. Nelson.
00:00:13.599 And with equal love and deep mourning,
00:00:17.119 we all acknowledge the tragedies
00:00:21.920 in Michigan recently and
00:00:25.279 almost daily all around the world.
00:00:29.519 We acknowledge these things with love
00:00:32.558 and affection and trust in the Lord
00:00:36.000 Jesus Christ.
00:00:39.920 The ninth chapter of John
00:00:43.200 records the experience of Jesus and his
00:00:46.800 disciples
00:00:48.399 passing near a beggar blind from birth.
00:00:54.160 This led the disciples to ask Jesus
00:00:57.920 several complex religious questions
00:01:02.160 regarding the origin and transmission of
00:01:05.438 this man's limitation.
00:01:08.640 The master responded by doing something
00:01:12.720 very simple and very surprising.
00:01:17.920 He spit into the dirt
00:01:21.520 and stirred a small mixture of clay.
00:01:26.240 He then applied this to the eyes of the
00:01:29.680 man,
00:01:31.600 instructing him to wash in the pool of
00:01:35.280 Siloam.
00:01:37.680 All this
00:01:39.759 the sight sightless man obediently did
00:01:44.799 and quote
00:01:47.200 came forth seeing.
00:01:51.439 The scripture says
00:01:57.360 how important evidence is
00:02:02.880 opposed
00:02:04.640 to wishes
00:02:06.960 or argument
00:02:09.440 or even malice
00:02:12.080 in opposition to the truth.
00:02:18.000 Well, afraid this miracle would again
00:02:20.080 add to the threat Jesus already posed to
00:02:24.400 his presumed authority,
00:02:27.040 the enemies of the Savior confronted the
00:02:30.319 newly cited man and said in anger,
00:02:35.280 "We know Jesus is a sinner."
00:02:41.120 The man listened for a moment and then
00:02:44.080 said,
00:02:46.000 "Whether he be a sinner,
00:02:49.760 I know not.
00:02:52.080 But one thing I do know,
00:02:55.920 whereas I was blind,
00:02:59.120 now I see."
00:03:02.720 How grateful we are
00:03:05.360 for evidence to sustain our declarations
00:03:09.840 of truth.
00:03:13.040 Jesus gave the first meaning to this
00:03:16.400 exchange
00:03:18.560 telling his disciples that all of this
00:03:21.360 had happened that the works of God
00:03:25.840 should be made manifest.
00:03:28.879 Now remember that twice in this
00:03:32.640 narrative,
00:03:34.640 the Savior's action was referred to as
00:03:39.680 anointing the blind man's eyes,
00:03:44.640 an act to be completed by washing.
00:03:50.799 This description of the works of God
00:03:53.920 being made manifest
00:03:56.799 could possibly suggest
00:03:59.439 the unfolding of an ordinance.
00:04:05.200 Now another truth
00:04:07.920 that is evident here are the instruments
00:04:12.080 the creator of heaven and earth and all
00:04:16.079 that in them are
00:04:18.399 all that he used to provide this miracle
00:04:23.199 was spit
00:04:26.240 and a handful of dirt.
00:04:29.840 These very unlikely ingredients
00:04:34.880 declare that God can bless us by
00:04:39.280 whatever method he chooses.
00:04:44.880 Now like non resisting the river Jordan
00:04:49.919 or the children of Israel refusing to
00:04:52.720 look at the serpent on the staff.
00:04:56.479 How easy it is
00:05:00.000 for us to dismiss
00:05:02.479 the source of our redemption
00:05:06.479 because the ingredients and the
00:05:08.960 instruments
00:05:11.680 seem embarrassingly plain.
00:05:17.039 But we remember from the Book of Mormon
00:05:20.720 that some things
00:05:23.199 are plain
00:05:25.360 and precious.
00:05:28.560 And that prior to Jesus's birth,
00:05:32.240 it would be prophesied
00:05:34.800 that he would have no form nor
00:05:39.280 comeliness.
00:05:41.039 And when we should see him, there is no
00:05:44.320 beauty that we should desire him.
00:05:50.479 How often God has sent his majestic
00:05:55.039 message through a newly called and very
00:05:59.360 anxious Relief Society president
00:06:03.759 or an unlearned boy on a New York farm
00:06:10.479 or a
00:06:12.560 brand new missionary
00:06:17.199 or a baby
00:06:19.440 lying in a manger.
00:06:23.919 So what if the answers to our prayers
00:06:29.039 come in plain or even convoluted ways?
00:06:36.319 Are we willing to persevere
00:06:40.479 to keep trying to live Christ's gospel
00:06:45.280 no matter how much spit and clay it
00:06:48.160 takes?
00:06:51.280 It may not always be clear to us what is
00:06:54.720 being done or why.
00:06:57.759 And from time to time, we will all feel
00:07:02.160 a little like the senior sister who
00:07:06.400 said, "Lord, how about a blessing that
00:07:09.599 isn't in disguise?"
00:07:14.319 Consider the evidence of another truth.
00:07:18.160 This one regarding the Holy Priesthood.
00:07:22.400 In documenting the organization of the
00:07:25.120 Meridian church, Luke's first line
00:07:29.039 reads,
00:07:30.960 "Then he called his 12 disciples
00:07:34.560 together
00:07:36.240 and gave them power and authority.
00:07:43.680 gifts not grounded granted on the basis
00:07:47.280 of impressive credentials
00:07:50.400 nor determined by tradition or
00:07:53.120 birthright.
00:07:55.280 They're not bestowed by a divinity
00:07:58.720 school or a theological seminary.
00:08:03.199 They are conferred only by the laying on
00:08:08.160 of hands,
00:08:10.800 by one who has had authorized hands laid
00:08:15.680 on him
00:08:18.319 in an unbroken sequence back to the
00:08:23.199 source of all divine authority,
00:08:27.280 the Lord Jesus Christ.
00:08:32.399 And in a church that understands the
00:08:35.440 gift of mercy,
00:08:38.320 wouldn't it be another marvelous
00:08:41.200 evidence
00:08:42.880 of that church's truthfulness
00:08:47.600 to see these blessings and covenants
00:08:52.240 go to our deceased kindred?
00:08:56.480 Those of our families who've gone before
00:08:59.519 us, should they be penalized
00:09:04.160 because they did not have access to the
00:09:07.200 gospel or the laying on of hands or
00:09:11.120 because they were born at a time or in a
00:09:14.640 place when divine ordinances and
00:09:17.600 covenants were not available to them.
00:09:22.080 The church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
00:09:26.000 Saints
00:09:27.600 has sacred
00:09:29.519 dedicated houses of the Lord
00:09:33.920 in which merciful, salvific work is
00:09:38.240 being done vicariously
00:09:41.920 every day and night
00:09:44.399 for these deceased,
00:09:47.600 as well as offering worship
00:09:49.839 opportunities
00:09:51.440 and ordinances for the living.
00:09:55.920 To my knowledge,
00:09:58.640 this particular evidence of God's truth,
00:10:03.279 his universal love for the living and
00:10:07.440 the dead,
00:10:09.519 is not seen elsewhere in the world
00:10:14.640 except in one church that demonstrates
00:10:20.000 truth in this particular regard, the
00:10:23.600 church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
00:10:26.480 Saints.
00:10:29.519 Now, my first
00:10:32.480 sight giving, lifegiving
00:10:35.760 encounter
00:10:37.600 with real evidence of truth
00:10:42.560 did not come with anointing clay
00:10:47.120 or in the pool of Siloam.
00:10:50.880 No, the instruments of truth that
00:10:54.160 brought my healing
00:10:57.360 from the Lord
00:11:00.079 came as pages in a book.
00:11:05.120 Yes, the Book of Mormon, another
00:11:07.519 testament of Jesus Christ.
00:11:12.079 I love books and I've read books
00:11:17.200 and the claims about this book have been
00:11:20.880 attacked and dismissed by some
00:11:24.160 unbelievers.
00:11:25.839 The anger
00:11:28.320 often matching the vitrial of those who
00:11:32.880 told the healed man that he could not
00:11:35.920 possibly
00:11:37.600 have experienced
00:11:39.680 what he knew. He had experience.
00:11:44.399 I was blind
00:11:46.880 and now I see.
00:11:50.800 That
00:11:52.399 earlier criticism has been hurled at me
00:11:57.279 that the means by which this book came
00:12:00.800 were impractical,
00:12:03.120 unbelievable,
00:12:05.279 embarrassing,
00:12:07.519 even unholy.
00:12:10.800 Now, that's harsh language
00:12:14.639 from anyone
00:12:17.040 who presumes to know the means
00:12:21.440 by which I know
00:12:24.240 and by which the book came to be. In as
00:12:28.160 much as the only description given about
00:12:31.680 those means
00:12:33.680 is that it was translated
00:12:36.639 quote by the gift and power of God close
00:12:40.480 quote. That's it. That's all.
00:12:44.880 In any case, the impact
00:12:48.320 in my life of the Book of Mormon is no
00:12:53.040 less miraculous
00:12:55.120 than was the application of spit and
00:12:59.120 dirt placed on a blind man's eyes.
00:13:05.360 It's been for me
00:13:07.839 a rod of safety for my soul,
00:13:11.680 a transcendent
00:13:13.680 and penetrating
00:13:15.760 light of revelation,
00:13:18.000 an illumination
00:13:20.240 of the path I must walk
00:13:24.480 when mists of darkness come. And surely
00:13:29.200 they have.
00:13:32.560 And surely
00:13:34.880 they will.
00:13:38.240 And given the view it's granted
00:13:41.440 me of my Savior's universal love
00:13:46.480 and his redeeming grace.
00:13:50.320 I share with you my witness.
00:13:54.880 justified here as the newly blessed
00:13:58.480 man's parents said of their son
00:14:03.279 that he should be heard because he was
00:14:05.920 of age.
00:14:08.000 Well, so am I.
00:14:12.160 He was old enough to be taken seriously.
00:14:15.360 They said, "Well, so am I.
00:14:19.920 I am two months away from my 85th
00:14:23.680 birthday.
00:14:25.600 I have been on the edge of death and
00:14:30.160 back.
00:14:32.320 I've walked with kings and prophets,
00:14:36.399 with presidents and prophets and
00:14:39.440 apostles.
00:14:42.000 Best of all,
00:14:44.480 uh, at times I have been
00:14:48.399 overwhelmed
00:14:50.320 by the Holy Spirit of God.
00:14:53.839 I trust that my witness should be given
00:14:58.720 at least some consideration here.
00:15:04.000 Now brothers and sisters,
00:15:07.199 I came to my whole sold conviction
00:15:14.800 that the church of Jesus Christ of
00:15:18.320 Latter-day Saints
00:15:20.959 is a true restoration
00:15:23.920 of the New Testament church and more
00:15:28.800 because I could not deny the evidence.
00:15:35.839 of that restoration.
00:15:39.440 Since those first experiences,
00:15:42.720 I suppose I've had a thousand 10,000
00:15:47.760 other witnesses
00:15:50.959 of evidence that I have spoken today.
00:15:54.880 All of it has been true.
00:15:59.759 I'm delighted now
00:16:02.560 to join my friend
00:16:06.560 huddled
00:16:08.079 on the streets of Jerusalem
00:16:13.360 where with my
00:16:17.120 diminished voice and for that I
00:16:20.480 apologize.
00:16:22.160 Nevertheless,
00:16:24.240 I sing.
00:16:27.120 Amazing
00:16:28.880 grace,
00:16:31.199 how sweet
00:16:33.279 the sound
00:16:35.759 that saved
00:16:38.399 a wretch
00:16:40.320 like me.
00:16:44.160 I once
00:16:46.320 was lost
00:16:48.720 but now
00:16:50.880 am found.
00:16:55.120 Was blind
00:16:57.440 but now
00:16:59.519 I see
00:17:03.120 in the name of Jesus Christ.
00:17:08.240 Amen.
