00:00:01.120 Christ is the good shepherd. Each one of
00:00:04.240 the flock is precious to him. He
00:00:07.279 patterned shephering and taught us by
00:00:09.440 word and deed the qualities of a good
00:00:11.360 shepherd, including knowing your sheep
00:00:14.080 by name, loving them, finding those that
00:00:17.440 are lost, feeding, and ultimately
00:00:20.000 leading them back home again. He expects
00:00:23.119 us to do the same as his undersheperds.
00:00:27.039 We can learn much about ministering the
00:00:28.960 Lord's way from the ancient prophet and
00:00:31.359 exceptional shepherd Moroni.
00:00:34.239 He lived during very difficult times,
00:00:36.800 not having the advantages of cell
00:00:38.879 phones, computers, or the internet. But
00:00:41.760 he managed to keep track of the sheep.
00:00:44.559 How was this done? We get a glimpse into
00:00:47.600 his methodology in Moroni 6.
00:00:51.120 There we read that members were numbered
00:00:54.000 among the people of the church of Christ
00:00:56.079 and their names were taken that they
00:00:59.520 might be remembered and nourished by the
00:01:02.559 good word of God to keep them in the
00:01:04.400 right way. The church did meet together
00:01:07.439 off to fast and to pray and to speak one
00:01:11.439 with another concerning the welfare of
00:01:14.400 their souls.
00:01:16.159 For Moroni, it was all about people,
00:01:20.400 names.
00:01:22.000 He practiced the principle of counting
00:01:24.479 and accounting so that all would be
00:01:27.040 remembered. Any who struggled or
00:01:29.759 wandered were noticed, allowing the
00:01:32.320 saints to discuss their welfare in
00:01:34.400 councils.
00:01:35.920 Like the shepherd who left the 90 and
00:01:37.759 nine safe and secure I am certain and
00:01:40.799 went after the one that was lost. We
00:01:43.600 have been asked to be just as aware of
00:01:45.439 our flocks to notice and remember and go
00:01:48.960 and do likewise.
00:01:51.119 As a mission leader in India, I recall
00:01:54.000 asking a young branch president about
00:01:55.920 some of his goals for the coming year.
00:01:58.799 How many men will you prepare to receive
00:02:00.960 the Melzdc priesthood? His immediate
00:02:03.920 response was seven. Now I wondered from
00:02:07.680 where in the ether he had conjured up
00:02:09.598 that very specific number. Before I
00:02:12.720 could respond, he produced a piece of
00:02:15.040 paper with numbers from 1 through 7
00:02:18.000 written down the side. The first five
00:02:20.879 lines had names on them. Real people
00:02:24.400 that he and his elders quorum were going
00:02:26.400 to invite and encourage to have the
00:02:28.879 blessings of the priesthood in their
00:02:30.480 lives. Of course, I had to ask about the
00:02:34.239 empty lines six and seven. "Oh,
00:02:37.680 president," he said, shaking his head
00:02:40.080 sympathetically. "Surely we will baptize
00:02:43.599 at least two men in the first of the
00:02:46.319 year who could have the priesthood by
00:02:48.800 the end of the year."
00:02:51.200 This superb leader understood the
00:02:54.080 principle of counting and accounting.
00:02:58.879 Christ has organized his church in such
00:03:01.200 a way that it should be difficult to
00:03:04.239 forget a soul for each is dear to him.
00:03:09.519 Every individual in a ward regardless of
00:03:12.319 age or gender has a multitude of
00:03:14.959 stewards, shepherds who are tasked with
00:03:18.159 looking after them with remembering.
00:03:22.080 A young man, for example, has assigned
00:03:24.480 to his well-being a bishop brick,
00:03:26.959 ministering brothers, adult youth
00:03:29.040 adviserss, seminary teachers, quorum
00:03:31.840 presidencies, and then some. All serving
00:03:35.040 as safety nets strung up firmly beneath
00:03:38.480 that youth to catch him if he falls.
00:03:41.920 Even if just one net is properly
00:03:44.319 positioned, that young man will be safe,
00:03:47.200 noticed, and remembered. And yet often
00:03:51.120 we find ner a net in place. People
00:03:55.280 wander off routinely into the mists and
00:03:58.239 no one notices.
00:04:00.560 How can we be better shepherds?
00:04:03.280 We can learn to count and account. The
00:04:06.720 church supplies us with reports and
00:04:08.720 tools to do just that, to remember. The
00:04:12.080 quarterly report is a prime example. It
00:04:15.200 allows us to count and account for each
00:04:17.759 member multiple times and to notice
00:04:20.959 those that go missing or need our help
00:04:23.280 and our love. The action and interview
00:04:26.080 list identifies those who require our
00:04:28.320 attention right now as does the temple
00:04:31.600 recommend status report and others.
00:04:34.160 These counting and accounting tools
00:04:36.400 focus us in on people.
00:04:39.440 Who needs a calling, a priesthood
00:04:41.840 advancement, or help taking a family
00:04:44.240 name to the temple? Who could we be
00:04:46.720 helping to prepare for a full-time
00:04:48.479 mission?
00:04:50.320 Who went missing this month? These tools
00:04:53.600 help us to remember people.
00:04:56.639 I knew a family that took an assignment
00:04:58.479 in Africa. On their very first Sunday,
00:05:01.040 they walked into the only church unit in
00:05:03.120 the country where they were greeted
00:05:04.880 enthusiastically.
00:05:06.639 By the end of the morning, the man's
00:05:08.560 wife had been called as the Relief
00:05:10.240 Society president and he as the young
00:05:12.800 men's leader.
00:05:14.880 He asked an exhausted looking branch
00:05:17.039 president how many young men there were.
00:05:20.639 This faithful first generation leader
00:05:22.720 pointed to the back of the sacrament
00:05:24.320 hall and said, "Those two right there."
00:05:27.759 The man was appropriately skeptical, so
00:05:30.560 he took a branch roster home, quickly
00:05:32.800 noting that there were actually 20 young
00:05:35.440 men on the list. He returned to the
00:05:38.160 branch president and asked for two
00:05:40.400 dynamic, bilingual young adults to serve
00:05:43.039 as his counselors and then sat down with
00:05:45.600 them and the two boys to review the
00:05:48.320 names.
00:05:50.000 Then these diligent young people went to
00:05:53.199 work.
00:05:54.880 Over the next few months, they found
00:05:57.199 every boy listed. Name by name, those
00:06:00.960 lost sheep were welcomed back by their
00:06:02.960 peers and fed spiritually and
00:06:05.759 physically. Within a year, on any given
00:06:08.880 Sunday, there was an average of 21 young
00:06:11.680 men in attendance. Thank goodness for
00:06:14.800 young men who counted and accounted.
00:06:17.919 A dear friend of mine as a young
00:06:19.680 graduate student moved with his family
00:06:21.520 to a large American city to continue his
00:06:24.160 education. He was immediately called to
00:06:26.560 preside over the elders quorum. A little
00:06:29.680 nervous about his first interview with
00:06:31.440 the state president, he was determined
00:06:33.680 to go prepared. He told the state
00:06:36.720 president that he had three goals for
00:06:38.880 the upcoming year. First, 90%
00:06:41.840 ministering. Second, a substantive
00:06:44.720 gospel lesson each week. And third, a
00:06:47.919 well-planned quorum activity every
00:06:50.160 month.
00:06:51.680 Smiling at my friend, this wise state
00:06:54.479 president asked, "Can you name a less
00:06:57.600 active quorum member who you could help
00:07:00.080 get to the temple with his family this
00:07:01.919 year?" "Well, that caught my friend by
00:07:04.479 surprise. He thought carefully and came
00:07:07.199 up with a name." "Write that down,"
00:07:09.759 directed the state president. Then this
00:07:12.720 experienced leader asked the same
00:07:14.800 question. three more times and the
00:07:17.919 interview was over.
00:07:20.400 This young man walked out of that
00:07:22.160 interview having learned one of his
00:07:24.560 greatest lessons on leadership and
00:07:26.560 ministering. He went into the interview
00:07:29.039 with programs, lessons and activities.
00:07:32.160 He walked out with names
00:07:36.000 and those four names subsequently became
00:07:38.720 a major focus of his ministry and that
00:07:41.360 of his quorum.
00:07:43.599 As a mission leader, I visited one of my
00:07:45.919 branches one Sunday morning. I noticed
00:07:48.400 that the branch president kept taking a
00:07:50.400 card out of his pocket and writing on
00:07:52.560 it. I decided to ask him about that
00:07:55.120 after the closing prayer. Once the
00:07:57.759 meeting ended, and before I could
00:07:59.199 inquire about the card, the branch
00:08:01.440 mission leader raced to the podium where
00:08:03.680 he was handed the paper. I quickly
00:08:06.479 followed this enthusiastic leader to his
00:08:08.720 weekly branch missionary coordination
00:08:11.039 meeting. Before they started, he took
00:08:14.160 the paper out of his pocket. It was
00:08:16.800 filled with the names of members who had
00:08:20.080 been missing from sacrament meeting.
00:08:22.720 Within a few minutes, each member of the
00:08:24.800 council had selected a name or two,
00:08:27.199 committing to visit them that very day
00:08:30.160 to make sure that they were okay and to
00:08:32.559 let them know that they had been missed.
00:08:35.200 Now, that is counting and accounting.
00:08:38.880 I recall a district hours by jet from
00:08:42.080 the nearest temple where maintaining a
00:08:44.320 current recommend was a high priority
00:08:46.880 despite the fact that it would likely
00:08:48.959 never be used. The first Sunday of each
00:08:52.320 month, leaders used their counting tools
00:08:54.800 to account for their endowed members. If
00:08:57.920 they found that a recommend was soon to
00:08:59.839 expire, the executive secretary would
00:09:02.320 schedule an a renewal interview. People
00:09:05.440 with expired recommends were
00:09:07.120 counseledled over, then sought out to
00:09:09.680 assist them in returning to the covenant
00:09:11.519 path. I asked how many of their endowed
00:09:14.640 members had a current recommend. The
00:09:17.040 answer was an astounding 98.6%.
00:09:22.399 When asked about the six whose
00:09:24.880 recommends had expired, the leaders were
00:09:27.680 able to identify them by name and
00:09:30.880 described to me the efforts being made
00:09:33.200 to get them back.
00:09:35.839 A few years ago, my family moved back to
00:09:38.160 the States. We were excited to attend
00:09:40.480 the church here after 26 amazing years
00:09:44.480 in smaller, more isolated units. I was
00:09:47.839 called as a word missionary. We had a
00:09:50.720 great ward mission leader and were doing
00:09:52.800 exciting things and teaching wonderful
00:09:54.640 people. I asked to attend a ward council
00:09:58.080 meeting to observe and to get their help
00:10:00.560 with the friends we were working with. I
00:10:03.519 was surprised when all that we discussed
00:10:05.920 was an upcoming ward activity.
00:10:08.880 I approached the ward mission leader
00:10:10.560 afterwards and opined that he didn't get
00:10:13.120 the chance to return and report on our
00:10:15.200 people. His response, "Oh, I never get
00:10:18.959 to report."
00:10:20.959 I contrasted that
00:10:23.440 to a branch council meeting in Lahore,
00:10:27.120 Pakistan that I had attended just weeks
00:10:30.240 before.
00:10:31.760 This little group sat around a small
00:10:33.920 table together and all they talked about
00:10:37.680 were people, names.
00:10:40.880 Each leader reported on their
00:10:42.720 stewardship and the individuals and
00:10:44.800 families that they were concerned about.
00:10:47.360 All had the chance to add their thoughts
00:10:49.680 on the best ways that they could bless
00:10:52.000 those being discussed. Plans were made
00:10:55.120 and assignments given. What a brilliant
00:10:58.160 lesson in counting and accounting by
00:11:00.959 name from our first generation brothers
00:11:03.920 and sisters.
00:11:05.760 In the church of Jesus Christ, we have
00:11:08.720 been instructed by prophets past and
00:11:11.440 prophets present and by the pattern set
00:11:14.240 by our savior how to minister. We take
00:11:18.000 names, we remember, and we counsel over
00:11:21.920 the welfare of souls. Leaders who do
00:11:25.279 this will never run out of agenda items
00:11:27.920 in their council meetings. The principle
00:11:30.800 of counting and accounting works. It is
00:11:33.600 the Lord's way. We can do better to God
00:11:38.320 who created the universe and rules over
00:11:41.040 all. This work, his work in glory is
00:11:45.040 very personal. And so it should be for
00:11:48.720 each of us as instruments in his hands
00:11:51.519 in his amazing work of salvation and
00:11:53.600 exaltation. Miracles in the lives of
00:11:56.320 real people will result in the name of
00:11:58.720 Jesus Christ. Amen.
