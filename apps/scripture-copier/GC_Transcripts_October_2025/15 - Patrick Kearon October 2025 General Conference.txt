00:00:00.960 Jesus went about doing good.
00:00:05.759 We read that simple report in the book
00:00:08.160 of Acts.
00:00:09.920 What an enormous understatement that is.
00:00:15.599 Jesus surely did go about doing good. He
00:00:18.720 is the very essence and source of
00:00:21.600 goodness. He devoted his entire mortal
00:00:25.199 life to doing good.
00:00:28.240 He is merciful and gracious,
00:00:30.720 long-suffering and abundant, infinite in
00:00:33.600 goodness, and everlasting in mercy.
00:00:37.360 Any attempt at describing or summarizing
00:00:40.239 his goodness and mercy would be an
00:00:43.040 understatement.
00:00:45.200 Truly, as the Apostle John tried to
00:00:48.000 express, if we were to attempt to record
00:00:51.920 every manifestation of the Savior's
00:00:54.000 goodness, even the world itself could
00:00:56.879 not contain the books that should be
00:00:59.039 written.
00:01:01.440 The specific examples we do have
00:01:04.239 immortalized in scripture of Jesus going
00:01:06.640 about doing good stir deep awe and
00:01:09.200 wonder, especially when we really
00:01:11.680 consider what it might have been like to
00:01:14.159 be there, to witness his miracles, to
00:01:18.000 receive his teachings, and to experience
00:01:21.680 his healing.
00:01:23.920 He conversed with the social outcasts.
00:01:26.960 He touched the diseased and unclean. He
00:01:30.159 brought comfort to the weary. He taught
00:01:33.280 liberating truth. And he called sinners
00:01:35.439 to repentance. To each leper, blind man,
00:01:39.360 and adulterous woman. To the lame, the
00:01:42.400 deaf, and the dumb. To every grieving
00:01:45.600 mother, desperate father, and mourning
00:01:48.240 widow. To the condemned, the shamed, and
00:01:51.759 the suffering. To the dead in body, and
00:01:54.479 the dead in spirit. What he did was
00:01:57.520 offer a new beginning.
00:02:01.840 Yes, another staggering understatement.
00:02:06.880 Everything he said and did provided a
00:02:10.160 new beginning for each of those he
00:02:12.560 healed, blessed, taught, and relieved of
00:02:15.520 sin. He didn't withdraw from them, and
00:02:20.000 he certainly won't withdraw from you.
00:02:24.800 Imagine in this moment hearing any of
00:02:27.599 these life-giving words from him. Son,
00:02:32.879 thy sins be forgiven thee. Damsel, I say
00:02:37.360 unto thee, arise,
00:02:40.160 be thou clean. Neither do I condemn
00:02:43.599 thee. Go and sin no more. Daughter, be
00:02:48.400 of good comfort. Thy faith hath made
00:02:50.720 thee whole. Go in peace.
00:02:54.239 The Savior's words to these individuals
00:02:56.800 were brief, but with them he painted
00:03:00.000 vast new horizons of forgiveness,
00:03:03.200 healing, restoration, peace, and eternal
00:03:07.280 life. And the glorious news is he offers
00:03:10.720 the same new beginning to you and to me.
00:03:15.599 All of us can have a new beginning
00:03:18.000 through and because of Jesus Christ,
00:03:20.720 even you. New beginnings are at the
00:03:23.760 heart of the father's plan for his
00:03:25.920 children. This is the church of new
00:03:29.840 beginnings.
00:03:31.360 This is the church of fresh starts.
00:03:35.440 With baptism by water and the spirit, we
00:03:37.840 are born again and can walk in newness
00:03:40.080 newness of life.
00:03:42.560 How much hope does that new beginning
00:03:44.879 bring to one who has trudged under the
00:03:46.959 burden of sin or suffered from the
00:03:49.440 effects of a troubled life and
00:03:51.040 dysfunctional relationships?
00:03:53.760 Jesus needed no forgiveness of sin
00:03:56.400 himself or a fresh start in life. Yet he
00:03:59.280 was baptized, showing us in high relief
00:04:02.720 the way to the new beginning he has
00:04:05.920 carved for each of us.
00:04:09.280 And our new beginning doesn't just
00:04:11.519 happen once. We tend to think that
00:04:14.080 baptism is our one shot at a new
00:04:16.560 beginning. It isn't. We don't have just
00:04:20.320 one chance. These new beginnings can
00:04:23.360 happen every day and certainly every
00:04:27.280 week as we eat a small piece of bread
00:04:29.280 and drink a tiny cup of water in
00:04:31.759 remembrance of the gift of our perfect
00:04:34.160 savior who died for the express purpose
00:04:38.800 of giving us as many new beginnings as
00:04:42.240 we need.
00:04:45.600 Jesus gives us as many new beginnings as
00:04:49.680 we need.
00:04:52.000 With commitment and rejoicing in a new
00:04:54.400 life in Christ, we can become a new
00:04:56.639 creature where old things pass away and
00:04:59.520 all things become new. What reprieve
00:05:03.600 does that kind of new dawn bring to a
00:05:05.919 soul who keeps trying through continuing
00:05:08.240 to choose faith in our redeemer's power
00:05:10.880 to heal and restore despite the crushing
00:05:14.639 setbacks of living in a fallen world.
00:05:18.320 The Savior never gave up on his
00:05:21.199 commitment to fulfill the will of the
00:05:23.120 Father and complete his divine atoning
00:05:26.160 mission, even through the pain that
00:05:28.400 caused him to tremble, to bleed from
00:05:30.720 every pore, to suffer body and spirit,
00:05:33.680 and pray that the bitter cup might be
00:05:36.479 removed.
00:05:38.080 Again, he was demonstrating for us what
00:05:41.120 faithful endurance with God looks like.
00:05:45.280 With every covenant we make and every
00:05:47.280 effort we give to keep it, we can
00:05:50.320 receive a new heart and a fuller measure
00:05:53.199 of a new spirit. Little by little, the
00:05:56.400 more we invite his goodness into our
00:05:58.720 hearts and cast out the selfdefeating
00:06:02.639 voices in our heads, we become his
00:06:05.840 people because we truly make him our
00:06:08.160 God.
00:06:09.520 Jesus so so keenly wants to be our king
00:06:12.720 and our shepherd and our prince of
00:06:15.039 peace. And we can choose to make him so
00:06:19.280 in our own hearts and minds.
00:06:23.840 Repentance opens the door to our new
00:06:26.479 beginnings, fresh starts, and second
00:06:28.560 chances. Our dear President Nelson's
00:06:31.199 teachings have cleared up misconceptions
00:06:33.360 about the divine gift of repentance. And
00:06:36.080 I think we finally begin to grasp it.
00:06:40.560 It's exciting to hear our youth describe
00:06:42.639 what repentance means to them. I
00:06:45.039 recently heard a young woman say with a
00:06:47.280 smile on her face, and I quote, "When I
00:06:50.400 think of repentance, daily repentance, I
00:06:53.360 feel incredible joy and hope. I feel the
00:06:56.560 love and happiness of my heavenly father
00:06:58.479 and my savior. I'm not afraid to come to
00:07:01.599 Heavenly Father in prayer and ask for
00:07:03.680 his help with whatever I'm struggling
00:07:05.840 with. I know they're not trying to catch
00:07:08.639 me doing something wrong. Their arms are
00:07:12.560 open wide.
00:07:14.960 This is repentance to me. She said,
00:07:20.080 "This young woman understands that
00:07:22.000 because of Jesus Christ, she can have
00:07:25.759 new beginnings.
00:07:28.000 Do you need a new beginning?
00:07:30.800 Can you make a fresh start? Even you?
00:07:35.120 Think about the people the Savior
00:07:36.639 minister to ministered to. The people he
00:07:39.199 taught, healed, raised, forgave, and
00:07:41.280 restored. Was he selecting them from a
00:07:44.080 particular economic class or background?
00:07:46.560 Was he distinguishing between the
00:07:48.240 righteous and the sinful? Was he
00:07:50.160 singling people out because they were
00:07:52.319 more deserving or more loved? No.
00:07:56.319 Some came to him with great faith,
00:07:58.319 believing in his power to heal. Like the
00:08:01.199 woman with the issue of blood, the Roman
00:08:03.520 centurion whose servant was dying, the
00:08:06.240 leper, Gyrus, and blind Bartameus, they
00:08:10.639 each put their faith on the line, hoping
00:08:12.800 that the goodness and power of the rabbi
00:08:15.919 from Nazareth would change their lives
00:08:18.160 and their prospects. And he did. He let
00:08:22.000 his healing flow.
00:08:24.479 But Jesus also blessed those who had
00:08:27.360 wavering faith like the father of the
00:08:30.160 sick child who cried out perhaps as you
00:08:32.640 have Lord I believe help thou mine
00:08:36.159 unbelief
00:08:37.679 and he even poured out compassion upon
00:08:39.919 those who hadn't sought him at all like
00:08:42.320 the woman taken in adultery the widow of
00:08:45.040 Naine the disabled man at the pool of
00:08:47.040 Bethesda and the man born blind.
00:08:51.200 Have you felt him going about doing good
00:08:54.480 in your life even when you haven't been
00:08:56.959 seeking him or following him?
00:08:59.519 To each of these scriptural figures and
00:09:01.839 to all who would listen and respond, he
00:09:05.279 gave a new beginning. Whether it was a
00:09:08.880 new life forgiven of sin or a new life
00:09:12.080 healed of diseased or a new life raised
00:09:15.440 from death.
00:09:17.360 What does this mean for you and for me?
00:09:20.399 His goodness and mercy and loving
00:09:23.440 kindness know no bounds.
00:09:26.560 New beginnings are at the heart of the
00:09:29.600 father's plan. Fresh starts are the
00:09:34.080 mission of the son.
00:09:37.279 New dawns, new chapters, and new chances
00:09:41.279 are the simple core of the gospel's good
00:09:44.560 news.
00:09:46.320 So, have you been away too long from
00:09:49.519 your covenants to receive a new
00:09:51.760 beginning? No. Have you done this or
00:09:55.440 that too many times to be given another
00:09:58.560 chance? No. Have you gone too far from
00:10:02.080 Christ for him to help you write a new
00:10:04.240 story from here on out? No.
00:10:08.160 The adversary is the only one who
00:10:10.080 benefits from the idea that you're sunk.
00:10:14.240 You are not.
00:10:17.600 And new beginnings are for more than
00:10:19.600 just our sins and mistakes. Through the
00:10:22.000 goodness and grace of the Savior, we can
00:10:24.399 have fresh starts that propel change in
00:10:27.200 old mindsets, bad habits, grumpy
00:10:30.160 dispositions,
00:10:32.320 negative attitudes, feelings of
00:10:34.800 powerlessness, and tendencies to blame
00:10:37.440 others and avoid personal
00:10:39.360 responsibility.
00:10:41.200 You can actually change things about
00:10:43.920 yourself that have been wearing you down
00:10:46.240 for years. You can start again through
00:10:50.160 the might of the master of new
00:10:53.120 beginnings.
00:10:54.640 He never tires of giving those new
00:10:57.680 beginnings to us.
00:11:00.640 To those who are struggling with the
00:11:02.480 same sin or the same setback over and
00:11:04.800 over again, you keep going. He's put He
00:11:08.959 hasn't put a roadblock in front of you.
00:11:12.079 He hasn't set a limit on your second
00:11:14.160 chances. You press on. You keep
00:11:17.120 striving. You seek help from those
00:11:19.440 around you. And you trust in the new
00:11:22.480 beginning that is there for you every
00:11:24.800 time you turn back to your father in
00:11:27.279 sincerity of heart. Leave deliberate
00:11:30.320 sinning, casual repeats, and prideful
00:11:34.000 rebellion behind you where they belong.
00:11:37.040 You don't have to be who you've been
00:11:39.440 before.
00:11:41.839 Embrace your fresh start, your second or
00:11:45.200 third or fourth or hundth chance offered
00:11:48.800 to you through the atoning blood of
00:11:51.279 Jesus Christ. I am grateful beyond
00:11:54.880 description for the new beginnings I've
00:11:56.800 been given and for those I will yet be
00:12:00.160 offered. Our savior uttered one final
00:12:04.640 understatement without which there would
00:12:07.040 be no cause for hope or rejoicing this
00:12:09.600 day.
00:12:11.920 After the agonies of Gethsemane and at
00:12:14.959 the conclusion of the torturous cross,
00:12:18.560 he simply said, "It is finished."
00:12:25.600 Messianic prophecy had been fulfilled
00:12:27.839 and the full payment of the debt for
00:12:30.160 humanity's sins and suffering had been
00:12:33.279 paid. He declared finished his infinite
00:12:39.120 and eternal sacrifice.
00:12:42.000 Yet his atonement would not be complete
00:12:45.519 until he himself experienced new life on
00:12:49.920 the third day.
00:12:52.000 The new beginning as a glorified
00:12:56.720 resurrected being through the power of
00:12:59.839 the father.
00:13:03.120 Because he always did those things which
00:13:05.440 pleased his father. And because he
00:13:07.200 suffered the will of the father in all
00:13:09.120 things, you and I can have new
00:13:11.200 beginnings.
00:13:13.279 Please receive your new beginning even
00:13:18.079 today,
00:13:20.160 right now.
00:13:22.320 Jesus Christ is the author and finisher
00:13:24.880 of our faith, writing countless new
00:13:27.519 chapters with us. He is the beginning
00:13:29.920 and the end. The end of our shame and
00:13:33.920 suffering and the beginning of a new
00:13:37.040 life in him, letting us receive
00:13:41.680 his grace and leave the past behind and
00:13:46.800 begin again with a new dawn as many
00:13:50.560 times as we need. Truly his goodness and
00:13:54.800 mercy shall follow us all the days of
00:13:59.040 our lives in the name of Jesus Christ.
00:14:03.199 Amen.
