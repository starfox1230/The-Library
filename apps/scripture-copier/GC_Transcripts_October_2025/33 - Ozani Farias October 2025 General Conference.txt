00:00:01.760 Brothers and sisters, can you remember a
00:00:05.279 moment when someone gave you a gift that
00:00:08.639 changed your life?
00:00:11.920 This October marks 40 years since I
00:00:14.719 received one of the greatest gifts in my
00:00:17.119 life. While I was high school, I noticed
00:00:20.880 that one of our classmates had a light
00:00:24.240 that was different from most of the
00:00:26.240 other young people. I enjoy being around
00:00:28.960 him.
00:00:30.160 One day he told me he was a member of
00:00:32.399 the church of Jesus Christ of Latterday
00:00:34.559 Saints. And then he offered a copy of
00:00:37.760 the Book of Mormon. He invite me to read
00:00:41.040 a few pages and meet with two friends
00:00:43.760 who could answer my questions.
00:00:47.039 Those friends were the missionaries.
00:00:50.559 When I met with the missionaries, they
00:00:52.480 taught me the doctrine of Christ. Invite
00:00:54.879 me to follow the prophet's Moroni's
00:00:57.520 invitation.
00:00:59.199 When we shall receive these things, I
00:01:01.440 would exhort to you that we would ask
00:01:03.920 God the eternal father and the name of
00:01:07.360 Christ if these things are not true. And
00:01:10.479 if we ask, if we shall ask with a
00:01:13.280 sincere heart, with real intent, having
00:01:16.560 faith in Christ, he will manifest the
00:01:19.119 true of it unto you by the power of the
00:01:22.159 Holy Ghost. I read several pages of the
00:01:25.520 Book of Mormon and prayed. Although I
00:01:28.400 did not yet have a deep understanding of
00:01:31.280 all the things that the missionaries
00:01:33.040 were teaching me, I felt in my heart
00:01:36.880 that was I was reading and I was it was
00:01:39.759 good and came from God.
00:01:42.560 I received the confirmation of Moronai's
00:01:45.040 promise and by the power of the Holy
00:01:47.840 Ghost we may know the truth of all
00:01:50.479 things.
00:01:52.399 After I was baptized into the Church of
00:01:54.799 Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, some
00:01:57.520 friends trying to convince me that I had
00:01:59.920 made the wrong decision.
00:02:02.479 But each time I face such doubts or
00:02:05.119 opposition,
00:02:06.719 I received renewed confirmation through
00:02:09.840 studying the scriptures and praying to
00:02:12.319 stay true to the covenant I had entered
00:02:15.599 into with God. Since then, the Book of
00:02:19.200 Mormon has been my companion and has
00:02:22.640 become a measurable treasure in my
00:02:25.599 mortal journey.
00:02:27.680 The Book of Mormon is more than just a
00:02:29.599 book. It is another testament of Jesus
00:02:32.160 Christ written by many ances prophets
00:02:35.280 through the spirit of prophecy and
00:02:37.519 revelation.
00:02:39.280 The most significant event recorded in
00:02:41.840 the Book of Mormon is the personal
00:02:44.239 ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among
00:02:47.360 the Nephites shortly after his
00:02:49.680 resurrection.
00:02:51.360 The Book of Mormon puts forth the
00:02:53.360 doctrine of the gospel, outlines the
00:02:56.319 plan of salvation, and tells men what
00:02:59.599 they must do to gain peace in this life
00:03:03.040 and eternal salvation in the life to
00:03:05.680 come.
00:03:07.519 The first edition of the Book of Mormon
00:03:09.840 or the testament of Jesus Christ was
00:03:12.640 published in a small town in the state
00:03:15.040 of New York in March 1830.
00:03:18.000 The prophet Joseph Smith was only three
00:03:20.879 23 years old when he completed the
00:03:23.840 translation of the book in 1829.
00:03:27.599 He translate almost the entire book in
00:03:30.480 less than 75 days and the printing
00:03:33.360 process took about seven months.
00:03:36.799 Today, approximately 80,000 full-time
00:03:39.599 missionaries in more than 150 countries
00:03:43.040 are serving as volunteers
00:03:45.760 dedicating their lives to bearing
00:03:47.840 witness that the Book of M is true and
00:03:51.280 that it testifies of Jesus Christ.
00:03:55.200 At the most recent seminar for new
00:03:57.439 mission leaders in June of this past
00:03:59.920 year, President Russell M. Nelson share
00:04:02.799 his powerful testimony of the Book of
00:04:05.040 Mormon. Quote, "The Book of Mormon is
00:04:08.319 the word of God. It teaches the doctrine
00:04:11.120 of Christ and explain more about the
00:04:13.599 Savior's atonement than any other book."
00:04:16.560 End quote. I would like to offer three
00:04:19.759 suggestions that can help deepen our
00:04:22.240 conversion to Jesus Christ through a
00:04:25.120 study of the Book of Mormon. First, be
00:04:28.479 diligent in consistent in your daily
00:04:30.960 study. Like Alma and the sons of Mosiah,
00:04:34.880 we must search the scriptures diligently
00:04:37.040 that we might know the word of God and
00:04:40.000 be strengthened in the truth.
00:04:43.199 While serve as mission leaders in the
00:04:45.440 Georgia Atlanta mission, we encourage
00:04:48.240 every missionary to study the Book of
00:04:50.479 Mormon for at least 30 minutes daily.
00:04:54.320 That commitment increase our faith and
00:04:56.960 help us to seek and expect miracles.
00:05:01.280 It is possible that after the mission we
00:05:03.520 may not have the same amount of time
00:05:06.000 available for daily scripture study. But
00:05:09.039 I promise that if you sincerely
00:05:12.080 prioritize your studying the Book of
00:05:14.560 Mormon prayerfully each day, you will
00:05:17.840 find great spiritual strength and
00:05:20.560 confidence in the Lord and his promises.
00:05:24.080 The second suggestion is make your study
00:05:26.880 more meaningful by feasting upon the
00:05:29.199 words of Christ.
00:05:31.280 Nephi thought feasting upon the words of
00:05:34.400 Christ for behold the words of Christ
00:05:37.840 will tell you all things what we should
00:05:41.280 do.
00:05:42.800 To feast means more than just reading.
00:05:45.919 It means savoring, pondering, and
00:05:49.600 applying. As you study the Book of
00:05:52.240 Mormon, consider ways to make your study
00:05:55.759 more meaningful. For example, use study
00:05:59.759 aids available in the Gospel Library
00:06:02.160 app. Identify eternal truth that help us
00:06:06.639 understand God's plan and lead us to
00:06:09.680 make and keep confidence with our
00:06:11.600 heavenly father. and highlight
00:06:14.319 significant phrases and record your
00:06:17.360 impressions to preserve what you have
00:06:19.520 learned during your study.
00:06:22.080 The Book of Mormon has the power to
00:06:24.080 answer questions of our souls. As Nephi
00:06:28.080 said, we should liken all scriptures
00:06:31.039 unto us that it might be for our profit
00:06:34.560 and learning. As we feast upon the words
00:06:37.680 of Christ, they will open the door to
00:06:40.720 revelation and show us what we need to
00:06:43.759 do and the very circumstance of our life
00:06:47.039 to draw closer to him. The third
00:06:50.319 suggestion, bear your testimony of the
00:06:53.280 truthness of the Book of Mormon. Just as
00:06:56.639 Lehi desires to share the fruit of the
00:06:59.199 tree of life with his family. When we
00:07:02.479 gain a testimony of the Book of Mormon,
00:07:04.880 we develop a desire to share the joy
00:07:08.080 that comes from knowing the gospel of
00:07:10.319 Jesus Christ.
00:07:12.560 One of our missionaries, Sister Benson,
00:07:15.120 who is attending with us this um
00:07:17.919 session,
00:07:19.759 um share with me her desire to help her
00:07:22.639 young brother. At that time, he was
00:07:26.080 prepared to attend college and wasn't
00:07:28.400 sure about serving mission.
00:07:31.039 I felt impressed to invite Sister Benson
00:07:34.560 to read the Book of Mormon
00:07:37.199 during the first four months of her
00:07:39.039 mission, marking her favorite verses,
00:07:42.720 and then said that copy to her brother.
00:07:46.800 Sister Benson sent that market copy of
00:07:49.280 the Book of Mormon, invite her brother
00:07:52.240 to read from each for each night. She
00:07:56.479 later shared with me, "Before my
00:07:58.800 mission, my brother wasn't sure if he
00:08:01.680 want to serve a full-time mission.
00:08:03.840 Slowly over time, as he read the Book of
00:08:07.199 Mormon, he found increasing joy in his
00:08:09.919 life and began to consider servant
00:08:12.720 mission.
00:08:14.319 Two weeks before
00:08:16.479 Sister Benson completed her mission,
00:08:19.919 her brother received his mission call.
00:08:23.520 He is now serving in the Mexico Chushula
00:08:26.720 Gutier at his mission. Through the Book
00:08:29.599 of Mormon, Elder Benson came to see his
00:08:32.320 life with spiritual clarity which led
00:08:35.599 him to serve the Lord and trust that
00:08:38.000 things would work out. That decision was
00:08:41.200 a miracle influenced by the power of the
00:08:43.599 words of Christ.
00:08:45.680 My beloved brothers and sisters, I
00:08:48.240 encourage each of you to deepen your
00:08:50.959 study of the Book of Mormon. I know as
00:08:54.240 we feast upon the words of Christ found
00:08:56.720 in the Book of Mormon, the Spirit will
00:08:59.600 help us understand eternal truth and
00:09:02.560 share our testimony with conviction to
00:09:05.680 those whom the Lord has prepared to hear
00:09:08.160 his message. The Lord said, "My elect
00:09:12.240 hear my voice and harden not their
00:09:14.880 hearts." I testified that those who ask
00:09:19.279 God in faith will gain a testimony of
00:09:22.080 the truth of and divinity of the book of
00:09:24.720 Momo by the power of the Holy Ghost. Of
00:09:28.320 this I testify in the name of Jesus
00:09:30.800 Christ. Amen. Amen.
