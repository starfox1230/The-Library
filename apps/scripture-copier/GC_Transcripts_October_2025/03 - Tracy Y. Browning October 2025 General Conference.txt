00:00:01.120 One of the blessings of my service in
00:00:03.120 primary is that my heart has learned to
00:00:05.279 love in languages that my tongue does
00:00:07.359 not speak. I have found joy in
00:00:10.480 connecting with fellow saints through
00:00:12.160 the shared language of sacred music and
00:00:15.120 especially through the simple songs of
00:00:17.279 primary. The Holy Spirit has transcended
00:00:20.320 language barriers and filled my heart
00:00:22.560 with his whispering. In children's
00:00:24.960 voices, the love of God and his son
00:00:26.880 Jesus Christ has been proclaimed in
00:00:29.039 clear, piercing truth. Although I did
00:00:32.320 not grow up in primary, the spirit has
00:00:34.320 quickly taught me the sacredness of its
00:00:36.239 songs and they have become part of my
00:00:38.399 personal worship. Primary songs have
00:00:41.040 carried a holy influence in my life and
00:00:43.120 have lifted my soul, taught me eternal
00:00:45.760 truth, and drawn me nearer to the Savior
00:00:48.399 and to his gospel. President Don H. Oaks
00:00:51.760 once taught that the singing of hymns is
00:00:53.840 one of the best ways to learn the
00:00:55.600 doctrine of the restored gospel. Those
00:00:58.320 words are true for all of us, but are
00:01:00.719 especially so for children. Primary
00:01:03.680 music is one of God's most tender tools
00:01:06.240 for planting the seeds of testimony in
00:01:08.960 the hearts of the Savior's youngest
00:01:10.960 disciples. Parents, leaders, and
00:01:13.360 teachers give nourishment to that seed
00:01:15.680 as they testify to and invite the
00:01:18.799 testimonies of children of all they are
00:01:21.280 coming to know of Heavenly Father, his
00:01:23.680 son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost. In
00:01:27.040 these last several years of my service,
00:01:28.880 I have spent time singing and learning
00:01:30.960 from primary music while contemplating a
00:01:33.520 few questions. How can primary songs
00:01:36.400 learned in childhood become the
00:01:38.079 spiritual language children use to
00:01:40.479 testify for the rest of their lives? How
00:01:43.200 does singing gospel truths help children
00:01:45.280 remember the Lord as part of their
00:01:47.040 covenant and prepare them for his
00:01:48.799 ordinances? And how can primary songs
00:01:51.600 help write God's law upon the hearts of
00:01:53.759 these youngest disciples? When primary
00:01:56.720 began in 1878, its first president,
00:01:59.040 Aurelia Spencer Rogers, observed that
00:02:01.200 singing was necessary. Music has always
00:02:04.240 been at the heart of teaching children
00:02:05.600 the gospel. Primary songs can become a
00:02:08.318 child's first spiritual language because
00:02:10.239 their simple, memorable melodies give
00:02:12.879 voice to gospel truths. These songs hold
00:02:15.599 the power to stay with children for a
00:02:17.520 lifetime, becoming part of their
00:02:19.280 disciplehip and a natural and normal way
00:02:22.239 for them to testify of the Savior.
00:02:25.440 Primary songs can also be powerful
00:02:27.680 doctrinal teaching tools. Some songs
00:02:30.560 tell the stories of the Savior's life
00:02:32.400 and ministry. Others teach of his
00:02:34.800 attributes such as his faith, his hope,
00:02:37.280 and his charity. And the most sacred
00:02:40.000 songs testify of his infinite atonement
00:02:42.720 and the love that flows from that act of
00:02:44.879 salvation.
00:02:46.560 A prophet of the Lord, President Russell
00:02:48.879 M. Nelson taught, "Music can exert a
00:02:51.920 continuing influence for good well
00:02:53.760 beyond times when children are small. It
00:02:56.160 has the power to provide spiritual
00:02:57.760 nourishment. It has healing power. It
00:03:00.400 has the power to facilitate worship. It
00:03:02.879 allows us to contemplate the Savior's
00:03:04.640 atonement and the restoration of the
00:03:06.319 gospel with its saving principles and
00:03:08.879 exalting ordinances. Music provides
00:03:11.840 power for us to express prayerful
00:03:13.760 thoughts and bear testimony of sacred
00:03:16.159 truths.
00:03:18.000 As parents, leaders, and teachers, our
00:03:20.159 efforts include helping children access
00:03:22.560 these promised blessings by teaching
00:03:24.959 with intention the gospel truths found
00:03:26.959 in the music. President Nelson also
00:03:29.519 taught that children can learn the
00:03:31.040 doctrine when they're learning to sing
00:03:33.040 just as much as they can learn the
00:03:34.560 doctrine in a class. These songs can
00:03:37.760 provide a reservoir of faithfilled
00:03:40.080 sermons that point children to the
00:03:41.760 Savior and help them develop devotion to
00:03:44.400 his gospel. The scriptures teach that
00:03:47.040 the songs of the righteous that come
00:03:48.640 from the heart are a delight to the
00:03:50.400 Savior. I can only wonder at the delight
00:03:53.440 that the voices of the Savior's youngest
00:03:55.840 disciples bring. I know their prayerful
00:03:58.799 songs reach heaven as expressions of
00:04:00.879 faith that invite the Holy Spirit to
00:04:03.200 confirm eternal truths and softly and
00:04:06.239 tenderly invite others to accept the
00:04:08.799 call of our savior to follow him and
00:04:11.200 come home. As Elder Henry B Iring has
00:04:14.560 reminded us, it is in those moments of
00:04:16.560 feeling the spirit that we have evidence
00:04:19.040 of the Savior's atonement working in our
00:04:21.440 lives.
00:04:22.960 Primary music can be a miracle carried
00:04:25.360 along the lifelong arc of disciplehip
00:04:27.360 that our children will travel. A song
00:04:29.680 learned at age six has the power to stay
00:04:31.840 with us and can return decades later in
00:04:34.720 moments of decision, temptation, grief,
00:04:37.520 or joy. Perhaps in our later years, the
00:04:41.040 lyrics of I will follow God's plan may
00:04:44.080 serve as a spiritual anchor that echoes
00:04:46.639 the witness of the Apostle Paul of the
00:04:49.120 shorty of God's promises to us. Or they
00:04:52.160 may remind us that because God keeps his
00:04:54.560 promises, his covenants offer strong
00:04:57.040 consolation and a place of refuge and
00:04:59.680 invite us to put our hope and assurance
00:05:02.000 steadfastly on Jesus Christ and in his
00:05:04.720 atoning power. Adult members across the
00:05:08.000 globe in times of difficulty often
00:05:10.080 remember enter to the primary songs they
00:05:12.960 learned as children. For many these
00:05:15.440 songs supported the early architecture
00:05:17.280 of their faith in Jesus Christ and were
00:05:19.759 the first place where conversion to his
00:05:22.000 gospel began. Parents, leaders and
00:05:24.639 teachers nurtured that faith through the
00:05:26.639 years by teaching, singing and
00:05:28.400 testifying to children with care.
00:05:31.520 One sister shared with me that she
00:05:33.199 cherished primary music and after 20
00:05:35.600 years she credits it with the
00:05:37.199 accelerating of her continued conversion
00:05:39.280 to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Another
00:05:42.400 member testified that primary planted a
00:05:44.560 mustard seed of faith when he was young
00:05:46.880 and was the reason he was able to come
00:05:49.039 back to the Lord's church in his 30s.
00:05:52.000 The Savior promised, "The Comforter
00:05:54.800 shall teach you all things and bring all
00:05:57.520 things to your remembrance." Primary
00:06:00.160 music can be one way that promise is
00:06:02.560 fulfilled.
00:06:04.319 Another beloved primary song captures
00:06:06.560 the power of simple faith and enduring
00:06:09.199 testimony.
00:06:10.800 As I walk with Jesus to my home above,
00:06:14.400 he will bless me with his spirit and
00:06:16.960 fill me with his love. Change my heart
00:06:20.080 forever and help me clearly see. I will
00:06:23.919 walk with Jesus and he will walk with
00:06:27.039 me. As children sing, they are
00:06:30.000 expressing the desire of a disciple and
00:06:32.160 learning the pattern of covenant living.
00:06:34.560 The spirit can use music to engrave
00:06:37.039 eternal truths on their tender hearts.
00:06:39.280 And in time, children can choose to tune
00:06:42.479 and turn their hearts and their lives
00:06:45.039 towards Jesus Christ by making and
00:06:47.680 keeping sacred covenants with him.
00:06:50.720 Sacred music can help write the doctrine
00:06:52.880 of Christ into the soul and prepare us
00:06:55.039 to receive his ordinances. It links the
00:06:57.520 savior's doctrine to our memory and that
00:06:59.599 memory to our disciplehip in him. As
00:07:02.160 primary leaders, we have the opportunity
00:07:04.080 and the sacred responsibility to ensure
00:07:06.560 that music in primary is taught with
00:07:08.639 joy, with doctrinal understanding, and
00:07:10.960 with the spirit. This includes inviting
00:07:13.599 children to notice what they feel as
00:07:15.680 they sing and helping them recognize
00:07:18.000 that those feelings come from the Holy
00:07:19.680 Ghost. These efforts help prepare our
00:07:22.240 children for sacred ordinances such as
00:07:24.319 baptism and confirmation as well as
00:07:26.880 inspiring their covenant memory as they
00:07:29.440 regularly renew their promises to God.
00:07:32.800 At the last supper, after the Savior
00:07:34.960 instituted the sacrament, Matthew
00:07:36.720 records that when they had sung in hymn,
00:07:39.280 they went out into the Mount of Olives.
00:07:41.840 Each week, baptized and confirmed
00:07:43.759 members of the Lord's church, including
00:07:46.160 baptized children as young as 8 years
00:07:48.400 old, prepare to take the Lord's
00:07:50.160 sacrament. Through singing sacred music,
00:07:52.960 congregations of God's children are
00:07:54.800 given an opportunity to prepare their
00:07:57.039 hearts for that sacred ordinance, to
00:07:59.120 take upon themselves his name, to always
00:08:01.919 remember him, and to keep his
00:08:03.840 commandments.
00:08:05.759 Dear friends, I testify that primary
00:08:08.400 songs teach eternal truths and doctrines
00:08:10.879 that lead us to Jesus Christ in his
00:08:12.720 gospel. I invite you to consider what
00:08:15.520 foundational truths have been written
00:08:17.120 into your hearts through the simple
00:08:19.199 teachings of these songs and to testify
00:08:22.080 of those truths to the Savior's youngest
00:08:24.560 disciples as you teach them the good
00:08:27.120 news of the gospel through song. I know
00:08:30.240 that God our father in his infinite love
00:08:32.479 sent his beloved son to earth to teach
00:08:34.479 us to show us the way and to redeem us
00:08:37.200 through his atonement. I know that the
00:08:39.599 Savior's life and ministry are real and
00:08:42.320 personal. The scriptures are full of
00:08:45.040 stories of his healing, his kindness,
00:08:47.200 and his miracles. I know that Heavenly
00:08:50.240 Father hears and answers the sincere
00:08:52.160 prayers of his children, no matter their
00:08:54.399 age, circumstance, or language. He
00:08:56.800 listens to the quiet pleadings of our
00:08:58.720 hearts. I testify that in Gethsemane,
00:09:01.680 Jesus Christ bore the weight of our
00:09:03.279 sins, sorrows, and pains. He suffered
00:09:05.839 willingly because of his love for us and
00:09:08.640 made it possible for us to be forgiven
00:09:10.640 and to return home. I know that we are
00:09:13.519 literal children of God, created in his
00:09:15.760 image, endowed with divine potential and
00:09:18.399 invited to return to live with him if we
00:09:20.720 choose to follow Jesus Christ. I know
00:09:23.519 that Jesus Christ is our perfect
00:09:25.360 example. And as we follow him by
00:09:27.839 serving, forgiving, and loving others,
00:09:29.760 we become more like him day by day. And
00:09:33.040 I know that the Lord's holy temples are
00:09:35.040 his house here on earth. In them, we
00:09:38.160 make sacred covenants, receive eternal
00:09:40.480 blessings, and learn more of him, and
00:09:42.399 feel more of his presence. The temple is
00:09:45.279 a place of learning, peace, and
00:09:47.200 preparation for our lives. I testify
00:09:50.160 that the efforts we make to teach and
00:09:52.160 sing these primary songs to our children
00:09:55.200 are not simply a nice part of our
00:09:57.279 religious tradition. They are sermons
00:09:59.680 for disciples of Jesus Christ.
00:10:02.080 testimonies to the truthfulness of the
00:10:03.839 restored gospel and prayer set to music.
00:10:06.880 Sacred music can shine the light of
00:10:08.959 Christ on the hearer and pour it into
00:10:11.519 the heart of the singer. Dear friends,
00:10:14.880 Jesus still wants us for a sunbeam. I so
00:10:18.079 testify in the sacred name of Jesus
00:10:20.959 Christ. Amen. Amen.
