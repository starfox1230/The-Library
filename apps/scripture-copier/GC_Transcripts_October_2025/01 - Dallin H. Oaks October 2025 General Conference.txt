00:00:01.040 My dear brothers and sisters,
00:00:04.080 we meet as we mourn the death of our
00:00:06.480 beloved President Russell M. Nelson.
00:00:10.639 I speak to you as the president of the
00:00:13.759 quorum of the 12
00:00:16.239 in which position I have been sustained
00:00:20.160 in each of our ward stake and general
00:00:23.039 conferences for the past seven and a
00:00:25.680 half years.
00:00:28.320 We now go forward with this semiannual
00:00:30.880 general conference proceeding as planned
00:00:34.559 and with speakers and music assigned by
00:00:38.399 President Nelson after months of
00:00:41.280 preparation.
00:00:43.120 The only additions are my introductory
00:00:46.559 explanation
00:00:48.559 and my speaking in place of President
00:00:51.280 Nelson in the closing session on Sunday
00:00:54.640 afternoon.
00:00:57.120 This is the first time in about 75 years
00:01:01.199 that a church president has died a few
00:01:04.080 days before a general conference.
00:01:08.240 That has called for us to plan how we
00:01:10.880 could hold the vital leadership meetings
00:01:14.159 in connection with general conference as
00:01:17.360 well as this general session of
00:01:20.479 conference. At the same time, scheduling
00:01:23.600 his funeral as soon as possible.
00:01:27.600 President Nelson understood the value of
00:01:30.000 general conference to provide direction
00:01:33.040 to the saints in the coming months.
00:01:36.640 We honor him by following the planned
00:01:39.840 conference schedule he approved.
00:01:44.799 In this time of grief, we have already
00:01:47.040 held a meeting to pay tribute to
00:01:49.200 President Russell M. Nelson before our
00:01:52.560 general conference meetings and then
00:01:55.680 scheduled his funeral as soon as
00:01:57.920 possible after conference.
00:02:01.119 All of this has been done with the
00:02:02.960 approval of the family of President
00:02:05.680 Nelson and the quorum of the 12.
00:02:11.440 Since all of us who have been assigned
00:02:13.680 to speak in general conference
00:02:16.640 would like to devote our assigned time
00:02:19.440 to paying a personal tribute to
00:02:22.239 President Nelson.
00:02:24.640 We have therefore asked that all of our
00:02:28.000 conference speakers hold any such
00:02:30.959 tributes to a minimum, deferring
00:02:34.720 elaborate tributes for the funeral which
00:02:38.640 we have already begun to plan.
00:02:42.400 My own brief tribute suitable to this
00:02:45.360 conference and to the tributes we have
00:02:47.440 already paid is this.
00:02:50.560 I love Russell M. Nelson
00:02:54.400 and have learned more about the gospel
00:02:56.480 and gospel leadership from my long
00:02:59.120 friendship and association with him than
00:03:02.800 from any other leader I have personally
00:03:05.840 known.
00:03:07.360 He is our model as a servant and
00:03:10.400 follower of the Lord Jesus Christ.
00:03:13.840 Of these things I testify
00:03:16.640 in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
